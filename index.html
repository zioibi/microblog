			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="intro">Intro.</h3>
<p>I’ve been making these lists for more than two decades now, but each time November rolls around and it’s time to start chiseling down the mountain of a year’s releases into a set of twenty, I find myself falling into the same mental trap. I’ve become better at it over time, but I still find that I have to make the conscious effort to remind myself: I’m not trying to make a list of the objectively ‘best’ albums of 2023 — there are plenty of magazines and websites out there pretending that’s possible. My task is to produce a run-down of the twenty records that have brought <em>me</em> the most joy.</p>
<p>When I remember to think about things that way, the task of constructing the list becomes a little easier. It’s not a question of whether I think album Y is <em>better</em> than album Z: it’s about which made me smile more, hum more, sing more, dance more. So, here they are, the twenty album-length records, released in 2023, which moved me the most.</p>
<h3 id="20-jadu-heart-derealised">20. Jadu Heart — <em>Derealised</em></h3>
<p>There’s a lot going on in Jadu Heart’s sound. So much so, that early in my time with it, I had <em>Derealised</em> pigeonholed first as a post-shoegaze record, then as a dream-pop record, before (de)realising that it didn’t really matter which of their influences are strongest on any given track — their sound is their own. What the record has throughout, is a strong sense of core melodies, and a production style that layers hazy tones into the mix to arresting effect. ‘Cocoon’ is a straight-ahead, low-key pop song, where ‘I Shimmer’ is messier (and more clearly in debt to mbv). Never rushed — even at their most attention-demanding (eg. the Strokes-on-benzos push and pull of the aptly-titled ‘Sway’) these are songs that wash over the listener easily, casting their spell subtly. Album highlight ‘Freedom’ is perhaps the sound at its tightest, but even here it’s fuzzy at the edges, and loose in the weave. After the briefest of tours through some of their previous work, it seems this is an outfit still evolving, not content to settle into one sound. However, the songwriting (and mood-setting) here is of a quality that will keep me tuned in to see what’s next.</p>
<h3 id="19-metallica-72-seasons">19. Metallica — <em>72 Seasons</em></h3>
<p>I vividly recall the giddy feeling induced by the arrival of <em>Death Magnetic</em> in 2008: Metallica had finally released another album I truly liked, from start-to-finish, a full 17 years on from having last done so with their 1991 self-titled masterpiece. Subsequently, a less-than-impressive Lou Reed collaboration in 2011 left me cold, as did (the fairly well-received) <em>Hardwired… to Self-Destruct</em> (2016). Which meant, upon the arrival of <em>72 Seasons</em> in April, there was a heavy measure of relief in the mix for me, when the first listen confirmed what I’d dared not count on after three strong pre-released tracks: it was good! Like, really, properly good.</p>
<p>Eight months on, the bigger surprise is how relatively low the album has placed. There were a few weeks when I was playing the heck out of it, thrilled by its energy (highlight, and career top 30 contender ‘Lux Æterna’) and ambition (11-minute final track ‘Inamorata’). Over time the fire dimmed a little, and I’ve only made the trip through the full 77 minutes a few times in the latter half of the year. When I have, however, there’s still not a weak track to be found, and even if the front half feels stronger, latter highlights ‘Too For Gone?’ and the aforementioned epic closer, are not to be missed.</p>
<p><em>72 Seasons</em> is, by some measure, the ‘heaviest’ record on this list, and I’m not blind to the fact that nostalgia is playing its part here. I’m confident there were any number of ‘better’ metal records released in 2023, but I’m happy just to have the company of Lars and the boys once more. Even if you can only count on one great Metallica album every decade-and-a-half, it was a joy to have this one.</p>
<h3 id="18-sebastian-rochford--kit-downes-a-short-diary">18. Sebastian Rochford &amp; Kit Downes — <em>A Short Diary</em></h3>
<p>This is a set of delicate compositions for piano and drums, from previous Mercury nominee Kit Downes, and Sons of Kemet member / Polar Bear band-leader Seb Rochford (whom I’ve kept an eye on since <em>Peepers</em> (2010)). On reflection, it feels as though I listened to less jazz in 2023 than has been the case in recent years — the reason, if there is one, eludes me — but there were a small number of records I really enjoyed. This relatively brief collection of sparse, reflective pieces has not only lasted since I first played it in January, it has grown in my mind as I’ve found myself returning to it. Over that time I’ve found my enjoyment increasing alongside my ability to anticipate the melodies’ next step and turn. I’ve read comparisons to Bach and Mahler, the aptness of which lies beyond my ken. I do know that the interplay between the two instruments creates a kind of magic for me, as they find new and surprising ways to complement one another.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A hat tip is owed to Tyshawn Sorey, whose <em>Continuing</em> narrowly misses out on a place here. That record was eagerly anticipated by me, following his appearance in the top 10 of my 2021 list. It dropped mid-year, and I’ve spent far too little time with it up to this point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="17-screaming-females-desire-pathway">17. Screaming Females — <em>Desire Pathway</em></h3>
<p>As I write this, the news of Screaming Females breaking up is less than a week old. I’d arrived late to the band, thrilled by 2018’s <em>All At Once</em>, which placed 14th for me that year. Five years on, its no surprise that I was eager to receive another set of super-melodic, fuzzed up, alt rock treats, all carried along by Marissa Paternoster’s sidewinding guitar and singular vocals.</p>
<p>More than capable of operating across a few different gears — from the call to arms of opener ‘Brass Bell’ to the poppy jaunt of ‘Mourning Dove’, via arms-around-shoulders sing-along ‘Beyond the Void’ — the unifying element here is a well-honed ear for hooks, and a mastery of classic guitar / drums / bass dynamics. Each element enjoys its time to shine, but the delight is in how seamlessly it all fits together to make a sound that feels both familiar, and always welcome.</p>
<p>In their disbandment announcement, they are rightly proud of the approach they’ve taken over the last 18 years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We funded and made the records we wanted to make. We did our own art. We printed a lot of our own merch. We managed ourselves. Probably most importantly we loaded up our van with our gear and traveled around the world to play shows wherever you would have us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything about Screaming Females speaks of people who have music in their blood. I, for one, hope and expect to hear Paternoster’s voice again.</p>
<h3 id="16-unknown-mortal-orchestra-v">16. Unknown Mortal Orchestra — <em>V</em></h3>
<p>By the time I started paying attention to Spoon, with 2014’s <em>They Want My Soul</em>, they’d put out eight records over the course of almost two full decades. When I fell head-over-heels for Low’s <em>Double Negative</em> in 2018, they’d already put in a shift of 24 years and a dozen LPs. All of which is to say that, discovering Unknown Mortal Orchestra on their fifth (arguably sixth?) album, may be illustrative of profound ignorance on my part, but it’s not my worst offence.</p>
<p><em>V</em> proved to be a lot to digest at once. Whilst by no means overly long, the mood it conjures is such that the record plays for me like a 40 minute orchestral movement. It’s alternative music in a different, perhaps truer, sense: pop that has been shifted somehow into a weirder, more cerebral mode. For me <em>V</em> echoed some of the work of previous list grandee Toro y Moi. The production here is similarly gauzy, and the vocal delivery is akin to Chaz Bear’s languid style. This is easy-sounding music, which I fall easily into letting wash over me, though I’ve learned that closer attention pays dividends. I’m still not sure I’ve entirely grasped everything that’s going on here, but it’s a record that keeps compelling me back to dive deeper.</p>
<h3 id="15-k-lone-swells">15. K-Lone — <em>Swells</em></h3>
<p>K-Lone’s debut, <em>Cape Cira</em>, didn’t quite make my list in 2020, but it was in close contention right up until the end. (If I could put myself back into that mental space, I’d perhaps discover that its power had been diluted by the presence of work that year by Caribou, Georgia, and Four Tet, but who knows?) Here on album number two, the Brighton-based producer has really captured something special: unequal parts dub, synth-pop, and the ‘minimal’ end of house to which I’m so partial.</p>
<p>The opening of ‘Saws’ is misleading, its discordant vocal sample suggesting we might be in for something more disjointed and more difficult. It’s quickly subsumed in a warm bath of synth chords, with playful notes dancing atop. Perhaps this is intended to accustom the listener to keep their wits about them. The instrumentation remains fairly consistent throughout, with a particularly distinct percussion palette that underpins the whole ride, but that’s not to say the record doesn’t go places. These ten tracks seem to grow and bloom in front of the listener, each moment-to-moment twist a delight to behold. Playing with mournful reversed (?) string samples on ‘Strings’; adding a more prominent vocal on ‘With U’; reaching a dubby zenith on ‘Love Is’… the 46 minutes embrace a lot of different dynamics, and meld them into something captivating.</p>
<h3 id="14-puma-blue--holy-waters">14. Puma Blue — <em>Holy Waters</em></h3>
<p>The overall sonic profile of Puma Blue is unlike anything else I encountered this year. Jacob Allen’s other release of 2023 is a sparse, delicate rendition of Nina Simone’s ‘Twelfth of Never’, which is indicative of a fundamental element of his sound. It’s augmented on <em>Holy Waters</em> by a blend of trip hop-adjacent percussion, haunting synths, and other precisely arranged additions. Allen’s sultry, rich vocal always remains central, and whether he’s pining for an absent love (‘Hounds’) or ruminating on attachment (title track ‘Holy Waters’), it feels as though the instrumentation has been constructed — and given a spacious, dusky mix — so as best to support his poetic lyricism, and his delicate delivery. No small part of my enjoyment is owed to the fact that listening to <em>Holy Waters</em> feels as close as we can get to new material from the late Jeff Buckley.</p>
<p>There are also frequent jazz touches (eg. when the drums and bass get a little <em>Hail to the Thief</em>, on ‘Too Much, Too Much’), which only contribute further to a singular-sounding record that I found myself returning to repeatedly, ideally on headphones, after the sun had set.</p>
<h3 id="13-bully-lucky-for-you">13. Bully — <em>Lucky For You</em></h3>
<p>When writing last year&rsquo;s list, I noted the frequency with which artists were incorporating some flavour of shoegaze / dream-pop tone into their work. It&rsquo;s a trend that I&rsquo;ve noticed continuing this year, and nowhere more clearly than on <em>Lucky for You</em>. In the mix here are grungy guitar effects, fuzzed-up bass, and a vocal delivery that calls to my mind Sheryl / Alanis at their most forthright.</p>
<p>A few records this year fit roughly into this same category. I really enjoyed work by Claud (dreamier?), Blondshell, PONY (poppier?), and Sir Chloe – all were in shortlist contention; the latter could easily have been on the final list. What sets Bully apart for me is the consistently excellent songwriting, and the variety of ways Alicia Bognanno finds to play with the colours on her palate. The driving, bouncing &lsquo;Days Move Slow&rsquo;, followed by the more contemplative &lsquo;A Wonderful Life&rsquo; is but one of several mode shifts that land like marvellous one-two punches. To my mind, the record&rsquo;s strongest song (amongst many contenders) is the earnest &lsquo;How Will I Know&rsquo;, with its heartfelt plea of a chorus. It&rsquo;s unlikely to have been at all intentional, but it quickly became entangled in my mind with Olivier Assayas&rsquo;s movie <em>Personal Shopper</em> (2016), which I love beyond reason.</p>
<h3 id="12-illiterate-light-sunburned">12. Illiterate Light — <em>Sunburned</em></h3>
<p>Here’s a record I discovered quite early on in the year, and which was one of the first 2023 releases to make an impression. Illiterate Light’s sound reminded me a little of the likes of Screaming Trees: attuned perfectly to a particular wavelength of alt-rock, cut with Americana. The production on <em>Sunburned</em> also employs some tricks (such as applying the faintest echo to Jeff Gorman’s vocal) that result in the record sounding expansive and encompassing. It was only after a fair few listens that I discovered that Illiterate Light is only a two-piece! Shortly thereafter, I watched some live performance videos, bewitched by Jake Cochran’s use of a standing drum kit; stunned by Gorman playing synth with his feet, whilst also handling vocal and guitar duties.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to attribute the album’s tight execution, and very definite sense of a sound, to it being the product of only two people working in harmony. Whether or not that’s true, the result is a set of richly melodic compositions, shot through with an emotional weariness that occasionally gives way to moments of cathartic brightness. ‘Wake Up Now’ is a bombastic start, uncharacteristic in its general positivity; it presages stories of loss, relationship struggle, and paranoia, all expertly rendered, if a little gloomy. For my money, things go a little too far on the album’s only weak moment: penultimate track ‘Fuck LA’, which feels too slight and half-hearted, particularly compared to the colossal ‘Light Me Up’, or the personal-feeling ‘Hellraiser’.</p>
<p>NB. later in the year, the band released a four-track EP which is also great, but which plays with some much brighter moods on the tracks not titled ‘Cheap Divorce’.</p>
<h3 id="11-chris-farren-doom-singer">11. Chris Farren — <em>Doom Singer</em></h3>
<p>The loudest, sweatiest, most raucous gig I attended in 2023 was to watch Chris Farren (and, new addition to the touring outfit, drummer Frankie) tear apart a tiny room upstairs in an Oxford pub. The tour was in support of his fifth solo album, but he’s also a veteran of other outfits: Fake Problems, and Antarctigo Vespucci. I’m somewhat ashamed to say that I had no familiarity with any of those earlier records when I hit play on <em>Doom Singer</em> back in August. Since then it’s been in consistent rotation, its mix of poppy hooks, grungy riffs, and tongue-in-cheek lyrics an absolute delight from explosive start (‘Bluish’) to melancholy finish (‘Statue Song’). Farren’s sound captures all the melodicism I love in bands like Jimmy Eat World, and transmutes their earnestness with a playful sense of humour, without undercutting the emotional weight. Each three-minute dose of wit and verve is a delight to sing along to, with a wry smile on your face. Album highlight ‘Cosmic Leash’ stretches both the emotive and sonic range a little further, to wonderful effect.</p>
<p>I’ve dipped into more of Farren’s output since <em>Doom Singer</em> grabbed my attention, and it’s clear there’s a lot more where this came from. I’ll certainly be paying attention from now on.</p>
<h3 id="10-olivia-dean-messy">10. Olivia Dean — <em>Messy</em></h3>
<p>I think I first encountered Olivia Dean’s name amongst the nominees for this year’s Mercury Prize. By the time the award show itself rolled around, I would have given the statuette to her (even over Jockstrap’s <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em>, which I still rue leaving off last year’s list). <em>Messy</em> — inaptly titled by a perfectionist — is a record that feels so well put together, and of such consistent quality, that a few months into my relationship with it, I started to find it difficult to believe I hadn’t known some of these songs (the playful big band flirtation ‘Dive’; the sultry ‘The Ladies Room’) for years. And, the list continues: the immaculately polished R&amp;B of ‘The Hardest Part’; the sweet, coy poetry of ‘I Could Be a Florist’; the delightful family history of closer ‘Carmen’ – each showcases a talent for affecting lyricism, and a singer fully in command of their instrument: a little Lauren Hill, and a little Amy Winehouse.</p>
<p>Last year this same niche was filled for me by Amber Mark’s excellent <em>Three Dimensions Deep</em>, and whilst I don’t find that I chime with a great deal of modern, mainstream R&amp;B / soul, I deeply appreciate having had these records over the last couple of years, as a refuge of uncomplicated comfort. <em>Messy</em> has a warm and inviting aura that I reached for on several occasions, out of a desire simply to be close to that quality.</p>
<h3 id="9-andrea--due-in-color">9. Andrea — <em>Due in Color</em></h3>
<p>Mononymous Italian producer Andrea has been putting out work on the Zenker brothers’ label Ilian Tape for a decade, and whilst the name has crossed my awareness over the years, debut album <em>Ritorno</em> (2020) isn’t one that I remember playing. My first encounter with <em>Due In Colour</em>, however, came with a strong recommendation, and it does not disappoint. A melange of muted club beats, jazz-adjacent percussion, and washed out production, makes every minute of this record’s hour-plus runtime a mesmerising journey. Each composition flows one into the next, as the hazy instrumentation is carried through a range of tempos, from lounge chair to dance floor.</p>
<p>I feel like I go looking for an album roughly in this space each year, and since I was tipped to <em>Due in Color</em> back in March, it has remained a go-to record for me whenever I’ve been in the mood. Only time will tell whether it wears as well for me as the very best examples of its kind, such as Shigeto’s <em>No Better Time Than Now</em> (17th in 2013), which I still play regularly.</p>
<h3 id="8-buck-65-super-dope">8. Buck 65 — <em>Super Dope</em></h3>
<p>I almost don’t need to write this entry. The one and only Legendary Buck 65 took second place on last year’s list, with his first album in seven years. As though surprising himself that he still had all this in him, he’s followed up in 2023 with not one, or two, but three records. One, a collaborative effort with Doseone and Jel, 25 years in the making. The other two, essentially straight-up sequels to last year’s <em>King of Drums</em>. Both May’s <em>Super Dope</em> and November’s <em>Punk Rock B-Boy</em> are cut from the same cloth as 2022’s glorious reemergence: immaculately constructed beats, and rhymes as clever and convoluted as they are goofily self-aware. Add in frequent, increasingly niche baseball shout outs, and it sometimes feels like these records are being made especially for me.</p>
<p>I’m listing <em>Super Dope</em> here because, at this point, I know it better. My suspicion is that, when I find more time to spend with the newer record, I’ll enjoy it just as much. These are albums with a lot to unpack, and it’s been my experience that they only grow on me over time. The same is true of my favourite of Buck’s 90s &amp; 00s output, but — if asked to choose — I might say we’re currently in his best era. I’ll take as many of these as he wants to put out.</p>
<h3 id="7-cut-worms--cut-worms">7. Cut Worms — <em>Cut Worms</em></h3>
<p>This self-titled release is Max Clarke’s third album as Cut Worms, and was a revelation to me when I happened upon it this summer. Despite sounding like a blend of Bright Eyes-esque folk, classic 60s rock n’ roll, and a strong dose of Americana, everything about this felt fresh and vital to me the first time I heard it, and 34 minutes later I found myself playing it again. The record’s balance of easygoing melody, simple constructions, and personal lyrics shot through with melancholy, feels earnest and honest, despite the sound’s affectations. It’s an album that invites you to share in the warmth of its lo-fi production, and to tap your foot to its relaxed pace. Each three minute track has the feel of having been discovered on some long-lost 7-inch, and polished to glowing life.</p>
<p>There’s something enormously endearing about both the world that Clarke’s songs conjure, and the way in which he’s delivering it. Though musically very different, it’s a spell that has similar effect to those early White Stripes records that I fell for two decades ago.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When it comes to sequencing this list each year, there’s usually a clear demarcating line between the very tip top, cream of the cream records, and a larger group that are all great, and deserving of a place, but which don’t shine quite so scorchingly bright. I loved my time with all fourteen records listed thus far, but the margins are thin between them, and between a dozen more records just over the horizon of a top 20. For me, there were half a dozen albums this year that were truly a cut above, and which I anticipate playing for years to come. Welcome to the top six.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="6-boygenius--the-record">6. boygenius — <em>the record</em></h3>
<p>Phoebe Bridgers' <em>Punisher</em> placed 17th on my 2020 list, and has had more staying power than at least five of the records that ranked above it. Lucy Dacus&rsquo;s <em>Historian</em> was in contention for a spot in 2018, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed her solo output since. I also enjoyed Julien Baker&rsquo;s 2021 LP <em>Little Oblivions</em>, but of the trio that comprise boygenius, she was perhaps the least well known to me. It quickly became clear on a couple of listens, however, that boygenius is a true gestalt: the sum greater than the parts.</p>
<p>Opening <em>a capella</em> number ‘Without You Without Them’ might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly an effective showcase of how well the three voices harmonise. And such is the joy of <em>the record</em>: the lyrics (hip, knowing, sometimes resigned, often open-hearted), and the simple, spacious compositions, are certainly full of charm, but its the melding of three different voices and sensibilities into a magical whole, which truly magnetises. Fragility and strength ebb and flow throughout the album, both in terms of message and delivery. The (post-<em>a capella</em>) introductory trilogy of ‘$20’, ‘Emily I’m Sorry’, &amp; ‘True Blue’ (complete with interlinked videos (directed by Kristen Stewart)) is a microcosm of the set as a whole. As the three voices take it in turns supporting one another in telling personal stories in verse, you get the distinct feeling that this is a folk record in disguise. Even at its rockiest (‘Satanist’) its defining characteristic is raw emotionality. As heart-swollen and touching as anything from the era of peak Saddle Creek, these were songs I returned to countless times since the LP’s arrival in March, basking in increased familiarity.</p>
<h3 id="5-priya-ragu--santhosam">5. Priya Ragu — <em>Santhosam</em></h3>
<p>Priya was one of the most welcome surprises of 2021, taking third place on my list that year with her debut LP <em>damnshestamil</em>. There are cuts on there so well-honed and perfectly polished (&lsquo;Leaf High&rsquo;, &lsquo;Good Love 2.0&rsquo;, &amp; &lsquo;Chicken Lemon Rice&rsquo; amongst them) that I&rsquo;ll admit to a <em>soupçon</em> of doubt that another record would yield comparable results. There have been plenty of artists over the years, who have thrilled with their first offering, and then proven incapable of following up. Perhaps unfairly, the first to mind is La Roux: an exemplary debut in 2009, the quality of which hasn&rsquo;t been close to matched by anything on the subsequent two albums in the 14 years since.</p>
<p>Well, no such problem for Priya Ragu, who has filled <em>Santhosam</em> with fine examples of her unique blend of soul / hip-hop / R&amp;B and influences from her Sri Lankan-Tamil / Swiss upbringing. I still hear a little Janet (Miss Jackson if you&rsquo;re nasty) in the ease with which Priya does it, but truly this sound is entirely its own thing. Its infectious warmth and colour characterises track-after-track of immaculately danceable, smile-along pop. Even when tackling more difficult subject matter — such as racist policing on &lsquo;Black Goose&rsquo; — there&rsquo;s an undertone of communal understanding and unity. If proof were needed that Ragu is the real thing, it&rsquo;s in no short supply here. I&rsquo;m still listening to the debut with some regularity, and I also anticipate playing this for years to come.</p>
<h3 id="4-paramore--this-is-why">4. Paramore — <em>This Is Why</em></h3>
<p>Of Paramore’s previous output, <em>Brand New Eyes</em> is the previous high-water mark: 8th in 2009. Their self-titled record reached 12th in 2013, and <em>After Laughter</em> hit 10th in 2017. Obviously all of that is contextual, which perhaps explains why — ranked against one another — they would fall in an order other than that suggested by their relative competitiveness in their respective end-of-year running. We should also note front woman Hayley Williams’s solo work: <em>Petals for Armour</em> broke the top five on my 2020 list, before follow-up <em>Flowers for Vases / Descansos</em> failed to place the following year. All of this makes a kind of sense, if you can hold it all in your head at the same time. The folkier, sparser arrangements of the latter solo record didn’t work for me in the same way that the combination of Williams’s voice, artful lyric, and ear for a pop-rock hook have across other contexts. What’s more, at the close of 2023, I count myself as probably more of a Paramore fan than I have been at any point in the past. Looping <em>This Is Why</em> for weeks after its February release predictably led to some level of burnout. That led, in turn, to a revisiting of their previous work, which — despite the fact that I already knew it well — deepened my admiration for their dynamic, ambitious brand of pop-punk-dance-rock.</p>
<p><em>This Is Why</em> stands as perhaps the apotheosis of their style. It’s Paramore’s best record, and a showcase to the most mature version of their sound. The opener and title track is all groovy bass and slinky vocal, at least until its chant of a chorus; ‘The News’ is more jagged and motivated; ‘Running Out of Time’ is more narrowly focussed, but no less enthused. My personal favourite, since my early days with the album, has been ‘You First’, a synth-infused run up and down the gears that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Metric release.</p>
<p>The six years between releases — and Williams’ solo output — had me questioning whether Paramore were in fact on some kind of unannounced / unofficial hiatus. It’s been a pleasure to revel not only in their return, but in their having reached new heights.</p>
<h3 id="3-romy--mid-air">3. Romy — <em>Mid Air</em></h3>
<p>When, at the very beginning of opener &lsquo;Loveher&rsquo;, Romy Madley Croft softly intones a request to &ldquo;turn it up a bit more&rdquo;, I almost invariably comply. <em>Mid Air</em> is an album I want to be surrounded by and enveloped in, and a little additional volume helps cast the spell. Another vital ingredient is Croft&rsquo;s soft, sweet vocal, of which I&rsquo;ve always been a fan: The xx&rsquo;s <em>Coexist</em> placed 20th in 2012; <em>I See You</em>, 16th in 2017. Add in lyrics that tell personal and true-feeling stories about queer love and mental health, all suffused with a pleasing optimism. And on top of that, there&rsquo;s the production, which takes Fred Again..&rsquo;s (sic) intimate, soft-touch style and (for this listener) elevates it into a poppier mode.</p>
<p>From &lsquo;Loveher&rsquo; through to closer &lsquo;She&rsquo;s On My Mind&rsquo;, <em>Mid Air</em> quickly felt very much as though it had been conceived as an album, as opposed to discrete songs. Both the mood, and the unfolding romantic narrative feel like a single journey, though one with identifiable landmarks. &lsquo;The Sea&rsquo; is coy and meandering; &lsquo;Strong&rsquo; is the big beat peak; &lsquo;Did I&rsquo; dims the lights; late album highlight &lsquo;Enjoy Your Life&rsquo; is an unimpeachable dance anthem.</p>
<p>With this release, Romy eclipses her xx band mate Jamie xx&rsquo;s 8th place on my 2015 list, for his solo debut <em>In Colour</em>. At this point, I&rsquo;m impatiently awaiting another xx LP, and also more solo work from – with apologies to Oliver Sim, whose own solo record, <em>Hideous Bastard</em>, didn&rsquo;t entirely work for me last year – two of its members. If I could only have one though, at this point I&rsquo;d choose Romy in a heartbeat. No record felt more like an embrace this year than <em>Mid Air</em>.</p>
<h3 id="2-metric--formentera-ii">2. Metric — <em>Formentera II</em></h3>
<p>When it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. It’s more common in hip-hop (see eg. Jay-Z’s <em>In My Lifetime</em> vols. 1-3 &amp; <em>The Blueprint</em> 1-3), but if a rock band is going to release multiple albums’ worth of material under one title, it usually comes in the form of a double-album: classics of the genre include The Beatles’ <em>The Beatles</em> (1968), Fleetwood Mac’s <em>Tusk</em> (1979), and Nine Inch Nails’ <em>The Fragile</em> (1999).</p>
<p>There are confusing outliers, such as Smashing Pumpkins’ insistence on giving certain releases a subtitle or volume number, which series potentially never to be added to. Guns n Roses’ threw a curveball in 1991 with the tandem releases of <em>Use Your Illusion</em> volumes I &amp; II — essentially a double album, though you had to purchase both halves separately. All of which gave rise to conflicted feelings for me, when Metric announced that their 2022 masterpiece <em>Formentera</em> would get a direct continuation.</p>
<p>One cause for concern was the extent to which the situation seemed to echo Biffy Clyro having released <em>A Celebration of Endings</em> (14th for me in 2020), and then finding they had another album’s worth of material almost immediately. <em>The Myth of the Happily Ever After</em> (2021) was enjoyable enough, but did not place for me. Perhaps a more optimistic allegory would be Radiohead’s unfairly maligned <em>Amnesiac</em> (2001), certainly lesser than its immediate precursor, <em>Kid A</em> (2000), but a wonderful record in its own right. Was that a reasonable expectation?</p>
<p>You will recall, of course, that <em>Formentera</em> was my favourite album of last year, and at twelve months’ remove, I remain happy with that assessment. My end-of-2023 Apple Music rundown informs me that I have played no artist more frequently in this year than Metric, and it’s not exactly what might be considered close. The band also performed my favourite live show of the year: a couple of hours of synth-rock bliss at Camden’s Roundhouse, back in February.</p>
<p><em>Formentera II</em> itself very much continues the pandemic angst and desire for escapism that characterised the original record. Highlights include the ultra-catchy ‘Days of Oblivion’, the semi-autobiographical ‘Who Would You Be For Me’, and the teasing ‘Suckers’, which threatens to break out of itself at any moment. ‘Descendants’ feels like a closer, echoing some of the sentiments of epic <em>Formentera</em> opener ‘Doomscroller’, before actual closer ‘Go Ahead and Cry’ heralds the (false?) dawn of a new day, as we collectively awake from the fugue that Metric have so masterfully chronicled.</p>
<p>Happily, I needn’t have worried when Metric stood back from the near flawless <em>Formentera</em>, and asked “want to see us do it again?” Lesson learned: the answer to that question, from this band, should always be yes.</p>
<h3 id="1-olivia-rodrigo-guts">1. Olivia Rodrigo — <em>GUTS</em></h3>
<p>When it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. When last we heard from Olivia, she was heartbroken and frustrated in the aftermath of a relationship gone — pun intended — <em>SOUR</em> (2021). Two years later, Rodrigo’s latest dispatch is another hymn book full of remarkable pop-rock gems, this time squarely aimed at the trials and tribulations of young adulthood. The heat and glare of the spotlight on someone in her position is almost unfathomably oppressive to the average person, and yet Rodrigo not only handles it with grace, she finds the words to elucidate her situation in a manner that renders it relatable. Too quickly pigeonholed as a pop phenomenon, Olivia is a wildly underrated lyricist. Opener ‘all-american bitch’ is (like many of her songs) a bombastic, ultra-self-aware jam — in this case on the precarity and impossibility of modern womanhood. Taken alongside tracks like ‘making the bed’ and closer ‘teenage dream’, the listener bears witness to a supremely talented songwriter wrestling with expectation, fame, and the ephemerality of youth.</p>
<p>All of that sounds quite heavy, which is misleading, because <em>GUTS</em> is also home to the same infectious, effervescent <em>joie de vivre</em> that characterised <em>SOUR</em>. There was no more self-effacingly goofy song this year than ‘ballad of a homeschooled girl’, unless it was ‘love is embarrassing’. And then there’s lead single (and my favourite song of 2023), ‘vampire’: a masterclass in song construction that fits the highs and lows of a riveting emotional journey into little more than three minutes.</p>
<p>I hit <em>GUTS</em> so hard when it released in September, that I had to force myself into taking a break. As a substitute, I found myself regularly playing Cyndi Lauper’s <em>She’s So Unusual</em> (1983), a now 40 year old pop landmark that carries its message across four decades as clearly as a bell. That’s the company in which I place Olivia Rodrigo, even at this early point in her career. I hope she’s around for decades to come, explaining the world and the heart through the medium of perfect pop music.</p>

<p>I saw the news last night (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->GMT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and my jaw dropped. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone; perhaps the most widespread reaction to the news that the Chicago Cubs have fired manager David Ross, and signed Craig Counsell, is <em>shock</em>. And it&rsquo;s not because Counsell isn&rsquo;t a great manager — the argument can be (and has been) made, that he&rsquo;s the best in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MLB<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He&rsquo;s certainly in that conversation. What makes the move so stunning is that, at the end of the 2023 regular season, there was absolutely no talk that Ross&rsquo;s job was at risk. A hero of the Cubs' 2016 World Series team, universally beloved in the clubhouse, his managerial career had got off to a rocky start when the pandemic decimated the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%9322_Major_League_Baseball_lockout">a league-wide lockout</a> rendered Spring Training a mess, and delayed the start of the 2022 season. Arguably, 2023 was the only &lsquo;normal&rsquo; season of Ross&rsquo;s career at the helm, and when the Cubs fell frustratingly, agonisingly short of the playoffs, most voices agreed that it was a poor finish to a season that showed promise for a new core group of players.</p>
<p>Plus, Cubs' President of Baseball Operations, Jed Hoyer, had made no indications that a managerial change was on his mind. &ldquo;I was very pleased with Rossy this year,&rdquo; he <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jed-hoyer-addresses-david-ross-172702684.html">told reporters</a> at the end of the season. “Rossy had a great season, and the players play hard for him. He’s our guy.”</p>
<p>So, what changed? Quite possibly it&rsquo;s as simple as: Craig Counsell became available. All other things being equal, I think the Cubs go into the 2024 season with David Ross. But when arguably the sport&rsquo;s best manager hits the market, I guess you have to have that conversation — and apparently you have to <a href="https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2023/11/06/the-story-of-how-the-cubs-landed-craig-counsell-and-kept-it-completely-secret/">have it in absolute secrecy</a>, so that when the news lands, it hits like a brick.</p>
<p>There are other considerations. Perhaps the move is an argument that the Cubs see the position of Manager as more important than other teams. Maybe, as <a href="https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/2756518">The Score</a> ponders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the managerial role is one of the great remaining market inefficiencies in a game where seemingly every underpriced skill or trait has been unearthed in the 20 years since &ldquo;Moneyball&rdquo; was published</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps it means that <a href="https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2023/11/06/i-think-the-chicago-cubs-just-announced-that-they-will-be-extremely-aggressive-this-offseason/">The Cubs are going all in on 2024</a>. Even before the news of the new manager sent seismic waves through the National League, things were shifting for the Cubs. Marcus Stroman and Cody Bellinger have both hit free agency; Assistant General Manager Craig Breslow left for the Red Sox; strategy coach Craig Driver and bullpen coach Chris Young have both been let go. What the Counsell appointment means for the rest of the coaching staff remains to be seen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We&rsquo;ll also have to wait to see what other moves the front office make over winter. The hunt for an every-day first baseman continues, and there&rsquo;s the mouthwatering prospect of the <a href="https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2023/11/05/shohei-ohtani-sleeper/">bidding war for Shohei Ohtani</a>, whose next contract will almost certainly break all records.</p>
<p>There is some core continuity for next season, with <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/dansby-swanson-nico-hoerner-ian-happ-win-gold-glove-award">newly minted Gold Glove winners</a> Ian Happ, Dansby Swanson, and Nico Hoerner all returning (alongside lineup regulars like Seiya Suzuki, and others). Yan Gomes will be back behind the plate, and the option on (now only remaining player from the 2016 squad) Kyle Hendricks <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/cubs-options-kyle-hendricks-yan-gomes">has also been picked up</a>. But there&rsquo;s no denying that this change in leadership is a huge, shocking move. It&rsquo;ll take me a while to get used to seeing Craig Counsell on the top step of the Cubs' dugout.</p>

			 <p>On first watch — and I anticipate several — this, for me, was a film about belonging: to whom do things belong, and to where and to whom do people belong? What stories do we tell ourselves, and tell one another, about the places, groups, categories, and boxes in which we belong?</p>
<p>There are more finely-grained layers here — including a politics of place so specific, that I presume it lies beyond the full grasp of even other Californians — but the film succeeds so wildly on the human level as to welcome every viewer who has felt the pang of these questions.</p>
<p>Match that up with a visual sensibility that’s always finding new ways to capture the essence of a city (without reaching for gimmicks), a poetic screenplay with a real heartbeat, and a pair of strong, invested central performances… this felt like something special.</p>
<p>Me half an hour into the film: “Whoa, is that Daewon Song!?”</p>
<p>Me towards the end of the film: “Hey, that’s Thora Birch!”</p>
<p>Me watching the end credits: “Wait, that was Jello Biafra?”</p>

<p>The opening hours of <em>Alan Wake II</em> have touches from so many things I love: the original game — of course — but also <em>Control</em>, <em>House of Leaves</em>, a little <em>Max Payne</em>, and more than a pinch of <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>. One component of the gameplay is also a little like <em>Twin Peaks</em> meets <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, which is not a combination I knew I wanted until now.</p>

<p>On this date, 20 years ago, Sofia Coppola’s <em>Lost in Translation</em> (2003) had its UK premiere, at the BFI London Film Festival.</p>
<p>I’ve adored the film since I first saw it, and I&rsquo;m excited to wrap myself in a blanket this evening and revisit it for the first time in a few years. Hey — as it&rsquo;s now eligible, perhaps at some point I&rsquo;ll discuss it at length for an episode of <a href="https://zioibi.com/fo">Flux Observer</a>.</p>
<p>As readers of this blog may know, right now I&rsquo;m a couple of weeks out from visiting Tokyo for the first time. <em>Lost in Translation</em> is one of the pieces of media that has done the most to colour my idea of the city for the last two decades. Whilst I&rsquo;m cognisant of the fact that it&rsquo;s written and shot from a particular vantage point, I&rsquo;m expecting to have a moment or two, when I&rsquo;m there, in which I&rsquo;m reminded of the film.</p>
<p>If you have the time and inclination, there are few double-bills better than <em>Lost in Translation</em> &amp; Spike Jonze’s <em>Her</em> (2013). They were released almost exactly a decade apart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The two films are written &amp; directed by former spouses, and each of them won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

			 <p>One night this week, my special lady friend was otherwise occupied, which meant I got to indulge in a filmic treat for spooky season. She&rsquo;s not a horror fan, but it&rsquo;s one of those genres where I can have a good time with <em>almost</em> anything: from your A24-produced &lsquo;elevated&rsquo; piece, right down to your ridiculous, schlocky gore-fest with a terrible script. I also find that &lsquo;horror&rsquo; is a broad church. On the one hand you&rsquo;ve got movies shot as though lights weren&rsquo;t in the budget, relying on jump-scares and tense scores. On the other hand, there are more ruminative films that set out to unsettle and disturb in different ways. The two flicks I sat down to were decidedly of the latter camp: a double-bill of the latest offerings from the Cronenbergs, father &amp; son.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="crimes-of-the-future-2022-dir-david-cronenberg"><em>Crimes of the Future</em> (2022) dir. David Cronenberg</h2>
<p>Rarely has a film more aptly fit the descriptor &lsquo;unsettling&rsquo;. Taking place in a future where pain is eradicated and humans have begun to mutate, the particulars of this story&rsquo;s high-concept sci-fi are less interesting than the nuances it draws out of its cast. Frequent Cronenberg collaborator Viggo Mortensen croaks, groans, twitches, and constantly clears his throat as he embodies (literally) some mix of artist and art object. Kristen Stewart dials in a weird, but perfectly calibrated performance as a researcher who is at once infatuated, awestruck, nervous, and coy.</p>
<p>As with several entries in this strain of the director&rsquo;s work, there&rsquo;s a lot of (fairly gross) body horror stuff going on, and I was struck by how much better it works with practical effects than in those few cases where digital work is employed. The furniture in the home of Saul Tenser (Mortensen) is one example: a bed with fleshy limbs to turn him as he sleeps, and a chair seemingly formed of bones, which shakes and  jostles him as he attempts to eat. Their functions remain unexplained, but Cronenberg returns a few times to the discomfiting sight of Mortensen in one or the other&rsquo;s weird embrace.</p>
<p>As hard a film as it is to describe, it&rsquo;s equally hard to recommend to anyone who was not already likely to seek out new material from this director. For anyone who&rsquo;s on the fence, maybe start with <em>The Fly</em> (1986) or <em>eXistenZ</em> (1999), and know there&rsquo;s more where that came from.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Cronenberg used the same title for a short feature in 1970. I haven&rsquo;t seen it, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_of_the_Future_(1970_film)#Plot">the synopsis sounds truly crazy</a>.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="infinity-pool-2023-dir-brandon-cronenberg"><em>Infinity Pool</em> (2023) dir. Brandon Cronenberg</h2>
<p>In comparison to his father&rsquo;s film, Brandon Cronenberg&rsquo;s latest is a little easier to sit with. But that&rsquo;s an unusually high bar, and <em>Infinity Pool</em> is still a somewhat confounding piece of work. If I remember the trailer correctly, it doesn&rsquo;t reveal the film&rsquo;s <em>actual</em> central premise. I&rsquo;m all in favour of that kind of obfuscation, and so I&rsquo;m not about to spoil anything here. I will say that the film feels like a natural, and welcome, evolution from Brandon&rsquo;s previous feature, <em>Possessor</em> (2020), and tonally reminded me of elements of <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> (2016) crossed with Plan B &amp; Punchdrunk&rsquo;s 2020 TV event <em>The Third Day</em>.</p>
<p>Alexander Skarsgård gets to play a range between swaggering narcissist and terrified captive, and Mia Goth inhabits a new flavour of deranged weirdo with every bit of the screen presence she brought to roles in <em>X</em>  &amp; <em>Pearl</em> last year. How successful the film ultimately feels to you is going to hinge on how well you take to the premise, once it&rsquo;s revealed.</p>

<p>I just learned there’s <a href="https://mirandajuly.com/all-fours/">a new Miranda July novel</a> on the way. I loved her 2007 short story collection <em>No one belongs here more than you</em>, and <strong>adored</strong> her debut novel <em>The First Bad Man</em> (2015), so this is huge news for me.</p>
<p>I’m also a big fan of July’s film work. It kind of breaks my brain that <em>Me and You and Everyone We Know</em> (2005) is creeping up on two decades old, and 2020’s <em>Kajillionaire</em> is an absolute gem that I need to rewatch soon.</p>
<p>Also, if you have £3,500 you don’t know how to use, you could pick up one of 25 extant copies of this ‘book sculpture’: <a href="https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/services-br-miranda-july"><em>Services</em></a> July made in 2020.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Friends, I&rsquo;m still only half here, but I wanted to mention a couple of things I&rsquo;ve put out recently.</p>
<p>• Last week, after an unplanned hiatus of almost exactly a year, I sent a new issue of my occasional newsletter miscellany: <strong>Tendrils</strong>. You can browse a complete archive, and sign up for future issues, <a href="https://newsletter.zioibi.com">right over here</a>.</p>
<p>• This week, after a break of ~7 months, I released a new episode of my film &amp; music nostalgia podcast: <strong>Flux Observer</strong>. You can find a full archive, and links to the show in your podcast app of choice, <a href="https://podcast.zioibi.com">right over here</a>.</p>
<p>My setup for both of these uses no cookies, no trackers, no adverts, and no analytics. As such, I have no idea how many people are reading or listening, but that&rsquo;s absolutely fine with me. If you spend some time with one or the other, and want to get in touch, you can always <a href="mailto:hello@zioibi.com">drop me a line</a>!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Lately, instead of chain-listening to world affairs podcasts, I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time catching up with 2023 music releases that aren&rsquo;t eligible for <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/thelists">the end-of-year list</a>. Some highlights:</p>
<h3 id="celeste-latelyhttpsalbumlinkgbi1681347214">Celeste: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1681347214"><em>Lately</em></a></h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand what&rsquo;s going on with this release. Celeste appears to have put out a 5-track EP in 2019, titled <em>Lately</em>, and another in April of this year, with the same title. The 2023 version has three of the same tracks (in a different order), a pair of tracks from the superb 2021 album <em>Not Your Muse</em>, and a newer track: &lsquo;To Love a Man&rsquo;, which was released as a single in 2022.</p>
<p>Format weirdness aside, there&rsquo;s not a weak song here, and her voice remains rich and captivating. I&rsquo;ll take another album just as soon as it&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<h3 id="masca-sinkhttpsalbumlinkgbi1672708135">Masca: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1672708135"><em>Sink</em></a></h3>
<p>A 6-track EP rooted in Chvrches-esque synth-pop, but with added guitar in the mix, and a wider tonal gamut. I can&rsquo;t seem to find much on the band, but what&rsquo;s here is certainly interesting enough that I&rsquo;ll keep an ear out for whatever comes next. The song &lsquo;Animal&rsquo; feels like something of a misstep, but the two tracks that follow more than make up for it. Title track (?) / closer, &lsquo;Sink Sink&rsquo; is going into rotation for a while.</p>
<h3 id="darkside-live-at-spiral-househttpsalbumlinkgbi1688528298">DARKSIDE: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1688528298"><em>Live at Spiral House</em></a></h3>
<p>Second live album from Nicolás Jaar&rsquo;s DARKSIDE project. I&rsquo;ve been really into the two studio albums released under this name, even if my favourite recent Jaar release remains <em>2012-2017</em>, the 2018 LP he put out as Against All Logic. This live set imbues the sound with a real sense of space, and a bit of looseness.</p>
<h3 id="cole-pulice-if-i-dont-see-you-in-the-future-ill-see-you-in-the-pasturehttpssonglinkgbi1687041712">Cole Pulice: <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1687041712">&lsquo;If I Don&rsquo;t See You in the Future, I&rsquo;ll See You in the Pasture&rsquo;</a></h3>
<p>I enjoyed Pulice&rsquo;s album <em>Scry</em> towards the end of last year. This is listed as an EP, but it&rsquo;s a single track. Music like this feels like an antidote to atrophied attention; if you can be present with this song for 22 minutes, it&rsquo;ll take you somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="kode9--burial-infirmary--unknown-summerhttpsalbumlinkgbi1689652620">Kode9 / Burial: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1689652620">&lsquo;Infirmary&rsquo; / &lsquo;Unknown Summer&rsquo;</a></h3>
<p>A split single with a split personality — if these two weren&rsquo;t on the same label, the logic behind this would be questionable. But I guess when you <em>run</em> the label, you can do what you want. Kode9&rsquo;s frenetic, choppy piece is outshone by Burial&rsquo;s dreamier, adventurous second offering.</p>
<h3 id="saoirse-fabric-presents-saoirse-mixedhttpsalbumlinkgbi1690599889">Saoirse: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1690599889"><em>fabric presents Saoirse (Mixed)</em></a></h3>
<p>I have a private Soundcloud queue where I&rsquo;ll throw any mix I hear about that sounds appealing — it serves as perfect background / writing music a lot of the time, but every now and then something starts playing that gets me out of my chair. This is the best set I&rsquo;ve heard recently.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/10/01/its-that-time.html">The End of the 2023 Online Season 🍂</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/10/01/its-that-time.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-10-01 15:02:23 &#43;0000">Oct 1, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again. Today, I kicked some dry leaves on a walk into town, bought and drank my traditional one-per-annum Pumpkin Spice Latte™, and listened to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1589139584"><em>Red (Taylor&rsquo;s Version)</em></a> with rapture.</p>
<p>A whole 364 days ago, I wrote what proved to be <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/tendrils022/">the final issue</a> (to date) of my erstwhile newsletter. In it, I explained the reasons behind my practice of taking an extended period each year, away from the social internet. I won&rsquo;t repeat all that here; it suffices to say that when the Chicago Cubs are playing baseball, you&rsquo;ll find me online, and when they&rsquo;re not, I aim to be far less connected. The way things have worked out, a rough month for the Cubs has seen playoff hopes evaporate, and the final game of the season is due to start in just a few hours' time. Hence, I&rsquo;m publishing this note to say goodbye for a while — there will be less activity here between now and next spring.</p>
<p>Some people reading this may recall that, last time around, the whole &lsquo;defaulting to disconnection&rsquo; thing didn&rsquo;t work out as planned. Elon Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->RIP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) a few weeks after I pulled the plugs, created such fascinating turmoil that I couldn&rsquo;t look away. As I wrote here <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html">back in January</a>, the earthquakes sent through the landscape of the social web felt genuinely exciting for a while. Mastodon had a moment; Bluesky threatened to have a moment, and then never really did; many others (cohost; T2 / Pebble; Nostr; Post News) made ripples of varying sizes; Meta launched Threads to great fanfare, and then set about the harder work of making it stick. All of which is beside the point to a large extent, save to say that — for me — the excitement has given way to baseline intrigue. The rise and fall of individual platforms is less interesting than the fact that things are changing. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve very much enjoyed continuing to share notes and updates of various types right here.</p>
<p>Will I continue to post throughout my offline season? Possibly. The long-heralded trip to Japan is a few weeks away, and will likely yield a good number of photos — some of those will probably appear here. I&rsquo;ll also feel free to drop by with anything else that seems worth saying. As explained in that post from a year ago, this isn&rsquo;t a monastic practice, but a shift in default. One thing is virtually certain: the <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/thelists">end of year list</a> of my favourite records of 2023 will be posted in the final week of the year.</p>
<p>For now, let me wish you a happy and cosy autumn and winter. Keep the internet warm for me, and I hope to be back here with you next spring. The Cubs play the White Sox, Friday 23 February 2024, 14:05 CST.</p>
<p>If you need me in the meantime, <a href="mailto:hello@zioibi.com">you can always write</a>.</p>

			 <p>With the exception of a few key things — travel money; travel insurance; transport to the airport — it feels increasingly as though the planning for our upcoming trip to Japan is in good shape. All of the hotels are booked; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SIM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cards are in hand; rail passes are winging their way here as I type; I even managed to successfully navigate the byzantine complexities of booking tickets for Universal Studios.</p>
<p>Alongside all of the admin, there have been a couple of other strands of prep: I&rsquo;ve been watching a <em>lot</em> of YouTube videos (of varying quality and usefulness), and taking notes as I&rsquo;ve made my way through the guidebooks I <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/06/20/back-in-january.html">posted about a while ago</a>. Another book just got added to that stack, with the news that W. David Marx&rsquo;s <em>Ametora: How Japan Saved American Style</em> (2015) is <a href="https://culture.ghost.io/ametora-revised-edition-2023/">being reissued in a revised edition</a>.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to read more Japanese fiction in the run-up. I&rsquo;ve long been an admirer of some of the bigger names: I read some Banana Yoshimoto in my teens; Haruki Murakami, about whom I&rsquo;ve written before (<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2015/01/17/in-praise-of.html">1</a>, <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv2">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/04/12/a-feminist-critique.html">3</a>); &amp; Sayaka Murata (whose <em>Convenience Store Woman</em> (2016 trans. 2018) remains one of my favourite reading surprises in recent memory. In an effort to broaden those horizons somewhat, I&rsquo;m currently enjoying Emi Yagi’s <em>Diary of a Void</em> (2023) &amp; Seichō Matsumoto’s <em>Tokyo Express</em> (1958 trans. 2023).<br>

			 <p>I have just archived 63% of the entries in my Contacts, keeping only the people I&rsquo;ve communicated with — one way or another — across the last five years or so. It&rsquo;s amazing how much extraneous stuff builds up in these places if you&rsquo;re not paying attention: your old landlord; people you worked with for two weeks, eight years ago; window cleaners from other places you&rsquo;ve lived.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another tier, of folks you once called friends, but one or other of you moved on from a job, or a city. There&rsquo;s a tinge of sadness in archiving those names and numbers, and it&rsquo;s partially attributable to how historically poor I am at keeping in touch with people. Honestly, it&rsquo;s bordering on a failure to grasp object permanence! People who still regularly talk with their old school friends, and former colleagues, put me to shame.</p>
<p>When it comes to physical clutter, I try my hardest to resist the <a href="https://youtu.be/9dmeWE-qfMo">&lsquo;Monica&rsquo;s closet&rsquo;</a> approach; I&rsquo;m pretty good at letting that stuff go. When it comes to digital clutter though, I see little harm in keeping it around past its immediate usefulness, as long as it&rsquo;s all organised in some way. I have a partitioned external hard drive dedicated to timestamped backups and archives of this kind: a whole lot of 1s &amp; 0s, not cluttering up the place day-to-day, but retrievable if it should become necessary. You never know when someone might ask for a window cleaner recommendation.</p>

			 <p><strong>Another batch of quick notes:</strong></p>
<p>• Circumstances over the last couple of weeks have conspired to preclude my seeing <a href="https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/past-lives"><em>Past Lives</em></a> in cinemas, which I&rsquo;m disappointed about. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll arrive on MUBI in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>• Depending on the day you ask, I might tell you that my favourite record of all time is Nirvana&rsquo;s <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1440858699"><em>In Utero</em> (1993)</a>, which was released <strong>30 years ago today</strong>.</p>

			 <p><strong>As an experiment, things I’ve jotted down during the day:</strong></p>
<p>• A striking sentiment in this piece by <a href="https://newsletterss.com/post/2VWWSt7Zjsq3yoKyv9gNYt5AgFa/rss">Annie Lowrey</a>:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You read a poem; it takes three minutes or 20 minutes; you get drop-kicked out of the galaxy and torn apart and rebuilt and returned home anew.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>• The mix of sounds and styles on <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1690201036">Corinne Bailey Rae’s new LP</a> is head-spinning.</p>
<p>• Eight days since I <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/09/09/yesterday-afternoon-i.html">messed my ankle up</a> — the swelling has receded; most of the bruising has begun to fade a little; I’m now fairly mobile on the flat, and going up stairs, but down stairs remains a tricky proposition. Still quite a fair bit of soreness though, and if that persists a few days beyond the bruising, maybe I’ll go see about an x-ray to check I didn’t fracture something.</p>
<p>• Very much enjoyed my second playthrough of the Puma Blue LP: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1682664550"><em>Holy Waters</em></a> (2023)</p>
<p>• I loved this Sophie Robinson poem: <a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/sophie-robinson-poem/">‘art in america’</a></p>
<p>• Babak Jalali’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wu8CzVfik-4"><em>Fremont</em> (2023)</a> isn’t playing anywhere near me right now, but I will absolutely see it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASAP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>• I’ve kept an eye on Cory Doctorow’s work for many years; the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/have-a-nice-future-podcast-21/">latest episode of Wired’s <em>Have a Nice Future</em> podcast</a> is a succinct encapsulation of where his thoughts about the internet stand right now.</p>
<p>• If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I need to go and update iOS, chiefly so that I can create inline links in Apple Notes!</p>

			 <p>For the record, I don&rsquo;t listen to all that much metal. I used to — for around a decade, starting in the mid 90s, it was one of the staples of my listening diet. My most music-obsessed friend still enjoys a lot of the stuff, and suggestion from him is how most of the metal crops up on these lists. I&rsquo;m always happy to dip into any record once, and every now and again, I still find something that ignites a spark. I mention this now because there&rsquo;s a new Otep LP released this week, and <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/724782295">their debut ep from 2001</a> was a revelation to me at the time. I do not hold out much hope that this new album will have similar impact. 🎵</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently deep in the planning stages for a trip to Japan in a couple of months' time. Flights and hotels are all booked, and SIM cards have been acquired. I&rsquo;ve done my research on things like public transport and the necessity of having both cash and a Suica card in your pocket at all times. I&rsquo;ve figured out which Japan Rail Pass option works best (given that we&rsquo;re going to be using it both directions between Tokyo and Kyoto, as well as down to Osaka), I just need to pre-order it for collection.</p>
<p>Honestly, the most confusing aspect of the whole trip so far has been coming to grips with the overly-complex method for securing entry to <a href="https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/about">Super Nintendo World</a>!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The most recent research I&rsquo;ve been conducting is on architecturally significant buildings, and I wanted to take a second to note the extent to which Kenzō Tange&rsquo;s design for St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral in Sekiguchi (constructed 1963-4), resembles a PlayStation 5.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>A note of follow-up to <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/09/12/its-that-time.html">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>: the Apple event went pretty much as expected. They got that brief Apple Vision Pro segment in at the top, and unveiled some neat evolutions to both Apple Watch and iPhone. The former arguably got the bigger bump, with the new phones a more modest update. Nevertheless, I saw what I needed to regarding the camera specifically: the jump from the 12MP on my iPhone 12, to the 48MP on an iPhone 15 (with double the optical zoom) is substantial.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from the new hardware, I applaud the company&rsquo;s discontinuation of leather products. This was framed as part of a comprehensive environmental sustainability project, but also has significant animal welfare implications.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time again: Apple Event day, and this is an upgrade year for me. More by circumstance than design, I tend to pick up every third iPhone. And, whilst the performance of my iPhone 12 is still perfectly good, the battery has certainly started to degrade. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of planning a trip to Japan this autumn, and I&rsquo;ll want to have the best camera possible in my pocket. I&rsquo;m excited to tune in a little later and learn what&rsquo;s on offer; my expectation is that — beyond the switch to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->USB-C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the debut of Dynamic Island on non-Pro models — the hardware will be a relatively modest update.</p>
<p>Beyond the new iPhones, and the expected new Apple Watch model, I&rsquo;m wondering whether any time will be devoted to Apple Vision Pro. Even if it&rsquo;s limited to a short segment showcasing a different use case, I&rsquo;d expect that Apple will want to remind the world that the product exists, and is shipping relatively soon.</p>
<p>On the software side: there&rsquo;s plenty in iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, &amp; macOS Sonoma that I&rsquo;m keen to play with<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.

<p>Another set of visual inspo bookmarks, as I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/categories/visual-inspo/">shared before</a>. Previously, I was cataloguing these in a service called Savee, which is still a good source, but I don&rsquo;t recommend the tool: significant elements of their Pro plan simply do not work, and their customer service was lacking. I did some looking around at alternatives (eg. <a href="https://dropmark.com">Dropmark</a>, which I used many years ago; <a href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>, which seems popular), but I&rsquo;ve now taken to scrapbooking them in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-freeform-a-powerful-new-app-designed-for-creative-collaboration/">Freeform</a>, which is proving to be ideal for just this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll continue to showcase a selection here from time-to-time though.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/olivia-rodrigo-and-phoebe-bridgers-let-it-all-out">conversation between Olivia Rodrigo &amp; Phoebe Bridgers</a> was fun — including the part where they start talking about <em>Beau is Afraid</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RODRIGO: I watched that new Ari Aster movie <em>Beau Is Afraid</em> and I got so scared. I literally had to walk out of the theater. I have never had such a visceral reaction to a movie in my life. It felt like a bad acid trip.</p>
<p>BRIDGERS: [Laughs] I&rsquo;m so glad you brought that up, because you are right. That is the scariest movie I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but I was laughing the entire time.</p>
<p>RODRIGO: That&rsquo;s the only reasonable reaction. Your body just can&rsquo;t process it. You have to laugh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently bought <em>Beau is Afraid</em>. When I saw it back in May, it was one of the most intense moviegoing experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had, and I&rsquo;m fascinated to return and pick apart why (particularly, but not exclusively) the opening act worked on me so profoundly. I can see it slotting in next to Aronofsky&rsquo;s <em>mother!</em>, Nicolas Winding Refn&rsquo;s <em>The Neon Demon</em>, and Julia Ducournau&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/titane"><em>Titane</em></a> as another film I love, but can put myself through only very infrequently! 🍿</p>

			 <p>Yesterday afternoon, I was walking into town to meet up with my sister for the first time in months, and to see a movie. About 300m from my front door I rolled my ankle <strong>hard</strong> in a pothole — and I mean, I <em>heard</em> that sucker go as I collapsed.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d seen this piece — Business Insider: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-dead-instagram-tiktok-bereal-replaced-group-chats-messaging-2023-8">&lsquo;Social Media is Dead&rsquo;</a> — doing the rounds recently. Essentially, it argues that there&rsquo;s a move underway from broadcast-style social media, towards smaller, closed-group socialising. Since the main feed has become a place for celebrities, influencers, and brands, it has come to feel less and less like a place for regular people to post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture in general has kept a lot of people from showing up because they don&rsquo;t think their life is aesthetic, or they don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re selling anything, so why would they post on social media?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rings true. The aspect that&rsquo;s less-discussed is the extent to which the &lsquo;new&rsquo;, less open mode of social sharing is still taking place on some of the same apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s this sublayer of Instagram that&rsquo;s much more true to what the app once was, but it is just not viewable to the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the decline in public posting from regular users means very little to the companies who own the platforms, because &lsquo;while sharing has tailed off, consuming content hasn&rsquo;t slowed&rsquo;. Meta doesn&rsquo;t really care how much or how little you post, as long as your engagement time stays high. Whether or not you publish your own content, if you&rsquo;re still seeing others', you&rsquo;re still seeing adverts.</p>
<p>The existential threat to these platforms comes when folks get what they want from their smaller, closed groups, and decide on a media diet that doesn&rsquo;t include corporations and famous people. The mental leap away from viewing mainstream social media as &lsquo;social&rsquo;, and towards viewing it as &lsquo;media&rsquo; is a useful one. If the main feed isn&rsquo;t a place to share anymore, it&rsquo;s just another source of entertainment, interspersed with a lot of adverts.</p>

<p>Last night I went to see <a href="https://boxd.it/xX9c"><em>Passages</em> (2023)</a>, a beautifully-shot love triangle tragedy set in Paris. The mechanism of the film is essentially the central character making a series of selfish, ego-driven decisions (or, more accurately, acting on his own desires without much consideration). Those around him — and principally those with whom he&rsquo;s romantically involved — are seen struggling with the profound repercussions. As the third act arrives, you&rsquo;re desperate for other characters to finally draw a line, and call him out. Judging from overheard conversation during the credits, some people in the audience struggled with the protagonist&rsquo;s lack of development. It&rsquo;s certainly frustrating, but I found it to be an accurate portrayal of narcissism: people like Tomas (Franz Rogowski) rarely change, and certainly not overnight. The point in the film at which his claims to have done so are disbelieved, brings genuine catharsis.</p>
<p>Ben Whishaw is subtle and tender as Tomas&rsquo;s husband, and Adèle Exarchopoulos is characteristically soulful. These two are the film&rsquo;s principal loci of empathy, your admiration and sympathy increasing as you become evermore infuriated by Tomas.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Looking for something a little less emotionally fraught, I came home and streamed Céline Devaux&rsquo;s feature debut, <a href="https://boxd.it/yQnS"><em>Tout le monde aime Jeanne</em> (2022)</a> — a light, mature romantic comedy that also touches on loss and depression. The most obviously unique touch is the insertion of kinetic and characterful hand-drawn illustrations (also by Devaux), which certainly make the eponymous protagonist&rsquo;s anxious internal monologue more palatable. I was also taken by the choice to saturate the whole film with bold, rich colour. It somehow served to ground the characters in a vibrant, safe-seeming world, even whilst they struggle. As Laurent Lafitte&rsquo;s Jean says at one point, ‘anxiety is more difficult in beautiful settings’. 🍿</p>

<p>Last night I was present to watch <a href="https://www.chrisfarren.com/">Chris Farren</a> demolish the hottest, sweatiest room in Oxford. The set list, heavy on (excellent) latest album <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1683023812"><em>Doom Singer</em></a>, was raucous and played at 110% volume. Adorned with some humour and vibrant projections, at heart this was the purest rock spectacle available in the city on a Monday night.

			 <p>On last week&rsquo;s episode of <em>The Vergecast</em>, host Nilay Patel <a href="https://youtu.be/DzZ_tQhRVvk?t=3320">requested that listeners send photos of their childhood computer rooms</a>. A photo of me from c. 1992 sprang to mind, so I sent it in. I did not, however, expect to get brutally roasted in the caption.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aside from the weird sartorial decisions, there are a couple of elements of this photo that I like. I&rsquo;m playing <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, which I think puts this somewhere between Christmas 1992 — when I got my Mega Drive — and summer 1993, when we moved out of this house. I remember a good number of the Atari ST games in that box of floppy discs. It&rsquo;s fitting that <em>Lemmings</em> is at the front though, because that was my mum&rsquo;s one and only gaming obsession until <em>Candy Crush</em> some three decades later. I also like the oversized game boxes on the shelf above, which would have held a couple of floppies and an instruction manual, but bigger meant more shelf space. In particular I remember loving that <em>Simpsons</em> game that is right in front of me. And finally, as if this photo wasn&rsquo;t 90s enough, check out the pair of phone books!</p>

			 <p>If chess isn&rsquo;t your thing (yet), you would be forgiven for thinking that chess is chess. But even for games played by the normal rules of chess, there’s a huge variety of time controls that have dramatic impacts on play. You can, of course, play without any time limit, free to leave <em>days</em> between moves if you wish. Games at the FIDE World Cup — which is in its final stages at the moment — are played with 90 minutes on each player’s clock for the first 40 moves, and an additional 30 minutes added after move 40. Also, 30 seconds are added per move. This is a version of the classical chess format, which has endured throughout the game’s long history. But other time controls have gained popularity, perhaps particularly since the advent of online chess. There is Rapid chess, where players might start with anything from 60 minutes to 10 minutes on the clock; Blitz, where clocks start with five or even three minutes, and sometimes two seconds might be added per move; and Bullet, where games can start with as little as 30 seconds on the clock!</p>
<p>But those are just the chess formats that use the normal rules. There are also numerous variations that tweak the way the game itself is played. For example, there is Chess960, wherein the order of pieces on each player’s home rank is randomised; Crazyhouse, in which pieces you capture can be redeployed on your side; and 4 Player Chess, in which… there are four players, and four sets of pieces on one (larger) board. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant">chess variants</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There has also been an explosion in the number and variety of chess video games, many of which feature fun spins on the game. See, as just two examples, <a href="https://shotgun-king.com/"><em>Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</em></a>, and Zach Gage’s <a href="http://reallybadchess.com/"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>.</p>
<p>I mention <strong>all of this</strong> because I recently had an idea for a new variation, which I’m calling Meteorite Chess. The game uses the usual setup of chess pieces, and proceeds as a normal game of chess. The twist is that at set intervals (ie. every three or five moves) one square on the board becomes highlighted, and after the subsequent moves, that square is hit by a meteorite. I can see there being two versions of the game: Meteorite &amp; Meteorite Oblivion. In the latter version, when the meteorite hits the highlighted square, any piece on that square is destroyed, and removed from the board. This is the simpler version of the game, but it still requires both players to adapt their play to accommodate squares which become temporarily hazardous. The game design trick would be in making sure that the squares were selected in a fair way. For example, no squares on the 1, 2, 7, or 8 ranks should probably be targeted at the beginning of the game. Perhaps they become eligible to be meteor struck after 30 moves, incentivising players to develop their pieces earlier. The fun of the game would be to embrace its randomness, but there could also be tweaks to guard against the feeling of unfairness — eg. a setting to provide two moves’ worth of warning before a meteor strikes.</p>
<p>In the non-Oblivion version of the game, things get a little trickier, and perhaps a little more interesting. Here, instead of destroying the piece on the targeted square, the meteorite <em>devolves</em> it to a lesser piece. So, a struck queen becomes a rook; a rook becomes a knight or bishop; a bishop becomes a pawn; and a struck pawn is destroyed. In the majority of instances, this would still prove an incentive for players to avoid the targeted square, <em>but</em> it would give rise to fascinating board states where it might prove beneficial for a player to deliberately move a rook onto the highlighted square, because devolving it into a knight would provide a positional advantage! Again, there are options here to tweak the rules to make things more or less punishing: perhaps a setting that includes some devolving meteorites, and some that outright destroy, as well as the option to either indicate which type of meteorite is coming, or not. Heck, maybe there could even be <em>evolving</em> meteorites, which would increase struck pieces: knight to rook; rook to Queen etc.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2022/04/21/idea-for-a.html">I’ve said here before</a>, I’m not a game designer. But if anyone reading this would like to make use of this idea, feel free! ♟️</p>

<p>Now re-watching the final five episodes of <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> s4, and then I’ll feel properly ready! ✨</p>

			 <p>Last night’s <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-blue-jays/2023/08/13/717012/final/wrap">loss to the Blue Jays</a> had me wondering something: why does it feel like the 2023 Cubs rarely manage to close out a series sweep, and why does it feel like they always falter on Sunday?</p>
<p>I quickly tallied it up. So far this season, the Cubs have played 20 regular season games on a Sunday, and won five of them: a winning percentage of .250</p>
<p>Their winning percentage for the season as a whole currently stands at .517 — more than double! What is it about Sundays? ⚾️</p>

After reading this piece, I&rsquo;m tempted to check out the <em>Rare Replay</em> compilation of 30 games, which they released for the company&rsquo;s 30th anniversary.

			 <p>Nice to see that Jason Heyward&rsquo;s recent success in LA has warranted a piece in the <em>NY Times</em>. He was <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/31/over-the-last.html">one of my favourite players</a> to watch, particularly in the early years of his contract with the Cubs, and it&rsquo;s a delight to see him having a season worth noting. The article starts with an unnecessarily pointed dig at Heyward&rsquo;s former club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he can still help a team, which is more than the Chicago Cubs seemed to think when they decided to cut ties with him last August</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as the piece goes on, it does lay out the case for his having been let go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Heyward’s O.P.S. dropped to career lows in consecutive seasons — .627 in 2021 and .556 in 2022 — it was evident that his time there was done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s kind of the point of the piece: Heyward&rsquo;s 2023 season to date has been an unexpected upswing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heyward’s on-base plus slugging percentage (.797) is his highest over a full season since 2015. He has produced the best isolated power (.216), home run percentage (4.2 percent) and walk rate (11.5 percent) of his career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not mentioned are the struggles that have been experienced by Heyward&rsquo;s replacement in Chicago: Seiya Suzuki, whose workload has recently been reduced to give him space to work on his plate approach. There was, however, one piece that stung: Heyward&rsquo;s admission that “The toughest thing for me was not trying to win every day”. The Cubs' post-World Series decline, and quick collapse into a rebuild, are much discussed. It pained me a little to hear that Heyward shared fans' impatience with the front office&rsquo;s strategy. ⚾️</p>

			 <p>Today I sent the final newsletter issue of this summer&rsquo;s <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">Sipped Ink</a> read-along, bringing to a close six weeks of enjoying Barbara Kingsolver&rsquo;s fantastic novel <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780571376490"><em>Demon Copperhead</em></a> (2022). As always with this project, I come away from it feeling both energised by the community — it&rsquo;s great to have carved out a discrete space to discuss books — and a little drained. I was better about my own schedule this year than I have been in the past, when it was too common that the weekend arrived with me still having all the reading to do, let alone the note-taking and newsletter writing. For the most part I stayed on top of it this year, having been better about taking notes during the week, which were easier to flesh out on the weekends.</p>
<p>It helped that the novel was so good. I don&rsquo;t do any kind of organised reader feedback, but my instinct is that the best of these read-alongs have been when the book is eminently readable. That might sound obvious, but it&rsquo;s actually counter to the spirit in which I started the whole enterprise. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s understandable that participants feel the most engaged with the easier-to-read titles (<em>The Goldfinch</em>, <em>Great Circle</em>, &amp; <em>Demon Copperhead</em> amongst them), but I initially started the read-along as an accountability mechanism to push me through longer, more challenging works (<em>Infinite Jest</em>, <em>2666</em>). This shouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken for a complaint — I also very much enjoy reading these more popular books — but it makes me wonder what the reception would be amongst current participants if I was to move back towards longer or more complex novels.</p>
<p>Now that the read-along is done, I&rsquo;m flush with the giddy freedom of being able to choose to read whatever I want! There&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781668016138">a new Stephen King</a> on the horizon, but that&rsquo;s three weeks away. Before then, I&rsquo;m hoping to pick up a couple from my <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/toread">&lsquo;Want To Read&rsquo;</a> stack.  📚</p>

			 <p>With two weeks until the debut of <em>Ahsoka</em> on Disney+, my prep is going up a gear. I’ve got twelve episodes of my <em>Rebels</em> re-watch to go, and I also hope to re-watch <em>The Mandalorian</em> ‘Chapter 13: The Jedi’ &amp; <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> ‘Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger’. I might even go back through the first season of <em>Tales of the Jedi</em> shorts. New to me though: I’m just starting EK Johnston’s 2016 novel <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781484782316"><em>Ahsoka</em></a> ✨</p>

<p>As much as A.I. has gotten better at making human-like art, creation is arguably the easiest step in the process of cultural formation. Every day thousands if not millions of people propose new ideas and practices, but only a tiny sliver ever win attention, attract adherents, or take on collective meanings. Ironically, generative A.I. has emerged just as we&rsquo;re already emeshed in a human-created crisis of cultural overproduction. Most human-created art today fails to take on social value.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve just finished Barbara Kingsolver&rsquo;s superb novel <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780571376490"><em>Demon Copperhead</em></a> (2022), winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the Women&rsquo;s Prize for Fiction (and yet, curiously not nominated for the Booker Prize). The book was my pick for this summer&rsquo;s instalment of my annual read-along project, <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">Sipped Ink</a>, and as such, most of what I have to say about it has made its way into <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv9">the weekly newsletters</a> over the last six weeks. I will say that it&rsquo;s absolutely proven to be one of those novels that I&rsquo;m simultaneously sad to finish and glad to have read. Heartbreaking, deeply empathetic, and told in the voice of one the most endearing narrators I&rsquo;ve encountered in a long while. 📚</p>

			 <p>Another Wes Anderson note for the day, since I just watched <em>The Afterparty</em> s2e4. Say what you will about the specifics of Anderson&rsquo;s filmmaking style, but imagine having crafted a bespoke look and tone unique enough to be parodied. Other episodes of <em>The Afterparty</em> have co-opted the styles of whole eras (regency period), and genres (romcom; noir; heist), but s4e2 is borrowing solely from Anderson. How many other filmmakers could you do this for and expect wide recognition from the audience of a half hour comedy? Hitchcock? Miyazaki? Tarantino maybe? Even then, I think it would read to many as a broader adoption of the genres in which they operate. 🍿📺</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ever since I saw <em>Asteroid City</em> a few weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve been pondering a re-watch of Wes Anderson&rsquo;s whole back catalogue. Reading this <a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2023/07/26/movies-watched-june-2023/">piece by Khoi Vinh</a> has suggested a new frame through which to do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anderson is a child at heart, of course, and that shows up countless times in his films, whether it’s in his scripts or his stage dressing or his picture book-like cinematography. However, the flip side of this youthful empathy is that Anderson is essentially lost when it comes to adult characters and, by extension, stories about adults. For me, this is the weakness that sabotages films like <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em> and the abysmal <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>, which are populated with nonsensical, schematized characters that talk at one another but never truly interact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My personal ranking of Anderson&rsquo;s movies, as it stands right now, looks like this:</p>
<p>1 — <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em><br>
2 — <em>Asteroid City</em><br>
3 — <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em><br>
4 — <em>The French Dispatch</em><br>
5 — <em>Rushmore</em><br>
6 — <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em><br>
7 — <em>Isle of Dogs</em><br>
8 — <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em><br>
9 — <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em><br>
10 — <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em><br>
11 — <em>Bottle Rocket</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d call <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em> &lsquo;abysmal&rsquo; as Vinh does, but it&rsquo;s one of a few that I&rsquo;ve only seen once. I recall coming away from it very disappointed, and I don&rsquo;t recall now what it was about the film that didn&rsquo;t work for me. I find it interesting that Vinh offers a reason for the relative weakness of both <em>Darjeeling</em> &amp; <em>Life Aquatic</em> that I&rsquo;d not considered before — it might be fun to go back through Anderson&rsquo;s oeuvre with this in mind. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->FWIW<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>Bottle Rocket</em> is another I&rsquo;ve seen only once, and which felt to me like Anderson&rsquo;s <em>Pablo Honey</em>: by no means bad, but containing only glimpses of future greatness.) 🍿</p>

			 <p>This morning the longlist was announced for this year’s Booker Prize, and it is not what I had expected. Perhaps my perspective has been mildly warped by the fact that I’m currently leading <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv9">a group read-along</a> of <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, but — having won both the Pulitzer Prize &amp; the Women’s Prize for Fiction — it felt like Barbara Kingsolver’s novel was a lock for the list. Not only that, I had also anticipated spots amongst the thirteen longlisted novels<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for Eleanor Catton’s <em>Birnam Wood</em>; Catherine Lacy’s <em>Biography of X</em>; Salman Rushdie’s <em>Victory City</em>; and possibly John Banville’s <em>The Singularities</em>. So, all told, I went 0/5 on these predictions!</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f2bfxtxxkaatnca.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The vast majority of these titles are new to me, and I’ve read none of them. I’m not committed to reading the whole list — <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/booker21/">as I did a couple of years ago</a> — but I’ll certainly be looking more closely at a few of these titles in the coming months. 📚</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/19/top-weezer-songs.html">Top 5 Weezer Songs</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/19/top-weezer-songs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-19 17:06:46 &#43;0000">Jul 19, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You can blame this one on <a href="https://brett.seybert.me/2023/07/19/the-best-weezer.html">Brett Seybert</a> — who in turn is blaming it on <a href="https://www.welcometohellworld.com/the-world-has-turned-and-left-me-here/">Luke O’Neil</a> —  but I’ll never pass up a chance to talk Weezer, so here we go.</p>
<p>To begin, let me say that I’m calling this the ‘Buddy Holly’ Memorial List, for two reasons: a) the band’s most famous song<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is too easy a pick; b) it’s unbeatable and I need to cheat to get it on this list somehow. So, just for the record, ‘Buddy Holly’ is a perfect song; the guitar lick at 2:09 would be on my list of top 5 <em>moments</em> in recorded music<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It was my introduction to the band, at age 14, in my high school computer room. The inclusion of the (all-time great) music video on the Windows 95 install CD remains both inexplicable, and sort of magical in my mind. So yes, ‘Buddy Holly’ is not on this list, but… you know 😉</p>
<h3 id="jamie-1993">Jamie (1993)</h3>
<p>Only fitting then, that my first pick<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is the b-side from the ‘Buddy Holly’ single. Holy smokes! Has there ever been a better a-side / b-side CD single?<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Rivers Cuomo is famously prolific, and he has an ear for melody that is second-to-none. I can’t imagine any other artists dashing off a quirky, sweet paean to their band’s lawyer. That opening feedback, the rumbling riff, the heartfelt lyrics, chant-along bridge, croon-along chorus. Weird and wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="you-gave-your-love-to-me-softly-1995">You Gave Your Love to Me Softly (1995)</h3>
<p>Maybe the world’s sweetest 100mph rock ballad? A riff that burns like a lit fuse; another extremely ‘join in at full volume’ chorus; a squealer of a solo… all packed in to less than two minutes. Guaranteed to stick in my head for hours every time I listen to it.</p>
<h3 id="i-just-threw-out-the-love-of-my-dreams-1996">I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams (1996)</h3>
<p>A sad / sweet synth rock masterpiece with one of my absolute favourite vocal melodies. Rachel Haden is flawless, and the bridge, with its duet vocal, is perfect. Add in Rivers somehow shredding a synth, and building the whole thing to a soaring finish. Unbeatable.</p>
<h3 id="sheila-can-do-it-1996--2020">Sheila Can Do It (1996 / 2020)</h3>
<p>How about an album track? And a recent one too, just to prove I’m not an insufferable hipster. For me, this is easily the highlight of Weezer’s last 15 years. That it’s core is essentially unchanged from the 1996 demo version probably says something, but I adore this sing-song vocal melody and playful riff. The bridge and chorus are unimpeachable.</p>
<h3 id="listen-up-2001">Listen Up (2001)</h3>
<p>OK, I’m an insufferable hipster. This is probably one of my favourite songs ever, by any artist, and it’s a demo from the peak of Rivers’ hyper-productive period around the Green album when every b-side and off-cut was better than what was ending up on other bands’ albums. The dynamics of this song are a marvel to me, and perfectly capture a seemingly effortless knack for imbuing simple pop melodies with aching beauty. So few artists can pull off that trick with any consistency: among them Lennon &amp; McCartney; Brian Wilson; Rivers Cuomo. If you don’t happen to have the 2001 demo (or BBC live session) lying around, <a href="https://youtu.be/58oC65i-AcI">here’s a YouTube version</a> — enjoy! 🎵</p>

<p>Is this still true? Do people think of ‘Hash Pipe’ and / or ‘Beverly Hills’ now, when you mention Weezer? If so, shame.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>In the last couple of years, since spinning up a Gaming division, Netflix has quietly built an enviable portfolio of titles available (at no extra charge) to subscribers. I’m writing this today because the long-awaited <em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em> has just been released. The developers behind this title (and the original <em>Oxenfree</em>), <a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/">Night School</a>, were one of the first studios to be acquired by Netflix<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, signalling that they were serious about games. I had a great time with the original game when it was released in 2016, and this week I picked up a month of Netflix mainly to play the sequel. Such is the company’s strategy, presumably: to add to their content release schedule not just new TV shows, but must-play games — two parallel tracks via which to gain (and keep) subscribers.</p>
<p>Consider your options if you want to play the new game right now:</p>
<p>• Steam (PC &amp; Mac): £13.49 (25% launch sale, down from £17.99)<br>
• Nintendo Switch: £13.49 (25% launch sale, down from £17.99)<br>
• PlayStation: £14.24 (25% launch sale, down from £18.99)</p>
<p>Or, you can pick up a month of Netflix (from £4.99), and play the game on your iOS or Android device. Plus, you get to finish season three of <em>Emily in Paris</em>!</p>
<p>Here’s a list of a few other games on the service that I would recommend:</p>
<p>• <em>Terra Nil</em> — city-builder / strategy<br>
• <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> — truly one-of-a-kind point &amp; click adventure<br>
• <em>Immortality</em> — one of my absolute favourite games of 2022<br>
• <em>Spiritfarer</em> — sweet, easygoing management-style game<br>
• <em>Into the Breach</em> — space-set turn-based strategy<br>
• <em>Moonlighter</em> — shop management</p>
<p>And of course, the original <em>Oxenfree</em> — spooky adventure with excellent writing.<br>

<p>I’m not affiliated with Netflix in any way, nor would I accept money from anyone to advertise anything, ever<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But, I do believe in sharing cool things when I find them, and in my experience a lot of people with active Netflix subscriptions don’t know that they could also be playing excellent games without spending an extra penny. 🕹️</p>

			 <p>This afternoon, UK-based tech company <a href="https://nothing.tech">Nothing</a> unveiled their second smartphone: Nothing Phone (2).</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/nothing-phone-2.png" alt=""><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/ad76e1ee2464c3417d4339.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Just as with the original model, I <strong>love</strong> the way this thing looks, and I admire the design ethos behind it: to make tech innovative and fun again, in an age when iteration on established design languages has become the necessary, safe bet for the entrenched market leaders. Oh, it’s also significantly cheaper than an iPhone. Here are the prices at which some flagship devices start:</p>
<p>• iPhone 14: £849<br>
• iPhone 14 Pro: £1,099<br>
• Google Pixel 7: £599<br>
• Google Pixel 7 Pro: £849<br>
• Nothing Phone (2): £579</p>
<p>I have been an iPhone user since 2011’s iPhone 4S. Over that decade-plus — in which I’ve owned four different models — Apple has worked to ensure that the iPhone has increasingly become the centre of a whole ecosystem of devices and services. The upshot of this strategy (and, indeed, the purpose of it), is that there are significant obstacles for anyone considering a move <em>away</em> from Apple’s phone. As an experiment, I thought I’d do some thinking about what it would mean for me to make the switch.</p>
<p>As a starting point, let’s consider each of the apps currently on my iPhone’s Home Screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/home-screen.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a></strong> — no Android version is available, but I’m sure there are plenty of calendar apps that would make a fine substitute. However, I would then need to figure out what calendar apps to use on iPad and Mac. At present Fantastical is syncing the iCloud calendars associated with my Apple ID, so I might even need to find a new solution for that.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong> — not a problem; I’m sure there are good Android weather apps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></strong> — there actually <em>is</em> an Android version of Apple’s music service, so I wouldn’t need to make a switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a></strong> — this one’s easy, as there’s an Android version.</p>
<p><strong>Reminders</strong> — again, there are certainly acceptable substitutes for this in the Play Store, <em>but</em> one of my main uses of Reminders is for shopping lists shared with my partner. It works seamlessly because our Apple IDs are associated as a family. Getting the same functionality elsewhere would be relatively easy, but would require asking my partner to download a different app — annoying.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></strong> — no Android version is available, and that’s a significant issue. I’ve used Cultured Code’s task manager to pretty much run my life since January 2010<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It’s an essential part of how I think about organising things, and I use it everywhere: Mac, iPad, &amp; Apple Watch, but <em>primarily</em> iPhone. Moving away from it would be tricky. My second choice — OmniFocus — also doesn’t have an Android version. I’d have to resort to something like Todoist, which would also incur a paid subscription (unlike Things).</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong> — another strong argument for iCloud’s flawless syncing between devices. I’ve been using these things long enough to remember when every photo I took on my phone <em>didn’t</em> automatically appear on all my other devices. But I’m absolutely spoiled by it now, and I don’t want to go back to the days of using middle-man services (eg. syncing to Google Photos, and bridging that to iCloud?) to make sure everything’s available everywhere.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://hey.com">HEY</a></strong> — another easy one: there’s an Android version of my email client.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> — ah, the <a href="https://youtu.be/BuaKzm7Kq9Q">blue bubble vs green bubble</a> dilemma! Amongst friends and family, iMessage is by far my most commonly used messaging platform. Yes, between WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, &amp; SMS, there are plenty of other options, but the inconvenience of a move away from iMessage isn’t to be underestimated.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://thebrowser.company/">Arc</a></strong> — not a huge loss at present, and perhaps The Browser Company will eventually bring this to Android.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a></strong> — another cross-platform win: an Android version of this journalling app is available.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a></strong> — there’s no Android version of my preferred Mastodon client, and indeed the options look very limited. I’d probably have to switch back to the official app, which is fine, but not a patch on Ivory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://getmatter.com">Matter</a></strong> — my read-it-later service of choice doesn’t have an Android app, so I’d have to switch away from it to an alternative, like Instapaper, Pocket, or Readwise. I don’t do a lot of the actual <em>reading</em> on iPhone though<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, so perhaps I could figure out an alternative method of saving items into Matter on the phone, one option being via email.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a></strong> — a first class Android version of this blogging application is available!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://marcosatanaka.com/">MusicBox</a></strong> — Marcos Tanaka’s music tracking app has become an important part of my listening experience. The fact that no Android version is available would put a major kink in my daily work towards compiling my <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/thelists">end of year list</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a></strong> — Similar to Matter (above), my feed-reader of choice (since 2009) is also not available on Android. Again, most of the actual reading gets done elsewhere (iPad &amp; Mac), but I’m not discounting the annoyance of having one device missing from that setup.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sonos.com">Sonos</a></strong> — no issues here: the controller for my home audio system is available on Android.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://threads.net">Threads</a></strong> — Meta’s new microblogging platform is by no means an essential part of my digital life, and surely headed to Android in the near future<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong> — I like Safari’s privacy-first approach, but I don’t use any of its syncing features (largely because I use Arc as my browser of choice on Mac). Switching to Firefox or something similar on Android wouldn’t be a major pain point.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a></strong> — luckily my preferred password manager is available everywhere, otherwise this would have been a deal-breaker.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a></strong> — I’m not married to one particular note-taking application, and I could find something that would work across platforms; perhaps even something with a web / browser version, which would be nice.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a></strong> — this simple scratchpad is an excellent example of a little application that I use all the time, and which relies entirely upon instant iCloud syncing. I <em>could</em> live without it, but I’d prefer not to!</p>
<p>Looking past the first page, the other stumbling blocks that I can foresee are largely tied to Apple’s own software &amp; services.</p>
<p>• I use FaceTime with family, all of whom <em>could</em> be persuaded to use a platform agnostic alternative, but why should they change their setups for me?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• I use Apple Fitness+ quite a bit, and replacements a) tend to be more expensive, &amp; b) won’t integrate perfectly with my Apple Watch.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• Contacts and Wallet both have native Android allegories, but that would mean managing data in both places: eg. adding or updating a contact on both iOS and Android.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• There are a lot of little ecosystem touches that would break if I had a non-Apple phone: eg. using the phone keyboard, and auto-filling passwords on Apple TV (much easier than navigating an onscreen keyboard with a remote); setting alarms (and choosing music for them) on my HomePod. In both cases I <em>could</em> pull out the iPad each time, but it’s not ideal.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• Not a huge deal, but I also have a case, a MagSafe Wallet, and a MagSafe charger, all of which are highly likely to be compatible with the next iPhone, and are all incompatible with non-Apple options</p>
<hr>
<p>In short, switching away from iPhone to an Android device would incur a dozen or so penalties ranging from irksome to genuinely annoying. The penalties for staying <em>with</em> iPhone, of course, are twofold:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• No choice as to which operating system you use: you just have what Apple gives you. <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/">iOS 17</a> looks just fine, and has some neat additions, <em>but</em> it is clearly another iteration (and a relatively modest one) on the same design that has persisted since iOS 7 debuted a <strong>decade</strong> ago. Variety is one of Android’s selling points, and Nothing’s OS (for example) has a distinct look that feels genuinely new.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
• A ~£300 premium on each upgrade. As mentioned, I’ve had four iPhones in 12 years, or an upgrade roughly every three years. If the difference between an iPhone and a perfectly capable Android device is £300 each time, that adds up.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I have mixed feelings about all of this, is that I’m the same person who was, <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html">not so long ago</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, espousing the virtues of not tying oneself into centralised social platforms — of operating independent of any one company’s choices over your experience. And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I’ve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, <em>of course</em> I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple’s ecosystem work together. But I’m not going to pretend there isn’t a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/07/twoway-mirrors-at.html">Two-way Mirrors at the Mall</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/07/twoway-mirrors-at.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-07 13:20:34 &#43;0000">Jul 7, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I forget where now, but one of the most insightful characterisations of centralised social networks that I’ve encountered, is the idea that a few companies tricked everyone into hanging out at the mall. There’s arguably a flaw in the premise of the oft-quoted idea of a singular ‘digital town square for the world’, but if you were to picture a truly <strong>social</strong> space at that magnitude, it likely wouldn’t have billboards strewn throughout it. The conversations wouldn’t be monopolised by attention-seeking celebrities. And you certainly wouldn’t invite weirdly anthropomorphised incarnations of innumerable brands to join the party.</p>
<p>All of these things were normalised over years of Twitter &amp; Instagram’s dominance of the social media sphere. Spaces that were ostensibly for people to share their experiences and have conversations, came to include — and arguably to be characterised by — the contributions of others who had alternative motives: commonly to garner attention, and/or to sell something. Instead of <em>communication</em>, these platforms became about <em>broadcast</em>.</p>
<p>After 24 hours playing with Meta’s new microblogging platform — Threads — I’m struck by the extent to which, for all the tsuris in the social media space of late, this established paradigm persists. The platform <em>only</em> has an algorithmically-generated Home feed at present<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and whilst this will likely change, it currently plays as a very open admission from Meta that this isn’t designed as a purely social platform. Like latter day Twitter before it — and like its visual-first sister platform, Instagram — Threads is <em>already</em> a place where, yes, you <em>can</em> share your experiences, and socialise with friends, <em>but</em> you do so whilst surrounded by people who eagerly want your attention and your money. This is the promise and the peril of the centralised platform: <em><strong>everyone’s here</strong></em> (but that includes the try-hard brands, and the thirsty celebrities). So, yes, it already feels a little icky, and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuW5-eWL34x/">the advertisers aren’t even there yet</a>. But — <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html">as predicted</a> —  the new platform immediately allowed me to reconnected with some folks who never would have made their way to Mastodon. The colossal power of Instagram’s established social graph did its thing, and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuX691ePVBZ/">48 million Threads accounts were activated in the first ~24 hours</a>. By most estimates, that’s something like <em>four times</em> the size of every combined Mastodon instance, on day one!<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether by design or circumstance, Threads’ much-lauded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> integration isn’t available at launch. At present it is very much a walled-garden proudly professing its ambitions of federation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But, overnight, it has become one of the largest entities committed to using the protocol<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and its eventual federation will have consequences for the ActivityPub ecosystem that I don’t think are entirely clear at present. In my experience, reception to the idea on Mastodon has been mixed. Some server admins have pledged to de-federate Threads as soon as it integrates with the protocol; others (including <a href="https://omglol.news/2023/06/28/meta-the-fediverse-and-omg-lol">the admin of my server</a>) have a more balanced view. There have been enough questions floating around, that Mastodon-founder / lead developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gargron">Eugen Rochko</a> published <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/">some notes</a>, seeking to allay fears about Meta’s ability to track Mastodon users, and push adverts to Mastodon servers etc. His conclusion is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been advocating for interoperability between platforms for years. The biggest hurdle to users switching platforms when those platforms become exploitative is the lock-in of the social graph, the fact that switching platforms means abandoning everyone you know and who knows you. The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media, but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers. Which in turn, puts pressure on such platforms to provide better, less exploitative services. This is a clear victory for our cause, hopefully one of many to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst there are many unknowns about how all this plays out, I think there’s a good chance that the advent of Threads will redound to the benefit of the social web writ large. Advocates of open protocols like ActivityPub should be optimistic about the arrival of a platform that is already clearly on a path to mass adoption. Whether it’s in weeks’ or months’ time, there will soon be millions more accounts available to follow, almost certainly including people whose posts you will be interested in, but whom would not otherwise have joined a compatible platform. But the best part is, you won’t need to step foot in the mall to follow them. Whatever the Threads experience ultimately becomes, thanks to ActivityPub integration, the option will exist to follow Threads accounts without having to engage with an algorithmically-generated Home feed full of brands and celebrities, without ever having to see an advert, and without giving the surveillance capitalism vampires any more of your data.</p>
<p>Personally, I intend to keep playing around with Threads for now. Likely as soon as it’s possible, however, I’ll switch to following Threads users via Mastodon. It will be interesting to see how easy or difficult Meta make it for Threads users to find and follow non-Threads sources publishing via ActivityPub. That barrier, whilst it’ll almost certainly be bidirectional, may well involve jumping through some cumbersome hoops not-so-subtly designed to keep people on Meta’s platform. I think I’ll be OK with that. If it leads to a kind of two-way mirror effect, where I can follow Threads users’ posts, but it’s harder for them to find mine… well, that’s arguably a win-win.</p>

			 <p>Hey, are you on Splooter? Did you start a Bomblo account?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Social media in the era of Twitter&rsquo;s (ongoing) collapse is truly wild. Me? I have accounts all over the place: <a href="https://social.lol/@zioibi">Mastodon</a> (as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before), but also Bluesky, Cohost, T2, Post&hellip; and probably more that I&rsquo;m forgetting. There&rsquo;s life out there, to varying degrees, and it&rsquo;s been fun keeping an eye on how things are evolving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always keep my own site; it&rsquo;s too important to the way I feel about the web for me not to have a spot that&rsquo;s all my own, and subject to no on else&rsquo;s decision making. No adverts, no cookies, no analytics, and full control over everything I publish. I&rsquo;d encourage anyone who values what they&rsquo;re posting online to  think about adopting the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> mindset: &lsquo;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But the social web has its place too, and right now I feel a little as though I&rsquo;m still looking for a perfect fit.</p>
<p>• <strong>Twitter</strong> is increasingly a far-right cesspool, and its server architecture seems to be actively on fire.</p>
<p>• My impression of <strong>Bluesky</strong> has been that it seems chock full of people trying desperately to be funny all the time, which can be exhausting.</p>
<p>• I dig my <strong>Mastodon</strong> experience, but it’s super niche: mainly people talking about open-source projects, blogging, and the fediverse.</p>
<p>Today, Meta launched their microblogging platform: <a href="https://threads.net"><strong>Threads</strong></a>, and it feels like it has a genuine chance at mass adoption. Leveraging users' already established Instagram social graph gives it a significant jump start. It&rsquo;s super early, and the v1 released a few hours ago is missing features that may be considered basic (eg. a timeline of accounts you&rsquo;re following; a browser-based interface; hashtags; availability in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EU<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!), but it feels like there&rsquo;s a chance it could provide a place for people to just post about brunch again.</p>
<p>Put another way: a lot of the family, friends, and accounts I previously followed on Twitter were <em>never</em> going to make the jump to Mastodon, but the majority of them already have Instagram accounts, which puts them a click away from Threads. I expect to see a lot of them there fairly soon. If you&rsquo;re also there, <a href="https://threads.net/@zioibi">say hi</a>!</p>

			 <p>Newslettering godfather Craig Mod is currently running a limited time pop-up — <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/165/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>BASIE!BOP!JAMAICA!</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> — chronicling his visits to several jazz kissa<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in northern Japan. As with everything he publishes, the mix of detail-oriented observation, humane context, and thoughtful rumination is pitch perfect. Here&rsquo;s a clipping from the latest issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mizuyama tells me how he listens to records: Twenty times, he says standing in the shadows, sipping his fourth whiskey on the rocks, toking his hand-rolled cigarettes. That’s my minimum. Even if I hate the record, I listen to it twenty times. Really listen. Try to understand it. Try to understand what I don’t like about it if I don’t like it. Try to get, truly, what those musicians were saying.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>He says, Look — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music doesn’t change. The music on the album doesn’t change. <em>You</em> change. So if you don’t like it today, maybe you’ll like it tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The onus, he’s saying, is on the listener to reach across the aisle, to consider maybe <em>they</em> got it wrong, to push and pull on the scope of their taste like wet dough until you at least understand, if not love, the art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also love Mod&rsquo;s photo of Mizuyama Kazutsugu’s kissa, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vu42DJsFF5XtvyidA">Jazz Spot Leaf</a></p>

			 <p>We’re now half way through the year, and it’s tempting to pull together a list of my favourite 2023 records to date&hellip; but I think I’ll save that until the <a href="/thelists">end of year list</a>. Instead, here are my favourite ten album covers from the first six months of the year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="10-superviolet-infinite-spring">10. Superviolet — <em>Infinite Spring</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/superviolet.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure about the typeface here, though it’s not distracting. I just love the skyscape — which reminds me of <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2018/06/21/010000.html">long Icelandic summer sunsets</a> — and the use of the moon as a kind of punctuation mark.</p>
<h3 id="9-mandy-indiana-ive-seen-a-way">9. Mandy, Indiana — <em>I’ve Seen a Way</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/mandy-indiana.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At once busy and static — I like the ways in which the sunlight, and the water, bring life to the squared off forms of the walls.</p>
<h3 id="8-nappy-nina-mourning-due">8. Nappy Nina — <em>Mourning Due</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/nappy-nina.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A little on the nose perhaps, given the artist’s name, but this makes me smile every time I see it. I appreciate the effort put into the elegant execution of a simple visual joke.</p>
<h3 id="7-albert-hammond-jr-melodies-on-hiatus">7. Albert Hammond Jr. — <em>Melodies on Hiatus</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/albert.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve been a sucker for Helvetica for a long, long time, and it hasn&rsquo;t stopped working for me yet. I like the balance of bold feature typeface and an abstract background.</p>
<h3 id="6-militarie-gun-life-under-the-gun">6. Militarie Gun — <em>Life Under the Gun</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/militarie-gun.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I like the painterly qualities of this, and the choice to make it a direct overhead vantage. With the human figures’ shadows, it has something of <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/muse.png">Muse’s <em>Absolution</em></a> (2003) about it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="5-unknown-mortal-orchestra-v">5. Unknown Mortal Orchestra — <em>V</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/umo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I have no idea of the story behind this photo, but the combination of an active, arresting image with the simple rendering of the album’s title works superbly.</p>
<h3 id="4-kelela-raven">4. Kelela — <em>Raven</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/kelela.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Kelela has a history of strikingly posed record covers, but I think this simple black &amp; white composition is perhaps the best yet. You can almost feel the subtle, living motion in it.</p>
<h3 id="3-lia-kohl-the-ceiling-reposes">3. Lia Kohl — <em>The Ceiling Reposes</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/lia-kohl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I love the dark blue on grey, the repeated circular form, the choice to obscure part of the photographed image, and the textured grain effect. The thin, cleaner border really makes it.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-japanese-house-in-the-end-it-always-does">2. The Japanese House — <em>In The End it Always Does</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/the-japanese-house.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A similar colour palette to the Lia Kohl (above), and a similar use of subtle whitespace. The imperfection and texture of the hand-drawn arrow has a wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a> character, and I love everything about the simple type treatment, aligned at the right margin.</p>
<h3 id="1-boygenius-the-record">1. Boygenius — <em>The Record</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/boygenius.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m tipping my cards a little here, but this is one of those album covers that has the magical property of <em>feeling</em> like the record <em>sounds</em>. In a beautifully simple image, it evokes warmth and friendship, whilst manifesting the music’s sense of reaching for something.</p>

			 <p>Last night I rewatched David O Russell’s <em>Amsterdam</em> (2022). It’s the director’s loosest-feeling movie since 2004’s <em>I Heart Huckabees</em>, and I really enjoy the pace at which it moves. There is a gentle, consistent ease with which it trips the traps of its plot, and ushers in one guest star after another. Unlike some mystery movies, which feel as though they’re going out of their way to prove the cleverness of their plot, <em>Amsterdam</em> is content simply to let its central knot unwind at a slow, gentle pull. Instead the focus is on the relationships between the central trio: a little cluster of characters imbued — by Bale, Robbie, &amp; Washington — with just the right level of quirk as to remain endearing throughout the 134 minute run time.</p>
<p>Special mention should be made of Emmanuel Lubezki’s cinematography. His work has dazzled me in the past: the gritty urgency of Alfonso Cuarón’s <em>Children of Men</em> (2006), and the captivating ballet of the same director’s <em>Gravity</em> (2013); the breadth of <em>The Revenant</em> (2015), and the bravura “single-take” work on <em>Birdman</em> (2014) both with Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Here, in <em>Amsterdam</em>, he employs a palette of greens, browns, and oranges that give the whole film a lush richness. In the few scenes in which they are missing, their omission is as shocking as any plot twist. 🍿</p>

			 <p>Today we ventured out to Whitstable and Herne Bay, to breathe sea air, and walk the coast a little<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We had coffee in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffeeblueprint/">Blueprint</a>; walked the cute little back streets; a darting sparrow flew between my legs; we ate fish &amp; chips at a place on the seafront.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I enjoy the difference between the two towns. Whitstable is very much a place where Blueprint — a small batch roastery that is also a tiny bookshop, and stocks a curated collection of Japanese stationery and Blackwing pencils — feels correctly situated. It’s a place of indie bookshops, cute little florists, and artisanal cheesemongers. Herne Bay (only 9km up the road) feels far closer to a traditional English seaside town: greasy spoon cafes, a pier, seagulls making a play for your ice cream cone.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader; always have been. And as someone who <em>loves</em> to read, and who chose to pursue <a href="/essays">degrees in literature</a>, I&rsquo;ve long had mixed feelings about the deliberateness with which I&rsquo;ve found that I need to approach texts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I reflected on this again recently, as I read a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/remembering-robert-gottlieb-editor-extraordinaire">profile of the late Robert Gottlieb</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gottlieb was a showoff, but not of the athletic sort. When he was in high school, he read “War and Peace” in “a single marathon fourteen-hour session.” As an undergraduate, at Columbia, he read Proust: “seven volumes, seven days.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking the latter of those first, the task of making one&rsquo;s way through <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> in a week, means reading about 181,000 words per day, for seven days straight. That pace is <em>way</em> beyond my reach, even for a single day! I once read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> in one day: it&rsquo;s 73,404 words, and left little time for anything else.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s turning to the <em>War and Peace</em> claim that really makes me question whether this story about Gottlieb is apocryphal. Tolstoy&rsquo;s opus is 587,287 words. To read it in a 14 hour sitting as claimed, you&rsquo;d have to go at a little under 42,000 words per hour, or 700 words per minute, non-stop, for 840 minutes.</p>
<p>It brought to mind that quote, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/08/speed-reading/">usually attributed to Woody Allen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took a speed-reading course and read <em>War and Peace</em> in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst searching for that, I found a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/opinion/l-war-and-peace-in-20-minutes-if-you-care-what-it-says-read-449395.html">1995 letter to the Editor of the NY Times</a>, from communications consultant Dr Phyllis Mindell, in which she decries the practice of &lsquo;speed reading&rsquo;. Here are a couple of sections that chimed for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study after study demonstrates that although people can skim at extremely high rates (as much as 100,000 words a minute), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they gain substantially no comprehension<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly my experience: fly through the text and I end up with no significant understanding of it. Perhaps because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[F]ailure must result from any method that assumes that reading is primarily a visual task<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that one can &ldquo;take in whole pages at a single glance,&rdquo; [&hellip;] or that the approach to reading remains independent of the content of the material to be read or the purposes of reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading is a practice of comprehension, conducted only at first with the eyes, and then primarily with that miraculous organ directly behind them. The letter quotes a wonderful phrasing of this task, by Stanley Elkin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most trenchant critiques of &ldquo;speed reading&rdquo; emerge, directly or indirectly, from the strongest readers. The writer Stanley Elkin, for example, called reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;fine, precise, detailed work, the infinitely small motor managements of diamond cutters and safecrackers that we do in our heads.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as people who think they&rsquo;re multi-tasking are more likely doing several things poorly, I remain convinced that &lsquo;speed readers&rsquo; are actually just looking at patterns, and not engaged in the act of comprehension that I understand reading to be. 📚<br>

			 <p>In 2014, I started a summer read-along project as a way to (essentially) peer pressure myself into finally completing David Foster Wallace’s giant-sized novel <em>Infinite Jest</em> (1996). I assembled a small group of like-minded readers, and we had a good time reading the book together and sharing our thoughts. Each weekend I sent out an email newsletter, with notes on the week’s reading.</p>
<p>The read-along has now become an annual summer tradition: a growing group of readers take on a lengthy novel together, and I send out a newsletter each Sunday discussing our progress. So far we’ve read eight novels together, and you can browse the <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">archive of those newsletters right here</a>.</p>
<p>The time has now come to start the ball rolling on this summer’s read-along, which I’ll be running between <strong>2 Jul – 13 Aug 2023</strong>. When it came to choosing a novel this year, I did a lot of digging around the dark corners of back alley bookshops, browsing the fat, dusty spines of long-forgotten esoteric tomes… and then I chose the novel that won <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/barbara-kingsolver">the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</a>: Barbara Kingsolver’s <em>Demon Copperhead</em> (2022).</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/4df69f5bca.png" alt="A banner announcing that volume nine of the Sipped Ink read-along will begin on 2 July 2023, and cover Barbara Kingsolver’s novel Demon Copperhead."></p>
<p>This transplanting of Dickens’ <em>David Copperfield</em> (1850) to modern-day Virginia has been called ‘a masterpiece in storytelling’ and ‘a once-in-a-generation novel that breaks and mends your heart in the way only the best fiction can’. Sounds pretty good, right?</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about the novel, you could take a look at <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/product/9780571376483-demon-copperhead/">the publisher’s website</a>. As-and-when you’re excited to sign up for this summer’s read-along, <a href="mailto:readalong@zioibi.com?subject=Sign%20me%20up%20for%20Sipped%20Ink%20vol%209&amp;body=Adam%2C%20count%20me%20in%20for%20reading%20Demon%20Copperhead.%20">click right here</a> and send the resulting email.</p>
<p>As always, the read-along itself is completely free; the only thing you’ll need is a copy of the book. If you would like to order the paperback, one great option is Bookshop.org — and if you use <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/7952/9780571376483">this link right here</a> I’ll get a little commission, at no extra cost to you!</p>
<p>At 546 pages, it’s the lowest page count for a read-along novel yet, <em>but</em> the good folks at Faber have chosen a font size for the paperback that’s a little on the small side, so I think — in terms of word count — it’s probably similar to <em>Great Circle</em>, or even Murakami’s <em>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</em>, which we read together in 2015.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send out an introductory email to subscribers on <strong>Sun 2 Jul</strong>, and the following weekend an email will arrive on <strong>Sun 9 Jul</strong>, discussing the first 91 pages of the novel. We’ll be reading at about that pace for six weeks, wrapping up on <strong>Sun 13 Aug</strong>.</p>

			 <p>Since I last posted I&rsquo;ve read a couple of books, both of them a little disappointing, but by no means without merit:</p>
<p>The first was Gabrielle Zevin&rsquo;s much-hyped <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> (2022), which I found both frustratingly divorced from the practical realities of the video game industry (in which it is set), and too eager to undermine its female lead by placing her into romantic relationships with virtually every male character in the novel.</p>
<p>The second was Nell Zink&rsquo;s <em>Avalon</em> (2022), which is dense with ideas, but I found the through-lines of its characters to be too faintly pencilled. It&rsquo;s not so much that I was clamouring for capital C, capital D: Character Development — but in a novel centred around a young woman moving through various upheavals in life circumstance, I felt something a little lacking. Perhaps I just wanted to close the novel with a more definite sense of Bran having learned something about herself. Equally, perhaps that was not Zink&rsquo;s project, and she remains an unquestionably fine, endlessly interesting writer.</p>
<p>I also caught a clutch of good movies; let me bullet point them for you:</p>
<p>• <em>The Fabelmans</em> (2022) — catnip for those cinephiles for whom Spielberg has been a constant presence since childhood</p>
<p>• <em>Women Talking</em> (2022) — masterful in every regard</p>
<p>• <em>Men</em> (2022) — Alex Garland&rsquo;s weirdest, with a truly outré last reel</p>
<p>• <em>Certain Women</em> (2016) — a rewatch of this favourite on International Women&rsquo;s Day; Kelly Reichardt can do no wrong</p>
<p>• <em>Wheel of Fortune &amp; Fantasy</em> (2021) — almost the equal of Ryusuke Hamaguchi&rsquo;s other 2021 film: Oscar-winner, <em>Drive My Car</em></p>
<p>• <em>Empire of Light</em> (2022) — I think I need more room for this one, and may write about it in <a href="/newsletter">the newsletter</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>• <em>A Human Position</em> (2022) — I loved the pace of this, and the pride it takes lingering on both Norway&rsquo;s natural beauty, and its objects of design.</p>

<p>Another month is at an end, and whilst I’m not committed to doing this every time, it did cross my mind to drop a ‘favourite record of February’ post<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This time around, I feel as though I need to split the honours between a pair of albums: Paramore’s <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1646945378"><em>This Is Why</em></a>, and Screaming Females’ <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1644825845"><em>Desire Pathway</em></a>. I’ve listened to each of them a bunch since they came out, and both albums have proven to be hugely welcome returns after 5+ year breaks.</p>
<p>Other notable February releases for me:</p>
<p>Black Belt Eagle Scout — <em>The Land, The Water, The Sky</em><br>
Hope D — <em>Clash of the Substance</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><br>
Kelela — <em>Raven</em><br>
Caroline Polacheck — <em>Desire, I Want to Turn Into You</em><br>
Hania Rani — <em>On Giacometti</em><br>
The WAEVE — <em>The WAEVE</em><br>
WILSN — <em>Those Days Are Over</em><br>
Yo La Tengo — <em>This Stupid World</em><br>
Young Fathers — <em>Heavy Heavy</em></p>

			 <p>I’m an inveterate highlighter, firmly established in the practice of scribbling down and squirrelling away those phrases and ideas I come across that send a certain type of vibration through me. Recently, I was doing some digital housekeeping and found a trove of older notes, many of which contained snippets I hadn’t thought about in many years, but which shone for me once more upon re-discovering them.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun — and possibly of value — to share some of these clippings, and since I’m also starting to think about bringing my newsletter out of hibernation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I figured that might make a good venue. I&rsquo;ll drop a quote / highlight into future issues, with or without my own commentary as seems appropriate.</p>
<p>As a trial, here’s a framing of the practice of blogging that I like, from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hello-by-the-way-whatever_b_17745">this 2011 piece in <em>Huffpost</em></a>, by Nora Ephron:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most delicious things about the profoundly parasitical world of blogs is that you don’t have to have anything much to say. Or you just have to have a little tiny thing to say. You just might want to say hello. I’m here. And by the way. On the other hand. Nevertheless. Did you see this? Whatever. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A blog is sort of like an exhale. What you hope is that whatever you’re saying is true for about as long as you’re saying it. Even if it’s not much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Last night I caught a performance by London-based genre-dismantlers <a href="https://jockstrapmusic.com">Jockstrap</a> at The Bullingdon, on Oxford&rsquo;s Cowley Rd. It&rsquo;s a 400-capacity venue that I&rsquo;ve been to for a few shows, but this was the first time I&rsquo;ve seen it packed. The band&rsquo;s current (sold out) tour, in support of debut album <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1625455552"><em>I Love You Jennifer B</em></a> (2022), is also taking them as far afield as Australia &amp; Japan — a further sign that their frenetic, adventurous sound has struck a nerve.</p>
<p>The set list was probably about as balanced as Jockstrap can get, pulling from both the softer side of their oeuvre — songs like the pretty &amp; sad <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625456136">&lsquo;Glasgow&rsquo;</a>, which Georgia Ellery sings and strums largely solo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — to the down-right unstable (see eg. <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1506237863">&lsquo;Robert&rsquo;</a>). Most tracks, however, are some mix of styles: the band shifting restlessly between vibes and valences (ie. the danceable middle third of single &lsquo;Concrete Over Water&rsquo;, a song that is otherwise something approaching a ballad).</p>
<p>One aspect of the sequencing that I really enjoyed, is the way in which following &lsquo;Concrete Over Water&rsquo; (2022) with <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1506237868">&lsquo;The City&rsquo;</a> (2020) makes the earlier track read as a neat coda to the more recent one.</p>
<p><a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625455889">&lsquo;Angst&rsquo;</a> is a three-minute song on the album that sounds as though it was recorded as a four-minute song, and then had its last quarter compressed into the track&rsquo;s final ~25 seconds. The effect is similar to that of scrubbing through those final moments of audio, and I would have guessed that it would be achieved live by employing a sample. It was a delight to see Ellery sing it, whilst Taylor Skye pitch-shifted her vocal.</p>
<p>The whole performance was admirably tight, and you could tell the spell was working: the crowd unfailingly remained silent throughout the quieter moments, and exploded into motion on the high-energy songs. Personal favourite <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625455895">&lsquo;Debra&rsquo;</a> felt like it landed particularly well.</p>
<p>Finally, what a joy it must be to know you&rsquo;ve got a bona fide banger like <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625456147">&lsquo;50/50&rsquo;</a> in your back pocket to drop as a closer. Even though <a href="https://youtu.be/cd_MFQIh2zE">the (no budget) official video</a> could have been shot at last night&rsquo;s show, it only goes some way to depicting how much harder the song hits in person.<br>

<p>Re-listening to <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em> ahead of the show (and again this morning) I&rsquo;m experiencing a little regret that I didn&rsquo;t find a spot for it on my <a href="/list2022">end of year top 20</a>. It was one of a few records that made a shortlist, but not the final cut. It&rsquo;s testament to Jockstrap that the live show injects even more vitality to these already super-vibrant songs, and has me second guessing myself.</p>

			 <p>Now that we’re getting Game Boy Advance games on Nintendo Switch Online, here’s my wishlist.</p>
<p>First, we need to note that amongst the launch line-up are <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</em>, both of which would have been on my list. As would <em>F-Zero Maximum Velocity</em> &amp; <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, which have been announced as forthcoming. And one more caveat: given that the Switch remake — <em>Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp</em> — now has a new release date (21 Apr), it feels unlikely that the two original games will be added to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NSO<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I guess you never know.</p>
<p>With all that said, here are the top five further additions I’d love to see:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> — <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em><br>
<strong>2</strong> — <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em><br>
<strong>3</strong> — <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em><br>
<strong>4</strong> — <em>Sonic Advance</em><br>

Top of the pile is <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1648671176"><em>A Short Diary</em></a> from Sebastian Rochford &amp; Kit Downes — a subtle, delicate set of percussion &amp; piano-led jazz that I&rsquo;ve had on repeat since it came out on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ECM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of weeks ago. Others I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, in no particular order:</p>
<p>Fireworks — <em>Higher Lonely Power</em><br>
Liela Moss — <em>Internal Working Model</em><br>
Jadu Heart — <em>Derealised</em><br>
Jonah Yano — <em>Portrait of a Dog</em><br>

			 <p>Over the last five seasons, for pretty much every game of baseball that I watched, you&rsquo;d find me wearing a replica <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heywaja01.shtml">Jason Heyward</a> jersey. A <em>lot</em> has been written during that period about the wisdom of Heyward&rsquo;s contract with the Cubs (eight years; $184M), and I don&rsquo;t aim to add to it here. At his best, I always found Heyward a magnetic player to watch. His <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/heyward-s-walk-off-grand-slam-c2126932683?q=BatterId%20%3D%20%5B518792%5D%20AND%20HitResult%20%3D%20%5B%22Home%20Run%22%5D%20Order%20By%20Timestamp%20DESC&amp;cp=MIXED&amp;p=1">game-winning walk-off grand slam</a> against the Phillies in 2018 is something I&rsquo;ll never forget, and there are plenty of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/jason-heyward-homers-6-on-a-fly-ball-to-left-field?q=BatterId%20%3D%20%5B518792%5D%20AND%20HitResult%20%3D%20%5B%22Home%20Run%22%5D%20Order%20By%20Timestamp%20DESC&amp;cp=MIXED&amp;p=0">other highlights</a>. Not to mention the consistently <a href="https://youtu.be/NKxkwI8-wA8">stunning defence</a> that won him no fewer than five gold gloves, and the fact that he seems to be a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/jason-heyward-named-cubs-robert-clemente-award-nominee">genuinely wonderful person</a> away from the diamond.</p>
<p>The Cubs having released him in November, I&rsquo;m sure <a href="https://youtu.be/d6-3KLVIqKE">going to miss the guy</a> this coming season.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/058e08782b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Heyward&rsquo;s departure sent me shopping for a new jersey. One consideration is longevity: no one wants to drop money on a shirt, only to find the player has been traded away from the club a season later. Following that logic, I might have picked up a jersey that read <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/suzukse01.shtml">SUZUKI</a> #27<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (signed through 2026), or even <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/swansda01.shtml">SWANSON</a> #7<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (signed through 2029). In the end, however, I went a different direction. When you happen to share a surname with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/woodke02.shtml">one of your team&rsquo;s legends</a>, sometimes you have to lean into it!</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/d3a3e7ce12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I could not be more excited to wear this <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-cardinals/2023/06/25/717623">at London Stadium this summer</a>, rooting for the Cubbies in person, for the first time!</p>

<p>It’s a curse of our current vantage point, that we feel compelled now to assess works of speculative fiction published immediately <em>before</em> the onset of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->COVID<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-19 pandemic, against our lived experiences these past three years. Tim Maughan’s 2019 novel, <em>Infinite Detail</em>, is concerned with a very different worldwide disaster: one which is &lsquo;viral&rsquo; in a digital sense, rather than in a biological / epidemiological one. Nevertheless, the allegory bears fruit by virtue of the extent to which Maughan is interested in the secondary effects of isolation, scarcity, and precarity. Separated into ‘Before’ and ‘After’ chapters, the novel&rsquo;s fulcrum is an act of technological terrorism that results in the complete collapse of the internet. Maughan — who has written for outlets including the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BBC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <em>New Scientist</em>, and <em>Vice</em> on ‘cities, class, culture, technology’ etc. — uses this pivot as means to explore both our current (over-)dependence on networked systems, and the potential shape of consequences to their collapse. For those of us who, not long ago, queued to get into supermarkets, where a mix of fear, greed, and straining infrastructure had already rendered shelves mostly empty, there are passages here that have grown eerily familiar in the years since the novel&rsquo;s publication.</p>
<p>Maughan draws characters well enough, incorporating voices recognisable from the south west of Britain, in which large portions of the novel are set. Things are a little less sharply rendered with respect to the through-lines of characters’ motivations, and the architecture of the novel’s overall plot. The alternating ‘Before’ &amp; ‘After’ chapter headings have the unfortunate effect of casting the technological catastrophe as the narrative’s center point. And when it comes (in the form of a pseudo-manifesto more than half way through the text), it is underwhelming, largely comprising such edgelord bons mots as ‘we let ourselves become nothing more than the content between adverts’ and ‘SkyNet is real, and it wants to sell you shoes made by child slaves’.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, this is Maughan’s point: this is an act of terrorism perpetrated by people who consider it an act of liberation via vandalism, and whom prove shamefully ignorant of the extensive consequences. To his credit — and the novel’s benefit — less focus is spent on the mechanics of the collapse (settling for hand-waving talk of viruses, worms, and floods of junk data) than on how people — and collectives of people — cope. In mining this vein of narrative, Maughan is commendably unromantic, even-handedly exploring the undeniable negatives of commercialised hyper-connectivity, but also the ways in which forced disconnection could be worse. I enjoyed these passages where they occurred, even if I came away wishing that the novel overall had committed to a thesis — something which I found a little lacking.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a side note, there is a thread of <em>Infinite Detail</em> that concerns the digital preservation of a particular location in the form of a temporally-manipulable virtual space. Donning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glasses (‘spex’, in the parlance of the novel), characters are able to virtually explore a recorded time period in the history of the space that they are physically inhabiting. This rekindled my long-held desire for a digital experience akin to attending a piece of <a href="https://www.punchdrunk.com/">Punchdrunk&rsquo;s</a> elaborate, immersive theatre. I found myself repeatedly ruminating on the possibilities represented by The Croft of Maughan&rsquo;s novel as setting for a non-combat, exploration / mystery video game, following in the footsteps of titles like <a href="https://obradinn.com/"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> (2018)</a> and <a href="http://umurangi.tapiki.io/"><em>Umurangi Generation</em> (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Recommencing the practice of blogging each year, I&rsquo;m often sent back to this book: <em>Nicely Said</em>, by <a href="https://www.nicolefenton.com/">Nicole Fenton</a> &amp; <a href="http://katekieferlee.com/">Kate Kiefer Lee</a>. Originally published in 2014, it&rsquo;s a straight-forward guide to some basic principles of writing non-fiction for public consumption, and has some useful insight into what makes the web a unique medium.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t re-read the whole thing, but I do find it valuable to pull down from the shelf and flick through every once in a while, to recalibrate the extent to which my own &lsquo;online voice&rsquo; has strayed from the path of legibility. I won&rsquo;t say that I follow every piece of the book&rsquo;s advice to the letter, but there are certainly ideas and rules of thumb that have stuck with me over the years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/room-for-everybody/">latest issue of Robin Sloan&rsquo;s newsletter</a>, he points to a page on the website of writer Marcin Wichary, titled <a href="https://shifthappens.site/about-me-and-my-book/">&lsquo;My Book and What It Means to Me&rsquo;</a>, of which Sloan writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s both a beautiful reflection and a compelling invitation, and it’s got me wondering if perhaps every author ought to produce a page of this kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That proved to be the nudge I needed to write about something I&rsquo;ve not discussed here before, and which those of you reading, whom I don&rsquo;t know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IRL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, may not know. Back in 2018 — at the age of 37 — I <em>finally</em> achieved something that had been a goal of mine for pretty much as long as I can remember: I completed the first draft of a novel.</p>
<p>I have wanted to be &lsquo;a writer&rsquo; since childhood. And, whilst my relationship to that concept, that label, and that practice, has complicated over the decades, I still count writing amongst my few ambitions<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by writing as an activity, a state of mind, and a mode of thought; in my experience, nothing is quite like it. No practice is more clarifying than sitting down to write out one&rsquo;s thoughts on a subject (as I am doing right now). Amongst other things, it forces you into an assessment of each statement&rsquo;s veracity, and allows you to build a path of sense-making, stone-by-stone, at the same time as walking it.</p>
<p>I can also say honestly that there is almost nothing in the world that I love more than stories. Just this Christmas, my father recalled asking me when I was eight years old, why — in my otherwise fastidiously neat room<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> — there were more than half a dozen books littering the windowsill. The reply he received — &ldquo;Those are the ones I&rsquo;m reading at the moment&rdquo; — baffled him, but makes sense to me even now, as someone who has openly confessed my <a href="/litmonogamy">struggles with literary monogamy</a>. Books, film, television, theatre, video games — I have an abiding love of each form, and I&rsquo;ll happily witter on about <a href="/ondaatjesentence">poetics</a>, or <a href="/theroad">cinematography</a>, or <a href="/tendrils013">ludonarrative dissonance</a> at the drop of a hat. <em>But</em>, the deepest-set hook that each of these artistic forms has in me, is that of narrative. I will let slide uninspiring direction, endure poor acting, and wade through all manner of lacklustre gameplay if you have a good story to tell me. Stories, stories, stories. I cannot get enough of them, and I am unashamedly omnivorous about where I get them. I have taken as much pleasure in this regard from films starring Elvis Presley, as I have from some productions of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>All of which has informed a lifelong desire to make a contribution of my own to the great collective pool of stories. That feeling, at the end of 2018, of reaching completion on a draft of a novel, is something I won&rsquo;t soon forget. I have lost count of the number of my abortive previous attempts: projects that failed as early as the outlining stage, and as late as being half written. One of the things I felt when I completed that first draft, was relief at how much that successful project had pulled from those that had flickered out before it. A good number of ideas, characters, and plot threads, surprised me by surviving the early demise of the stories that had been their genesis — reappearing, to my delight, as I progressed with the draft that was ultimately to succeed.</p>
<p>And I use the words &lsquo;succeed&rsquo; and &lsquo;successful&rsquo; advisedly above. To my mind, the fact that that story was taken from start to finish, and exists in a fully readable form, is a success. Shortly after completing that first draft, I made an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EPUB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, and gave it to six people, all of whom were kind enough to read it, and offer a few notes. But that, as the saying goes, was that.</p>
<p>In his excellent craft memoir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing%3A_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft"><em>On Writing</em></a> (2000), Stephen King recommends that, after completing a first draft, the writer puts the manuscript in a drawer for a few months, so as to return to it with relatively fresh eyes when undertaking a second draft. To the best of my recollection, that was my intention in 2019, when I took those notes from early readers. But the months stretched on until they became years. And in that time, though I&rsquo;ve not done much more than peek at the document myself<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, the problems with that first draft multiplied and metastasised in my mind to the point that even the <em>idea</em> of wading back in to try and fix them, felt increasingly daunting, and perhaps futile. Overmatched by the problem, I did not touch the novel in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. That&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> longer than Mr. King recommends, and I am almost certain that if I were to return to it now, I would be doing so not only with fresh eyes, but with a relatively consistent sense of surprise — for better or worse — at what I had put on the page.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve resolved to do just that. Following a four year fallow period, I&rsquo;m going to sharpen my pencil once more, and venture back in to the world of the novel, to see what needs to be done. I anticipate a great many cobwebs, some pretty gnarly, overgrown vines, and perhaps even a partial collapse of architecture I had once considered sturdy. For reasons I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on at this juncture, however, my anxiety over the presumed scale of the task has (largely) given way to something like intrigue. I&rsquo;m genuinely interested to know what I&rsquo;ll find when I pry the lid off this well, and climb down inside.</p>
<p>Let me be clear from the outset: I have no illusions around this novel getting published. I also have no intention of self-publishing it — at least not through what have become the mainstream channels for such pursuits. In truth, I don&rsquo;t yet know what form the outcome of this work might assume. My sole aims at this stage are, first: to bring this story closer to what I consider its finished form; and, second: to make it available for more people to read.</p>
<p>It would be my pleasure if you&rsquo;d tag along with me whilst I hack at the vines. I&rsquo;ll post updates here when I have progress to share. Wish me luck!</p>

			 <p>I know that we&rsquo;re almost a week into 2023, and that the fatigue on &lsquo;end of year&rsquo; wrap-ups is real. <em>But</em>, I only just found out that <a href="https://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> offer one, and I found some of the results interesting / funny.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/d30a41a56d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;m totally puzzled as to what was going on 3-16 Sep that meant I didn&rsquo;t watch a single movie. It would be one thing to have only two weeks in the year where I didn&rsquo;t sit down to a film, but the fact that they&rsquo;re back-to-back like that feels weird.</p>
<p>Also notable: Thursday is my most frequent film-watching weekday because my special lady friend attends a class that evening.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/c1cb095598.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Secondly, my &lsquo;most watched actors&rsquo; has been heavily swayed by the fact that I watched all five <em>Scream</em> movies in 2022. However, the inclusion — <em>at the top</em> — of Ethan Hawke was a surprise. I can only attribute it to the fact that dude works! Those six Hawke flicks were <em>Dead Poets Society</em> (1989); <em>Taking Lives</em> (2004); <em>First Reformed</em> (2017); <em>The Northman</em> (2022); <em>The Black Phone</em> (2021); <em>Raymond &amp; Ray</em> (2022)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/a53b338e9b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, &lsquo;most-watched directors&rsquo; also gets skewed by that re-watch of the <em>Scream</em> franchise, and — in fact — two of the other inclusions here are the result of (re-)watching trilogies. Can you name them? (One should be pretty freaking obvious!)</p>

			 <p>I bounced around a couple of Mastodon instances before I settled into one that I like; right now you can find me at <a href="https://social.lol/@zioibi">social.lol</a>. The instance is run by (Kentucky-based, one man design studio) <a href="https://neatnik.net/">Neatnik</a>, as part of the evolving suite of services under the <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/zioibi">omg.lol</a> banner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying Mastodon principally because the folks on my instance seem like a cool bunch, and (as mentioned <a href="/hny23">a couple of days ago</a>) the platform in general feels increasingly alive with new people — several million signups over the last few weeks. Secondarily, but super important to me, is the fact that Mastodon solves for many of my problems with social media in general. At the top of the list: it&rsquo;s not advertising supported, and (therefore) not algorithmically driven. Unlike centralised, for-profit social platforms, Mastodon doesn&rsquo;t care how much time you spend on it, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to invent tricks to keep you scrolling. Here are a few other touches I appreciate:</p>
<p>• <strong>Hide Social Graph</strong> — maybe my favourite Mastodon feature: it&rsquo;s no one else&rsquo;s concern who follows me, or whom I follow. With the simple tick of a box, glorious privacy.</p>
<p>• <strong>Content Warnings</strong> — the ability to set a click-through message ahead of a post means less chance of accidentally stumbling upon things like movie spoilers or details about <a href="https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/bulls-fall-to-cavs-in-ot-donovan-mitchell-scores-71-points">heartbreaking basketball games</a>.</p>
<p>• <strong>Automated Post Deletion</strong> — I don&rsquo;t post anything to social platforms that I intend should have a shelf-life. I love that I can set my posts to evaporate in 7 days' time.</p>

			 <p>I know, I&rsquo;m not supposed to be here. Back in October, I made somewhat of a big deal out of <a href="/tendrils022">my annual retreat from the internet</a>, saying I&rsquo;d be back at the keyboard in the spring. As I type this, I&rsquo;m sat under an electric blanket, entirely too aware that it&rsquo;s still mid-winter.</p>
<p>The truth is that shortly after my self-imposed absence kicked in, the internet became entirely too interesting to ignore. Sure, I took a couple of months off from posting here, and sending newsletters — but the sale of Twitter, and the upheaval subsequent thereto, has kept me glued to my screen. It&rsquo;s been riveting.</p>
<p>My own history with Twitter is complicated. There was a time I found it an enormously enjoyable place to be, and a valuable tool for both socialising and discovery. As with almost all centralised, advertising-supported social platforms however, the magic fell away over the course of time. In a post published a decade ago this week (!), I complained about <a href="/socialweird">the increasing siloing of content and connection</a>. Then, five years ago, I found myself <a href="/metrics">trying to pinpoint</a> the aspects of the modern social web that didn&rsquo;t sit well with me, whilst <a href="/ontwitter">adopting increasingly torturous postures</a> to justify my continued use. Eventually I came to use Twitter, and most other centralised platforms, almost entirely as <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">vectors for sharing content I controlled myself</a>.</p>
<p>For me, there is certainly an element of sadness in seeing Twitter further debased and mismanaged in the hands of its new ownership. But, it has also proven liberating: for one thing, decentralised platforms have begun to see an uptick in usage I previously thought surpassingly unlikely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed a reappraisal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> protocol</a>: a recognition of its simplicity, and its centrality to the original forms of socialising on the web. Alongside this, there have been renewed, spirited calls for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">a return to blogging</a>, and efforts to re-form communities around individual, personal sites. All of this has made the social internet feel more exciting to me in the last couple of months than it has in many years.</p>
<p>And so, since no day on the calendar represents a cleaner slate than New Year&rsquo;s Day, I&rsquo;m spinning the site back up early this year. You can bookmark <a href="https://zioibi.com">zioibi.com</a> or grab the <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/feed.xml"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feed here</a>.</p>
<p>As has become traditional, I&rsquo;ve added a few choice posts from 2022 to the <a href="/highlights">index of highlights</a>. There&rsquo;s also an updated <a href="/about">About</a> page, and the 2022 edition of my annual, end-of-year <a href="/thelists">favourite albums list</a> — at ~6,000 words, I think this is the longest one yet!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-ingrid-andress--good-person">20. Ingrid Andress — <em>Good Person</em></h3>
<p>I don’t consider myself a country music fan. Perhaps the first significant crack in that wall was falling pretty hard for Kacey Musgraves’ <em>Golden Hour</em> in 2018, and there have certainly been country-inflected pop albums that have worked for me before and since. However, Ingrid Andress is perhaps the first artist to make my list whom it would be fair to label ‘country‘, and yet even here I suspect that there are enough pop and folk elements, that hardcore genre sticklers wouldn&rsquo;t consider it a purebred country record. Regardless, across a dozen simple compositions, Andress proves herself to be not only in possession of a rich, warm voice but also an impressive ear for memorable melodies. Title track and opener ‘Good Person‘ is a heart-on-sleeve paean to personal character, so earnest that it feels astounding it hasn&rsquo;t been done a thousand times before. Follow-up ‘Yearbook‘ is a masterclass in sweet and sad storytelling. Then ‘Seeing Someone Else‘ is an Olivia Rodrigo-style ‘my ex is with someone who looks like me‘ sing-along, with a fun twist! And, speaking of last year’s List-topper, ‘Pain’ here sure sounds very close to Rodrigo’s ‘Traitor’, but has enough charm of its own so as not to feel entirely derivative.</p>
<p>It’s a surpassingly easy-going and consistent record; I often found myself wandering around humming ‘Feels Like This’ or ‘How Honest Do You Want Me To Be?’ until I had to put the album on for one more spin. This clarity and quality of songwriting is always going to work for me, whether you call it pop, country, or anything else.</p>
<h3 id="19-tallies--patina">19. Tallies — <em>Patina</em></h3>
<p>Toronto four-piece Tallies were new to me this year, and had I encountered this record divorced of context I likely would have suspected it was from somewhere in the early or mid-90s. (The cover even seems to be a nod to 4AD output from the era, like Pixies, Belly, &amp; Red House Painters.) Lightly-treated vocals across beds of layered, fuzzed guitars — it has the feel of vintage dream-pop, a sound that either had a resurgence this year, or which I became enamoured of in a new way. I have had flirtations before with artists like Beach House and Grizzly Bear, but <em>Patina</em> perhaps brings something to the mix that was missing for me: a sense of lightness, and maybe a poppier tint.</p>
<p>At 34 minutes and 9 tracks, there isn’t a great deal of variety here, but (this being their sophomore LP) Tallies have brought together a set of tracks that cohere as a sustained mood, into which it is a pleasure to immerse oneself. The compositions are restrained, relying more upon the shifting, shimmering production than on quiet-loud dynamics, to sustain attention. It’s a remarkably easy record to listen to, and yet — like many of those 90s progenitors — yields fruit when closer attention is paid. I need to go back and check out the debut, and I’ll be interested to see whether Tallies continue in this well-worn groove, or push their envelope on a follow-up.</p>
<h3 id="18-nilüfer-yanya--painless">18. Nilüfer Yanya — <em>PAINLESS</em></h3>
<p>Nilüfer Yanya has a few releases under her belt at this point — including a pair of EPs, and a 2019 debut LP: <em>Miss Universe</em> — all of which flew under my (obviously poorly-tuned) radar. When the buzz around <em>PAINLESS</em> started to build this spring, it didn&rsquo;t take very long for me to key into a record comprising a lot of sounds I have a history with. It&rsquo;s an intriguing mix: downtempo, post-grunge-adjacent arrangements with the addition of prettier, poppier accents; a quasi-shoegazey gauze over the production, and a low key vocal style that ranges down to a rich bass. Whilst this particular fusion feels unique, it did call to mind the sonic worlds of artists like <a href="/list2017">Jay Som</a> &amp; <a href="/list2021">Bachelor</a>, who have made top-five appearances on these lists in recent years.</p>
<p>Opener ‘the dealer’ rides a neat mix of strummed guitar and busy drums, with a bass-line that comes in to ground the choruses. It’s moody and assuredly composed, as is the next track: ‘L/R’, with its slower tempo and shifting vocal. ‘stabilise’ is one of the best Bloc Party songs of the year, and closer ‘anotherlife’ leaves the record on one of its sunnier notes.</p>
<p>Yanya ends 2022 with an appearance on Nigel Godrich’s <a href="https://youtu.be/bzfbGDUrpjw"><em>From the Basement</em></a> series. It&rsquo;s a warm and intimate set that showcases the strong construction of these songs, and a welcome companion piece to a headphones-first record that has stuck with me throughout most of the year.</p>
<h3 id="17-bloc-party--alpha-games">17. Bloc Party — <em>Alpha Games</em></h3>
<p>Each time Arcade Fire put out a record, I go through a cycle wherein at first I feel underwhelmed, and then — after spending more time with the album — I come to better appreciate it. That pattern didn’t hold for me with this year’s Arcade Fire release (<em>WE</em>, which you won&rsquo;t find on this list), but instead, I found myself doing the same dance with another album: the sixth from long-time favourites Bloc Party.</p>
<p>Each previous BP record has made a top-20 spot*, and in fact this is their first to drop outside of the top 10. As alluded to above, however, there was a stretch of several months following <em>Alpha Games’</em> April release in which it wasn&rsquo;t in contention at all. Only my enduring affinity for the band kept me returning to the album long enough for it to charm me.</p>
<p>I think part of this evolving response to the record is rooted in the extent to which the sound of <em>Alpha Games</em> represents a step back, to something closer to the sound of <em>older</em> Bloc Party records. I called 2016&rsquo;s <em>Hymns</em> <a href="/list2016">‘quietly revolutionary’</a>, whilst praising the new textures the band were playing with. The album before that — 2012&rsquo;s <em>Four</em> — also felt like it had adjusted from the sound that had, until then, defined the band: it was more muscular and assertive. <em>Alpha Games</em>, then, was at first confusing given that it sounded to me more like the Bloc Party of 2008, than that of the past decade-plus. The reliance on more complex, syncopated drum sounds is stronger; there is a return to prominence for the guitar, which had taken something of a back-seat on <em>Hymns</em>. However, there is no avoiding the fact that 50% of the band&rsquo;s personnel has changed since they last made music in this vein, and as such the sound is at once familiar and slightly altered.</p>
<p>It was only once I got past the mental stumbling block that all these comparisons represent, that I started to enjoy <em>Alpha Games</em> on its own merits. Then, it really opened up for me, and before long I found myself wondering why I once had a hard time with it. There&rsquo;s a lot to enjoy in the driving rhythms of singles, ‘Traps‘ and ‘The Girls Are Fighting’; the restrained anger of the unhinged ‘Callum is a Snake’, with its borrowed garage drumbeat; and the softer, more upbeat ‘In Situ’. Some of my favourite moments, however, are the quieter ones. ‘Of Things to Come’ is grown from the same tree as one of my Bloc Party favourites: <em>Intimacy</em> closer ‘Ion Square’. And the final pair here — ‘If We Get Caught’ &amp; ‘The Peace Offering’ — bring an otherwise quite frenetic record in for a graceful landing.</p>
<p>Where they go from here, I’m not sure. But, I do know I’ll be eager to go along for the ride.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->* 4th in 2005; 8th in 2007; 3rd in 2008; 4th in 2012; 4th in 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="16-horsegirl--versions-of-modern-performance">16. Horsegirl — <em>Versions of Modern Performance</em></h3>
<p>Here’s another album steeped in a sound from the 90s, but this time the influence is clearly from the likes of The Breeders and Sonic Youth. Indeed, Chicago’s Horsegirl supported Pavement on tour this year — no small feat for a three-piece whose members weren’t born when <em>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em> (1992) helped set the template for a certain strain of slacker indie rock.</p>
<p>On songs like ‘Dirtbag Transformation (Still Dirty)’ and ‘World of Pots and Pans’ the group centres their knack for catchy tunes to shuffle your feet to, possibly with your chin on your chest. Opener ‘Anti-Glory’ and fellow single ‘Option 8’ are more upfront about their gifts of melody, both underpinned by strong percussion. Tracks such as ‘Live and Ski’ make excellent use of the group’s two-vocalists setup, and elsewhere the inclusion of instrumental caesura delights in the tone of guitars fed through warm and fuzzy effects pedals.</p>
<p>The re-emergence of these 90s sounds was notable for me this year. I mentioned Tallies’ reaching back to peak dream-pop; here Horsegirl are pulling from other 4AD artists, as well as those on Matador in the early part of that decade. And we’re not done yet. I don’t know if all this genuinely was part of a larger 90s resurgence, or whether I just got particularly nostalgic in ’22.</p>
<h3 id="15-warpaint--radiate-like-this">15. Warpaint — <em>Radiate Like This</em></h3>
<p>Warpaint missed a spot on my list in 2010 only by virtue of how late I came to their debut: <em>The Fool</em>. I’ve enjoyed albums since then — particularly 2014’s self-titled record — but it was immediately apparent to me that <em>Radiate Like This</em> hits a new level, after a six-year hiatus. The band’s supremely laid-back strain of psychedelic indie rock, refined now to an unmistakable signature sound, is cut here with new touches. A programmed drum line or two, some R&amp;B harmonies here &amp; there, I’ll even allow the steel pan on ‘Melting‘ — normally an instrument I would go out of my way to avoid. Faintly detectable trip-hop and lo-fi influences help refresh Warpaint&rsquo;s ongoing project: a genre-blending exercise that is now more than a decade old. But, even as more prominent artists have begun working in similar borderlands, few have arrived at songs as polished and effortless-seeming as ‘Hard to Tell You’ (which features the lightest touch of 80s synth), or ‘Stevie’ — a potential radio hit if it were forced to dress up and dance to a higher tempo, but which here sounds like Sananda Maitreya on benzodiazepine.</p>
<p>The vocals remain one of the group’s strongest pulls: Kokal, Wayman, &amp; Lindberg’s soft croons weaving amongst one another, perfect partners to the languid, hazy instrumentation. It’s a spell Warpaint have become increasingly adept at casting, and one which feels refined to me on <em>Radiate Like This</em> in a way that was promised as far back as their debut. At the centre of the record are a pair of songs (‘Trouble’ &amp; ‘Proof’), which reach back more directly to <em>The Fool</em>, and in doing so call out a commendably subtle evolution in tone that might otherwise have gone undetected across the band&rsquo;s decade-plus of releases.</p>
<h3 id="14-beach-bunny--emotional-creature">14. Beach Bunny — <em>Emotional Creature</em></h3>
<p>Chicago four-piece Beach Bunny hit the lofty heights of <a href="/list2020">fourth on my 2020 list</a>, with their debut: <em>Honeymoon</em>. It was my absolute pleasure this year, to discover that there was plenty more where those joyous nine tracks came from.</p>
<p>On first listen, there doesn’t appear to be anything very complicated here; this is just a group of people with a first-class ear for hook and melody, employing those talents through lightly-fuzzed guitar, bass, and simple, functional percussion. The production (by Sean O’Keefe) feels a little cleaner than on the first record, perhaps indicative of a little more money having been spent by the good folks at Mom+Pop (now also home to Tegan &amp; Sara, which might make for a neat touring pair).</p>
<p>On further listens, however, it becomes clearer that — in keeping with that album title — there is not only variety to the emotions behind these songs (anxiety, passion, regret…), but also that the character of the songs themselves runs a wider spectrum than on their debut: punk-adjacent (‘Gone’) to acoustic folk-adjacent (‘Infinity Room’), and plenty of tones in-between. Throughout, however, the album’s core charm is another set of well-crafted singalongs at the poppier end of pop-rock. Records from this approximate continent of the musical map have been pushing my buttons for decades, which I think speaks to both the potency of the form, and Beach Bunny’s skill in capturing it.</p>
<h3 id="13-yugen--you">13. Yugen — <em>You</em></h3>
<p>This is the debut LP from Han Frissen working as Yugen. (His day job is running Dutch electronica label Konstrukt). Opening track ‘Resfeber’ serves as an exercise in mood-setting (complete with melodic flute), before ‘Toraberu’ begins to usher in a wider sonic palate for a record that pulls from multiple eras and subgenres of electronica, including reaching back to 90s sounds of which I’ve grown increasingly fond.</p>
<p>‘Seclusion’ stirs trip-hop elements in with breakbeat — a combination I would have raised an eyebrow at before I heard it, but which Frissen weaves into something either propulsive or a little maudlin, depending on whether you focus your attention on its dense arrangement of beats, or the slow waves of synth.</p>
<p>There are moments in which the beats are more rigorous, but the album never seeks to entirely shed its overall air of playfulness. Closer ‘Inves’, for example, begins as a somewhat strident march, before gentler, pastel-toned elements are brought forth in the mix to soften it, and a new balance is found.</p>
<p>I found the formula for this record to be magnetic: complex percussive arrangements, expertly wedded to expansive melodies. Yugen melds the two expertly, so as to bring forth a set of beautiful, subtle techno that made for some of my favourite headphone listening this year.</p>
<h3 id="12-mall-grab--what-i-breathe">12. Mall Grab — <em>What I Breathe</em></h3>
<p>As seriously as I take music, and as large a part of my life as it is, I’m still sometimes skeptical about the utility of sub-genre labels. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the digitisation of music, and particularly the advent of MP3s, brought about a previously unthinkable explosion in access to music, and thus any barriers previously gating exposure to even the most esoteric of sounds, evaporated. There’s a strong argument to be made, that a generation of musicians has now grown up entirely in a culture where every shade and strain of music enjoyed a level playing field. Yes, certain flavours of pop, hip-hop etc. still have the largest marketing budgets, and the most FM airplay. But, it’s only a matter of turning on one’s laptop or phone to access a whole world of sound. My thesis here — which I’m admittedly presenting solely on the basis of personal observation — is that sub-genres (and, arguably, genres themselves to an increasing extent) mean less now than they ever have, because an increasing number of artists feel free to ignore them, or work across them.</p>
<p>Depending on the whim of the staff, you might find Mall Grab’s debut LP in either the Dance, Electronic, or Techno sections of your local record store. First track ‘Hand in Hand Through Wonderland’ is a trance-adjascent piece centred on a pretty, chiming keyboard run, before ‘I Can Remember It So Vividly’ snatches the baton, and sprints with it. ‘Love Reigns’ is more-or-less straight house, with euphoric piano. Then, Turnstile’s Brendan Yates shows up to provide both screaming &amp; soothing vocals on ‘Understand’ — a track which otherwise sounds more like Bicep. That’s a run down of less than 1/3 of the record, and I’m already dizzy. What follows touches neo-soul, grime, and pure club sounds, before late highlight ‘Metaphysical’ — a mélange of techno breakbeats and ominous synths — and ‘Lost in Harajuku’ ring things out more subtly.</p>
<p>All of which sounds as though the record could be an un-coordinated, directionless mess. Whatever magic Jordon Alexander is working in the tight production helps tie the thing together, and made it a giddily enjoyable experience for me from first spin.</p>
<h3 id="11-amber-mark--three-dimensions-deep">11. Amber Mark — <em>Three Dimensions Deep</em></h3>
<p>Released on 28 January, this debut LP from R&amp;B / soul singer-songwriter Amber Mark is the longest standing record on this list. Since I first heard the opening salvo of ‘One’, eleven months ago, this was a strong contender, and it has only grown on me over time. The immediate allure was in poppier moments like the aforementioned ‘One’, on which Mark both sings soulfully and sing-raps her struggle with anger and insecurity. Follow-up ‘What It Is’ only further established this record&rsquo;s many gifts: a bold neo-soul slide which makes the most of Mark&rsquo;s impressive voice by layering it into the smoothest possible harmonies. The soulful ‘Most Men’ completes an opening trinity as strong as it is varied. But we&rsquo;re only getting started. ’Healing Hurts’ cuts an R&amp;B ballad with a pseudo-trap beat, for results far more compelling than that sounds; ‘Bubbles’ heads for the dance floor; elsewhere there are funk touches, blues samples, and lush string arrangements, all tied together by Mark&rsquo;s supremely polished songwriting, and velvet vocals. ‘Softly’ even samples turn-of-the-millennium Craig David to charming effect!</p>
<p>But the honeyed pop that drew me is really only the first layer of what proves to be a deeper record. Repeated listens reveal the extent to which Mark is telling a story across the hour running time. In a rough three act structure, she maps a journey through grief, towards acceptance. It’s easy to miss when you’re swaying to the funk arrangements of ‘Foreign Things’, or late highlight ‘Bliss’, but this is the most assured of debuts: musically and thematically vibrant and ambitious.</p>
<h3 id="10-yeah-yeah-yeahs--cool-it-down">10. Yeah Yeah Yeahs — <em>Cool It Down</em></h3>
<p>A new Yeah Yeah Yeahs record was always going to get my attention. Their 2003 debut, <em>Fever to Tell</em>, was an absolutely central part of the vanguard of exciting records that defined the sound of rock music in the early 21st century (alongside fellow heavy hitters like The Strokes' <em>Is This It,</em> Kings of Leon’s <em>Youth &amp; Young Manhood,</em> The White Stripes’ <em>White Blood Cells</em> etc.). In my estimation, follow-up <em>Show Your Bones</em> (2006) was not only better, but elevated to the pantheon of my favourite rock albums. It was third on my list that year, and has had more staying power for me in the years since than has proven true of the album immediately ahead of it: Thom Yorke’s <em>The Eraser</em> — a record I still play, but which I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself passionate about.</p>
<p>YYYs have certainly fallen off for me since: 2009’s <em>It’s Blitz</em> was pretty good (but notably not good enough for a list spot); 2013&rsquo;s <em>Mosquito</em> was largely forgettable — indeed, I don&rsquo;t think I’ve played it in the last 9 years. All of which makes <em>Cool It Down</em> the most pleasant of surprises.</p>
<p>Surely it’s no coincidence that opener ’Spitting Off the Edge of the World’ sits atop the same drum beat that powered <em>Show Your Bones</em>' opener ‘Gold Lion’. Here, however, it is both slower and more muted in the mix: a more relaxed, less bombastic heartbeat for a new YYYs sound.</p>
<p>Across a lot of different releases this year I noted a version of this slowing, along with an increased interest in dreamier, gauzier sounds. Dream-pop tones coloured several albums I enjoyed in 2022, but which didn’t end up making this list: shouts to SRSQ’s <em>Ever Crashing</em>, Jockstrap&rsquo;s <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em>, and even Taylor Swift&rsquo;s <em>Midnights</em> — all of which are playing with these colours to some extent. Overall, however, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' implementation — which reaches back to elements of their sound that have existed since they first arrived — worked on me like magic. Yes, it may be classifiable as a crime to have Nick Zinner (a genuinely top-tier guitarist) hardly pick up a guitar on this album, but Karen O&rsquo;s vocal shines when surrounded by floating synths.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn’t object if, next year, they followed it up with half an hour of pure garage rock, but in the here and now, <em>Cool It Down</em> really is something pretty special.</p>
<h3 id="9-duval-timothy--meeting-with-a-judas-tree">9. Duval Timothy — <em>Meeting With a Judas Tree</em></h3>
<p>Earlier this year I found myself in a jazz rut, which in turn led me down a jazz rabbit hole. I had been enjoying <em>Opening</em> by the Tord Gustavsen Trio*, but no other 2022 releases had stuck for me. So, I started casting about for new sounds, and at some point my exploration landed upon the 2017 album <em>Sen Am</em>, by Duval Timothy — a startling construction of piano-first jazz, and ambience. I developed a mild obsession with the record&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies, playing it so much that, when Timothy&rsquo;s new LP arrived in November, I immediately found myself struck by both its similarities and its differences.</p>
<p>First, the similarities. <em>Meeting With a Judas Tree</em> contains sections that read as direct responses, or otherwise continuations, of pieces from the five-year-old <em>Sen Am</em>. (It should be said, there are several releases in between, which I have not yet taken the time to adequately explore (beyond a cursory listen to Timothy&rsquo;s intriguing 2021 collaboration with pop / alternative singer-songwriter, Rosie Lowe), and so it&rsquo;s quite possible this is a musical conversation Duval Timothy has been carrying on <em>throughout</em> his work.) The four note sequences that underpin opener ‘Plunge’, feel unmistakably like an evolution of the refrain that plays the same role on <em>Sen Am</em>&rsquo;s first track ‘Whatsapp’; the older album’s ‘Ibs’ is reflected and refracted here on ‘Up’ — its joyful central melody re-situated amidst layers of effects, and treated audio samples.</p>
<p>This is one of the differences: a deepening (in places) of layers; an increased incorporation of field recordings, and looped elements, present on <em>Sen Am</em> but given new shapes here. Timothy&rsquo;s own liner notes also speak to a variety of recording techniques. One, which I found interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recorded on different pianos, including an upright in Freetown that had lost the felt of its hammers due to the humidity creating a harpsichord-like sound as the raw wood hit the strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) its relative delicacy, this was some of the most captivating music I heard all year, and certainly amongst the most beautiful. I was disappointed to miss the screenings of an accompanying short film at the ICA, but such mistakes are less likely to recur now that I’m officially hooked on every move Duval Timothy makes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->* indeed, it was one of the final shortlist of 35 records in contention for this list<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="8-dusky--pressure">8. Dusky — <em>Pressure</em></h3>
<p>From memory, this may be the first straight-up garage record that has made one of these lists. I’ve certainly had albums from the dancier-end of the electronica spectrum before, but this is a thoroughbred. It’s <em>also</em> explicitly an exercise in revisiting an older sound, which is perfect for me as someone who remained largely oblivious to the charms of dance music until a decade into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Even so, the primary building blocks here are now familiar to me: 2-step drum patterns, 4x4 rhythms, and playful use of vocal samples. The treated vocals and warping bass of ‘Northbound’ always inspires an increase in volume, and the (admittedly somewhat risible) vocal interjections on ‘Bubblin’’ never fail to bring a smile to my face. In fact, joy — more than anything else — is what I associate with this record. From the very first time I played it, dancing around my living room in the dark, it was a lock for this list. Its charms have not faded in the months since. When the bass kicks in on ‘Rollers’, followed by the vocal, and a chiming flourish that sounds like it could belong to a 16-bit <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game, catch me vibing!</p>
<h3 id="7-brainwaltzera--itsame">7. Brainwaltzera — <em>ITSAME</em></h3>
<p>Here, across 17 tracks and 74 minutes, the pseudonymous producer behind the Brainwaltzera alias lays out a banquet of sound which feels coherent and focussed despite its scope. <em>ITSAME</em> is defined by its meticulous arrangements of crisp, skittery beats and stuttering rhythms, and the interplay between those components and the frequent use of bright, warm chords.</p>
<p>Elements sit on a spectrum from the brief, light raindrops of ‘F1 Halo’, and the gentle melody atop ‘Morning Narcomnastics’, to the frenetic popcorn beat that rises and falls away on tracks like ‘A Star is Bored’ and ‘medal headz (G.B.D.F.)`. The record as a whole is a melting pot of styles and sounds, but in an arrangement that always feels as though it’s restlessly pushing for something new. Album highlight ‘Fwd: Re: late (Ref.: karoshi)’ is a six-minute simulacra of the LP: opening on moody chords, it introduces a tangle of synths, then an active, evolving percussive backbone. The wave crests with a moment of relative stillness, before the latter half reconsiders the relationships between now-familiar components. This is a generous and wide-ranging set of electronica with a playful sense of both space and density.</p>
<h3 id="6-bonobo--fragments">6. Bonobo — <em>Fragments</em></h3>
<p>On his seventh LP for Ninja Tune, Simon Green has pulled together an exceptionally well-crafted array of low-key techno, as warm and inviting as almost any record I played this year.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Polyghost’ is an introductory swell built from harp and strings, before the pulse of ‘Shadows’ arrives. That track showcases a tender vocal by Jordan Rakei atop a simple, clean percussion and continued strings. Elsewhere, ‘Otomo’ has some bombast, and makes admirable use of bagpipes — (like steel pan) an instrument I usually limit my exposure to when possible. ‘Age of Phase’ displays some urgency whilst underpinned by bright chords. ‘Tides’ is measured, whilst allowing Jamila Woods’ simple, honest, and expressive vocal room to breathe. And late highlight ‘Sapien’ brings in choppy synths and frenetic 90s percussion.</p>
<p>The album&rsquo;s composition is primarily subtle techno, with warm orchestral adornment, and down-tempo R&amp;B accents. For me, it’s working in a similar space to SBTRKT’s <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em>, which took <a href="/list2014">third on my 2014 list</a>. Like that album, it&rsquo;s an immensely polished artefact, and — Apple Music informs me — my most-played album of 2022. Multiple tracks, such as ‘Rosewood’ — which exudes warmth &amp; comfort — and ‘Elysian’ — a beautiful, characterful instrumental — conjure worlds of sound I gladly returned, time and again, to immerse myself in.</p>
<h3 id="5-tove-lo--dirt-femme">5. Tove Lo — <em>Dirt Femme</em></h3>
<p>Now here’s a record that immediately announced itself as a strong list contender from play number one. First track, ‘No One Dies From Love’, is one of the year’s best opening statements: an anthem awash with 80s-inspired synth tones, propulsive percussion, and striking, layered vocals. Then, Lo immediately complicates the emotional tone of the record by sequencing ‘Suburbia’ next: a darker flavour of pop, more forthright in tone, in which she rejects the natalist assumption that her new marriage will immediately result in children. Taken together, these two tracks serve as a good microcosm of an album that consistently finds Tove Lo exploring various aspects of her femininity, whilst — it should be made clear — having a lot of fun doing so.</p>
<p>Album highlight ‘2 Die 4’ is centred around a goosebump-inducing interpolation of Gershon Kingsley’s ‘Popcorn’ (1969) — its an irresistible infusion of joyful trance, and one of my tracks of the year. Elsewhere ‘True Romance’ builds into one of 2022’s most stirring vocal performances; ‘Grapefruit’ is a vulnerable reflection on eating disorders, wrapped in more anthemic 80s synth; and ‘Cute &amp; Cruel’ calls in assistance from First Aid Kit for a slice of grade-A folk balladry.</p>
<p>Some reviews of the record lamented the fact that Lo’s first outing as an independent artist eschews much of the more overt, confrontationally sexual leanings of her output on four previous albums for a major label. (There is still a song (‘Pineapple Slice’) entirely about cunnilingus.) For me, there’s a sense that this is Lo feeling more mature, less pressed to court notoriety, and more firmly in control of what her music should sound like. The result is an embrace of throwback pop sounds, and a record that is both unflinchingly honest, and unfailingly fun.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Side note: I would like to take this space to note that my 21st-favourite record of 2022 is by another pansexual Swede named Tove. <em>HARD</em> by (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/list2018">2018 List alumna</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Tove Styrke represents one of the most heart-rending omissions in recent memory, particularly as it contains my undisputed song of the year: ‘Show Me Love’.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="4-black-thought--danger-mouse--cheat-codes">4. Black Thought &amp; Danger Mouse — <em>Cheat Codes</em></h3>
<p>Danger Mouse hit my radar in 2003: I had a lot of fun with <em>Ghetto Pop Life</em>, the album-length collaboration he did with Jemini, and I can still hear ‘The Only One’ in my head as I type this, despite having not played it in probably a decade or more. The following year, <em>The Grey Album</em> — his mash-up of Jay-Z&rsquo;s <em>The Black Album</em> (2003) with The Beatles' 1968 &lsquo;white album&rsquo; — was an &lsquo;acquire these MP3s by any means necessary&rsquo; treat.</p>
<p>Black Thought I knew from his work with The Roots (2002’s <em>Phrenology</em> remains a favourite), but I was (shamefully) less familiar with his solo work.</p>
<p>In combination here, they’ve produced a soulful masterwork of low-key hip-hop. Danger Mouse’s beats pull from mid-century sounds — not just classic soul and funk, but psychedelia and progressive rock — lending the production a compelling off-kilter edge. Over this strange landscape of distorted organs, altered strings, and often muffled percussion, Black Thought delivers a masterclass in easy flow and scalpel-sharp wordplay.</p>
<p>There are variations in the production, such that opener ‘Sometimes’ and single ‘Aquamarine’ (which I <em>think</em> is sampling Garbage) feel expansive, whereas ‘Close to Famous’ feels like a straight-to-tape tirade as it rides an uneasy blues beat, and (another single) ‘No Gold Teeth’ is a close-quarters jam to a slice of highly-concentrated funk.</p>
<p>Front to back, <em>Cheat Codes</em> is a rousing delight; the inclusion of a previously-unheard verse by MF DOOM, on ‘Belize’, is a cherry on top.</p>
<h3 id="3-zella-day--sunday-in-heaven">3. Zella Day — <em>Sunday in Heaven</em></h3>
<p>Let me start by saying that I have listened to this album innumerable times, and feel no closer to understanding what it means to “mushroom punch [one’s] way down the rabbit hole”, as Zella Day is planning on the opening track. What I <em>can</em> tell you, is that ‘Mushroom Punch’ is a giddy delight that starts as a finger-picked folk tune, before exploding into a piece of Sparks-style operatic pop, and which — a little more than two minutes in — takes a pause for a Bee Gees-esque disco break, replete with hazy synth. That&rsquo;s the opening track: one of the most thrilling pop songs I encountered all year.</p>
<p>From there, we’re into ‘Am I Still Your Baby’, a self-assured slice of pop-rock on which Day allows her voice to somersault and soar, before sinking to a more intimate register. Then ‘Dance for Love’, which sounds like a lost 70s disco classic wrapped in sultry modern production.</p>
<p>Something that has become increasingly clear to me over the last few years, (and which may be apparent to the reader of this list) is that my favourite instrument — once the electric guitar — is now most-assuredly the female voice. There are captivating vocal passages on this record that bring to mind Kate Bush and Sinead O’Connor, as much as Lana Del Rey and Florence Welch. In combination with strong musical influences ranging from the golden-era of disco to straight-up country, it’s a record that may be confounding at first, but which has been endlessly fascinating and rewarding for me. From the emotional highs of ‘Golden’ (one album highlight among many) to the lower, but no less impassioned, ‘Last Time’, it’s a dizzying journey I grew increasingly comfortable with, and then found myself spellbound by.</p>
<h3 id="2-buck-65--king-of-drums">2. Buck 65 — <em>King of Drums</em></h3>
<p>Back in the early 2000s, I had begun the process of expanding my hip-hop horizons beyond the Aftermath Records artists on MTV. I was lucky enough to make friends with a real hip-hop head: a guy whose room in our university halls of residence was messy with vinyl records and obscure kung-fu movies on DVD. At the slightest sign of interest from me, he started pushing this material my way like an eager cult leader, sensing the opportunity to recruit. I didn’t own a turntable, but through sessions sat on his floor I began to absorb Eric B &amp; Rakim, Gang Starr, The Pharcyde, and many others. I count myself lucky to have had someone to raise the curtain for me a little, and show me what lay beyond my Dr Dre and Eminem CDs.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, poking around in the hip-hop section of some record store or another, I stumbled across a pair of albums: one called <em>Primitive Plus</em> (2002) by Edan, and the other titled <em>Square</em> (2002) by Buck 65. Together, these two albums exploded my conception of what hip-hop was, and what it could do. Edan only released one subsequent LP, but I picked up everything Buck 65 (aka Rich Terfry) put out for the next decade-plus. Until, that is, he released <em>Neverlove</em> in 2014, and subsequently went dark. His online presence evaporated, his website was taken down. Eventually I heard he was hosting a drive-time show on Canadian radio.</p>
<p>As the years stretched on, I had all but lost hope that we’d ever hear a note of new music from Buck 65 again. And yet, here we are. In 2020, Terfry collaborated with Controller 7 on a concept album based around the Vincent Gallo movie <em>Buffalo 66</em> (1998). Perhaps that relit the spark in him to make new music, because in 2022 he has been on a roll: digging in the vaults and putting up buried treasure on Bandcamp; a new collaborative LP with Tachichi; and a fascinating newsletter in which he has candidly laid out the story of his career. Most important of all though: a new Buck 65 record, which knocked my socks clean off the very first time I heard it. Old school production, absolutely <em>peerless</em> beat construction, and that familiar goofy flow spouting the weird and wonderful. It may have been eight years in the making, but my goodness the sheer amount of work and skill that has gone into it is stunning. Masterpiece — and easily his best since the record that completely spun my head two decades ago.</p>
<h3 id="1-metric--formentera">1. Metric — <em>Formentera</em></h3>
<p>Even amongst albums that I love, there are very few that I would call truly <em>flawless</em>. One of them is Metric’s 2012 LP <em>Synthetica</em> — 43 minutes of unimpeachable, razor-sharp, neon-infused synth-pop-rock; every one of its eleven tracks a gold-plated ★★★★★. That record placed <a href="/list2012">second on my 2012 list</a>, runner-up only to a resurgent Deftones' <em>Koi No Yokan</em> — I still enjoy that album a great deal, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that, at a decade&rsquo;s remove, those places would be switched. It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>Metric made another top 5 appearance on my list in 2015, with <em>Pagans in Vegas</em>, but 2018&rsquo;s <em>Art of Doubt</em> (whilst enormously enjoyable) fell a little short for me at the time. All of which brings us to <em>Formentera</em>, which grabbed me with a steel-lined velvet fist upon release in July, and hasn&rsquo;t loosened its grip.</p>
<p>From 10 minute opening epic ‘Doomscroller’ (which feels like three great songs in one, and embarrasses Arcade Fire at their own game of digital-era, humans-before-technology operatic angst), to the sun-kissed, elegiac closer ‘Paths in the Sky’ (Emily Haines’ voice trampolining up above the burbling bass-line), this is an album of exceptional vision and craft. In between, there’s the darkly joyous ‘All Comes Crashing’, the blissfuly dreamy title track, and the riotous, infectious album highlight ‘False Dichotomy’ — one of the year’s most goosebump-inducing songs, even on the 50th listen.</p>
<p>Whisper it, but, this might just be their best record.</p>

			 <p>Here are the odds for this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature. I would love to see King, Murakami, or Atwood win. DeLillo &amp; McCarthy feel like longer shots, but would nevertheless be welcome. I feel as though prizes for Rushdie or Mantel would be misinterpreted at the moment, no matter how well-deserved.</p>

<p>Frances Ha premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on this date a decade ago. Here’s my capsule review of it, from my <a href="/2020/06/20/favourite-films.html">list of favourite films</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most transcendent cinema-going experiences of my life. An unalloyed joy from beginning to end, with one of the most charming central performances imaginable. It’s about growing up too slowly, falling behind, not fitting in, feeling completely adrift, and trying to make peace with it. Despite all the ways in which I’m different from Frances, I’ve rarely felt so seen in (or reassured by) a piece of art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy birthday Frances.</p>

			 <p>It was a lot of fun to watch the Cubs beat the Reds out in an Iowa cornfield last night, in MLB’s <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-reds-field-of-dreams-game-2022">second annual Field of Dreams game</a>.</p>
<p>The moment where Willson Contreras turned his ankle rounding second base was (frankly) horrifying; I still can’t believe he stayed in the game!</p>
<p>I should also mention that the in-game interview with Joey Votto throughout the top of the 3rd inning was really wonderful — such a thoughtful, interesting guy. ⚾️</p>

			 <p>More than a decade ago, I took my girlfriend on a date to see a movie, without telling her anything about it. The film in question was Sylvain Chomet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/BMqpU7lUlLg"><em>L’illusionniste</em></a> (2010), and we both ended up having to stay in our seats whilst the credits rolled, so as not to leave the cinema sobbing.</p>
<p>Last week, this incident came up in conversation with friends, and yesterday the film was <a href="https://mubi.com/films/the-illusionist-2010">added to MUBI</a> as their film of the day. I strongly recommend it, with only one caveat: make sure you have tissues to hand. 🐰</p>

			 <p>One year ago, the trade deadline was a massacre for the underperforming Chicago Cubs. The heart of the 2016 World Series winning team: All Star, multiple gold glove-winning first baseman Anthony Rizzo; All Star, former rookie of the year Kris Bryant; and All Star, most exciting player in baseball Javier Báez were all traded away within a 24 hour period, leaving both the roster, and my chest, feeling hollowed out. This year’s deadline — which falls today, 2 Aug — also has a heavy, dark cloud hanging over it. I’m checking the MLB app every couple of hours to see whether All Star offensive catcher Willson Contreras, and All Star left fielder Ian Happ have been traded away, likely in return for prospects whose names I don’t know, and whose future belongs still to the realm of theory, as unpredictable as a dice roll. ⚾️</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3/8 Update<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Good morning to everyone! And especially to Willson Contreras and Ian Happ, who are both still Chicago Cubs! All the best to Martin, Effross, Robertson, &amp; Givens with their new teams.</p>

			 <p>On Tuesday the longlist was announced for <a href="https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/prize-years/2022">this year’s Booker Prize</a>. I have no intention of reading all 13 novels this year (as I did <a href="/booker21">last year</a>), but I&rsquo;ll nevertheless be keeping an eye on conversation surrounding the Prize, for tips on what I should add to my ‘to be read’ pile.</p>
<p>As is expected, it’s a diverse set of novels, with the headline being that this year includes both the youngest (Leila Mottley: 20) and oldest (Alan Garner: 87) authors ever nominated. (Aside: imagine being nominated for the Booker at 20!) There are also three debuts: from the aforementioned Leila Mottley; Selby Wynn Schwartz; and Maddie Mortimer, whose <em>Maps of Our Spectacular Bodies</em> tops my personal list of the nominated novels I intend to get to.</p>
<p>I’m also intrigued by <em>Case Study</em> from previous shortlistee (<em>His Bloody Project</em> in 2016) Graeme Macrae Burnet. Check out this setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>London, 1965. An unworldly young woman believes that a charismatic psychotherapist, Collins Braithwaite, has driven her sister to suicide. Intent on confirming her suspicions, she assumes a false identity and presents herself to him as a client</p>

			 <p>I may have developed whiplash given the speed with which I just went from ‘when is that <em>Paper Girls</em> adaptation out, and how can I watch it?’, to ‘holy shoot, it’s out <strong>today</strong> and <strong>all eight episodes</strong> are available on Prime Video right now!’</p>
<p>One of my favourite comics of recent years; I just hope the show is good. I also hope it’s successful enough to stick around. I really liked the (long awaited) adaptation of BKV’s <em>Y: The Last Man</em>, and it sure stings that it got cancelled after a single season. If I had all the money in the world…</p>

			 <p>Some fun stuff at yesterday’s <a href="https://youtu.be/UeQYiKQoH_g">Annapurna Interactive Showcase</a>. <em>Hindsight</em> — which releases next week — looks like it might share something in common with <em>A Memoir Blue</em>; new project teases from Cardboard Computer and Keita Takahashi; Third Shift’s <em>Forever Ago</em> looks really nice (I hope it turns out better than <em>Lake</em>, which looked to have a similar vibe but didn’t play super well); and a 4K, PS5 native version of one of my all-time favourite games: <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, ready to make me cry all over again. 🕹️</p>

			 <p>Complaints — almost exclusively from white men — about ‘wokeness’ or ‘forced diversity’ in mainstream culture have become exhaustingly predictable. And yet, this is the current carousel of featured movies in the iTunes Store, here in May 2022:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/34fd1182d0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are more lead roles here for Tom Holland (2), than there are for people who aren’t white men (0). There is such a <em>long</em> way to go. (NB. at the the same time, the cinemas are full of Tom Cruise, Benedict Cumberbatch, &amp; Chris Pratt.)</p>
<p>By contrast — and because Star Wars Celebration was this week — consider the leads on the current live-action Star Wars projects: Ewan McGregor yes, but also Pedro Pascal, Temuera Morrison, Rosario Dawson, &amp; Diego Luna. This is also work being made with truly diverse supporting casts, and created by an equally diverse team of writers, directors etc. I’ve been really happy to see Disney push the franchise in this area since taking ownership of it almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1531804726165401600?s=20&amp;t=wDmfuoWYL5UljSwtKzOOhw">and yet…</a></p>

			 <p>This week a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473">leaked draft opinion</a> from the US Supreme Court made more likely the prospect of widespread banning of abortions across the country. The news shaped a lot of what I&rsquo;ve been reading and watching lately, and in <a href="/tendrils003">this weekend&rsquo;s issue of Tendrils</a> I&rsquo;m going to be sharing notes on some fiction and documentary films I watched. I also wanted to make space to share some links to, and excerpts from, the best pieces of journalism I read on the topic:</p>
<p>• ’<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/05/roe-v-wade-limits-of-privilege.html#_ga=2.6245626.837078935.1653042934-866592180.1653042934">The Limits of Power in a Post-Roe World</a>’ by Rebecca Traister in the May 9-22, 2022 issue of <em>New York</em> magazine</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the reasoning behind abortion bans is a lie. Bans do not stop abortions from happening. Rather, they are meant to punish people for asserting control over their bodies, lives, and families, and the people who get punished more cruelly and regularly in this country have always been people who are not white and not wealthy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• ’<a href="https://apple.news/AZ7yQVFCBTOOLzzEifTDcUA">The anti-abortion movement is about to win. Even it isn’t ready for what comes next</a>’ by Anna North in issue #37 of <em>The Highlight</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is this same groups of people who are surveilled, suspected, targeted by law enforcement in all realms of their life, who are the ones who are going to be disproportionately criminalized for self-managing abortion,” Adams said. That includes “Black, Indigenous and other people of color, immigrants, trans and gender non-conforming folks, and certainly people living in poverty, as well as people living in rural areas and young people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• ’<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2022/5/5/23057317/abortion-supreme-court-roe-v-wade">Abortion has been treated as a fringe issue by Democrats for decades. This is the result</a>’ by Anna North for Vox</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The marginalization of abortion in Democratic politics is at least as old as Roe v. Wade. The 1973 decision, which established a constitutional right to an abortion, may have given liberals a false sense of security, Goodwin said. “There was a confidence that the United States was a country that would not roll back, and that would not reach back to its worst tendencies.” It wasn’t just Roe. Americans had also seen the recent gains of the civil rights movement, including the Voting Rights Act and integration of schools, after brutal and sometimes bloody fights. There was “this sense that we can breathe now in the 1970s,” Goodwin said, “that now we can say we’ve learned from these horrors of the past and that we will not take lightly what respecting equality truly means under this flag.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• ’<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-the-us-could-learn-from-abortion-without-borders">What the U.S. Could Learn from Abortion Without Borders</a>’ (by Anna Louise Sussman for The New Yorker) centres around comparison with a European assistance network that works to help people seeking abortions in countries such as Poland (where abortion was made illegal in 1993)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What seems unusual about Abortion Without Borders is that it combines highly visible advocacy, logistical support for abortions, and funding from major N.G.O.s and governments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• ’<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23057032/supreme-court-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade-state-aid">The end of Roe will mean more children living in poverty</a>’ by Dylan Scott for Vox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The children born in these circumstances will start life a few steps behind, all because their political leaders strove to ban abortion without offering support to the children who would be born if their aims were achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• ’<a href="https://jezebel.com/abortion-bans-rape-exceptions-effect-survivors-1848516164">Abortion Bans Are Disregarding the Lives of Sexual Assault Survivors</a>’ by Kylie Cheung for Jezebel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The landmark Turnaway Study on the impacts of being unable to access abortion care found that being forced to keep an unwanted pregnancy significantly increases the risk of being entrapped in an abusive relationship. Another study found nearly a tenth of people who seek abortion care are trying to end their pregnancies because they have abusive partners. Fifteen percent of women experiencing intimate partner violence reported that their partners also subjected them to reproductive coercion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I’d also recommend episode 48 of the <em>Strict Scrutiny</em> podcast — ‘<a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/whats-next-in-a-post-roe-world/">What’s Next in a Post-Roe World</a>’ — a conversation between Supreme Court watchers, legal scholars, and a professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology &amp; Reproductive Sciences.</p>

			 <p>Happy Star Wars Day to you. As has become tradition, I&rsquo;ve updated my checklist of canon media, and you can grab a PDF <a href="/uploads/2023/7a1c3a3b31.pdf">here</a>. This is a checklist of (as near as I can make it) every item of canon Star Wars media intended for young adults and above. (There are several books, comics, and cartoon shorts intended for a younger audience not included here, though they are canon; please don&rsquo;t consider this list <em>absolutely</em> exhaustive, but I think it&rsquo;s a good basis for an adult or young adult looking to get a sense of the canon.) You can find other versions of things like this elsewhere on the web, but this is a list I&rsquo;ve put together for myself, and which I use when reading, watching, and playing my way through all things Star Wars.</p>
<p>My thanks as always in this endeavour go to the folks who maintain Wookieepedia&rsquo;s indispensable <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media">&lsquo;Timeline of Canon Media&rsquo;</a>: a sortable list of <em>all</em> canon material, and also to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StarWarsExplained/featured">Star Wars Explained</a> YouTube channel.</p>

			 <p>I really like <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lost-thread/">these thoughts</a> from Robin Sloan, related to this week’s Twitter news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways people might relate to one another online, so many ways exchange and conviviality might be organized. Look at these screens, this wash of pixels, the liquid potential! What a colossal bummer that Twitter eked out a local maximum; that its network effect still (!) consumes the fuel for other possibilities, other explorations.</p>

			 <p>I’m not a game designer, but a couple of nights ago a puzzle came to me in a dream, more or less complete. It seems like a waste not to do <em>something</em> with it, so I thought I&rsquo;d at least write it up. If you are a game designer, or you have another use for any part of this, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to it.</p>
<p>The basis of the puzzle is a rectangular room, at the centre of which is a long, rectangular table. There’s one chair on each side of the table, perhaps more ornate ones on the two ends, and simpler ones on the longer sides. Elsewhere in the game — perhaps throughout the wider house — there should be contextual clues that will enable the player to discern which of four family members sits in each of the four spots. As an example (and because this is how it was in my dream), let’s call these people Adam, Eve, Cain, &amp; Abel.</p>
<p>Around the room, on and against each of its four walls, there should be a series of items with unique, distinctive features: eg. a painting of a sunset; a sculpture of a whale; a taxidermy owl; a vase of flowers. Taken together, here’s a sketch of the basic layout:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/084085b79f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The puzzle itself operates by giving the player a prompt, comprising a subject and a vantage point: eg. ‘Sunset, aspect of Cain’. The player must determine in which cardinal direction the corresponding object in the room sits <strong>in relation to</strong> the named person; they must then press the corresponding direction on their controller’s directional pad. The correct response to the prompt above, therefore, would be ↑.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, let me note that in my dream this actually had to be done for two object / vantage pairs, simultaneously. The prompt read eg. ‘Sunset, aspect of Abel; Whale, aspect of Eve’, and two inputs had to be made simultaneously: one on the directional pad, and one on the face buttons. The correct response to the above prompt would be ↓ &amp; B on an Xbox controller, or ↓ &amp; ◯ on a PlayStation controller. A series of five correct dual-inputs had to be made, against a short timer, to complete the puzzle. This was one of those frustration dreams where you repeatedly attempt and fail at a task, so if you do implement any version of this, I’d consider staying away from this more complicated iteration!</p>

			 <p>The first thing I see when I open my eyes in the morning depends upon which way I&rsquo;ve rolled during the night. If I wake up laying on my right side, I open my eyes to see my partner; if I&rsquo;ve rolled left, the first thing I see is this:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/fe102cb77b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This little tableau features a small metal Buddha, serving as both a hook for a rosewood mala, and a prop to keep a postcard upright. It&rsquo;s the postcard I want to talk about: I picked it up at Ai Weiwei&rsquo;s show at the Royal Academy in 2015; it shows his triptych &lsquo;Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn&rsquo; (1995). Here&rsquo;s a better look at the artwork:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/34905d4d12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Much of the commentary around this piece focusses on the (seven figure) value of the urn in question, but for my purposes it could just as easily have been an entirely unremarkable, mass-produced ceramic vase. I use this postcard as a daily reminder of impermanence. Looking at it, I imagine that the first image of the triptych represents my waking moments, with the day ahead. The day itself will be the second image: suspended in air, but in motion. The third image is inevitable: it&rsquo;s the night that will arrive to close the day out. I find it useful to be reminded that each day passes like this, and that we experience time in one direction only. Once night arrives, you can no more return to the day than the urn can spring into the air, un-shattered.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just days, of course — this is also the manner in which our lives pass. I&rsquo;m publishing this today as it happens to be the fourth anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s death. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that event itself remains the most powerful example in my life that everything is impermanent. This idea is also at the center of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, which is how I know he doesn&rsquo;t mind propping up the postcard. I understand that the very idea of <em>momento mori</em> can provoke a reflexive flinch – the mind does not want to ponder its own extinguishing — but I find value in having this metaphor at hand as a reminder. Whatever the day holds, it is unique and it is transient, and it is worth being present for. (I feel the same way if I wake facing the other direction.)</p>

			 <p>There are a small number of movies that I enjoyed, but would never want to sit through again. The first example that springs to mind in this category is <em>Blood Diamond</em>, Edward Zwick&rsquo;s 2006 film about civil war in Sierra Leone. From what I recall — it&rsquo;s been 15 years — the central performances by Leonardo DiCaprio &amp; Djimon Hounsou are excellent, and the film is a very well-directed, taut thriller. What I do remember very clearly however, is the feeling of sitting in front of the end credits, thinking &lsquo;that was really good, and I never want to see it again&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a large number of these movies for me. It&rsquo;s a tricky category to fall into, since the film has to be both genuinely impressive <em>and</em> so emotionally exhausting that I couldn&rsquo;t face it a second time. Within this small group, however, there is an <em>even smaller</em> subset of films that disturbed and exhausted me, and yet which are <em>so</em> brilliant that I will in fact watch them again (and again). There are only a handful such films, the most prominent amongst them: Nicolas Winding Refn&rsquo;s wildly under-appreciated <em>The Neon Demon</em> (2016), and Darren Aronofsky&rsquo;s <em>mother!</em> (2017)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A couple of years ago, when I put together a <a href="/20films">list of my all time favourite movies</a>, these two came in 20th &amp; 5th respectively. They are both body horror pictures in some sense, though it&rsquo;s not the graphic violence or gore that ever gets to me – it&rsquo;s the way that the directors ratchet up the tension, click by click, without any respite for the viewer. Couple this with a sympathetic central character, portrayed by a stellar actor, and these films become so emotionally fraught for me as to become a physical experience – art that reaches past the cerebrum to provoke a limbic response.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/dbe1d93aab.png" alt="">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Illustration by Ollie Tilney<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>All of which is to say that I recently added a new title to this list: Julia Ducournau&rsquo;s <em>Titane</em> (2021).</p>
<p>In some respects, the less a potential viewer knows going in to the movie, the better — so much of the film&rsquo;s power is derived from the ways in which it flaunts expectations. I will say that Ducournau&rsquo;s script and direction are unbounded; Ruben Impens&rsquo;s camera is unflinching; and Agathe Rousselle&rsquo;s debut performance in a feature film is as raw and fearless as they come. It&rsquo;s an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, and a worthy Palme d&rsquo;Or winner. The only reservations I have about recommending it wholeheartedly are around viewer disposition – it&rsquo;s assuredly not for everyone.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2022/03/17/difficulty-in-games.html">Difficulty in Games</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2022/03/17/difficulty-in-games.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-16 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Mar 16, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about the concept of difficulty in art, and how it applies differently across media — how we <em>mean</em> different things by the word, depending on what we&rsquo;re applying the label to.</p>
<p>The spark for this line of thinking is usually encountering a particularly hard section, or element, of a video game. In games — and, specifically, PvE (player vs environment) games — the person with the controller in their hands pits their wits, reactions, and sometimes temperament, against the game itself. At a very basic level, progress through the game is measured in successful actions taken. Bopped an enemy on the head? That&rsquo;s a little bit of progress. Collected a coin? That&rsquo;s progress. Reached the end of a level? Progress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very reductive way of thinking about it, and there are uncountable different ways in which these variables can be altered by the game designer, but regardless, the heart of games is that <strong>progress is attained through player action</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn’t the case in any other artistic medium. Nothing is required of the listener for a song, or even a whole symphony, to play out and conclude. I can attest from personal experience that films and television shows will run uninhibited before even the most disinterested viewer. Paintings and sculptures do not care whether you pay attention to them, but leave Sonic alone for a few seconds and he&rsquo;ll start <a href="https://youtu.be/LRN3oj7-CWI">tapping his foot</a>, impatient for you to make progress.</p>
<p>Books present an interesting middle ground. Unlike those artforms that can be received (even enjoyed) passively, reading takes work. The reader must make an effort to translate graphemes into concepts, and to parse meaning from a sustained series of them. And where there is effort required, the concept of difficulty necessarily arises. A children&rsquo;s picture book requires far less of the reader than a work of literature intended for adults. This difficulty is denoted in, and results from, the complexity of both language and ideas employed by the author: a greater number of graphemes to translate, a denser web of meaning to discern.</p>
<p>However, unlike in games, the difficulty of a text does not prevent progress in at least one form. It is perfectly possible for anyone who has attained the skill of translating letter combinations into sounds, to make their way through <em>Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake</em>. That reader will recognise a good number of words in the text, and can take a phonetic stab at the rest; step-by-step, one unit of the artwork at a time, they can make their way through to the end. The degree of <em>meaning</em> that this particular reader is able to discern from the work is going to be minimal, but a lack of comprehension can only slow and not halt their material progress.</p>
<p>Only in video games is progress gated by player skill. Moment-to-moment the player is called upon to assess game state, make mental calculations about their next move, and then perform the physical inputs on a controller so as to effect it. If you are not capable of doing this, you will fail to progress: you will not be able to manoeuvre your character to reach the door, you will not solve the puzzle that rewards you with the key, or you will be repeatedly defeated in combat by the enemy on the other side.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve conceived of this issue for a long while, but lately I&rsquo;ve been wondering whether some more consideration needs to be made of the derivable value of the artwork in question.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say that the core value of a game is the joy it elicits, and the core value of a literary work is the meaning it provides. In this respect, whilst little may prevent one from making one&rsquo;s way through the physical form of a text, the meaning one is able to extract from it <em>will</em> vary depending upon the &lsquo;skill&rsquo; of the reader. (This may include vocabulary, imagination, understanding of context, emotional availability, and any number of other factors.) In this respect the text as artwork operates as a partnership between writer &amp; reader: how effectively the former is able to capture in writing the ideas, emotions, and meaning that they desire to convey; and how adroitly the latter is able to decode the same<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the case of a game, the responsibilities that lie more or less solely with the author in the above example<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> may be distributed across any number of individuals depending on the game: designers who work to construct narrative, atmosphere, mechanics: the world of the game, the way it sounds, its characters, what the player can and cannot affect, and how. By virtue of the inextricable link between player action and progress, the player&rsquo;s role is shaped by the designer(s). They can certainly choose to move their character in a circle <em>ad infinitum</em>, but no progress will be made. Progress depends upon overcoming the challenges set by the designer(s), and doing so requires skill. Thus, whilst games uniquely gate progress based on player skill, both games and literature require audience attention, effort, and a form of skill in order for their inherent value to be realised.<br>

<p>All of this is just me thinking out loud, and the binary I&rsquo;ve constructed here is pretty weak. Plenty of writing prioritises enjoyment over meaning, and there are certainly games that seek to provide something to the player other than (or beyond) simple enjoyment. However, I am increasingly convinced that value is an important concept here beyond the simple question of being notionally present for an artwork&rsquo;s duration.</p>

<p>This is certainly not to say that the value of any artwork is dependant on the clarity with which it communicates the artist&rsquo;s <em>specific</em> intent. The immense value of personal, individual meaning being derived by the audience is precisely what makes art beautiful and powerful.  &#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-tyler-the-creator--call-me-if-you-get-lost">20. Tyler, The Creator — <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em></h3>
<p>Tyler hit 12th on my 2019 list with <em>IGOR</em>, an album that captivated and confounded me in equal measure, with its structural inventiveness. That was a poppier affair than we&rsquo;re in for this time out — <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em> is more interested in putting a spin on various rap sub-genres. Soul samples and R&amp;B textures ebb &amp; flow throughout another album-as-album exercise in layered production, restless structures, and tongue-in-cheek lifestyle boasting. Once again, Tyler made my favourite hip-hop LP of the year.</p>
<h3 id="19-weezer--ok-human">19. Weezer — <em>OK Human</em></h3>
<p>Imagine if you were a member of a church, or a friend group or something, and over the years you&rsquo;d developed a bunch of rites or in jokes or whatever. If you were to try and bring a new person into that circle, they&rsquo;d meet a wall of resistance in the form of the very shared customs and understanding that you had been enjoying for years. Which is to say: I would not know where to begin if I was tasked with explaining Weezer&rsquo;s 2021 output to someone who hasn&rsquo;t been along for the ride with this band for at least two full decades.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I will say:</p>
<p>a) <em>OK Human</em> is a sneaky complex album. It was introduced as the lockdown project the band put together in lieu of releasing and touring their love letter to metal: <em>Van Weezer</em>. In truth it&rsquo;s a pop-rock record with a freaking string section! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve encountered that since Silverchair tapped Van Dyke Parks as a collaborator in 2002.</p>
<p>b) I wish this record had been released as a freakish Jekyll &amp; Hyde double-album with <em>Van Weezer</em>, so that I could find room for both of them on this list. On balance, this is the more consistently enjoyable of the two LPs, even if it&rsquo;s something like the band&rsquo;s sixth best record overall.</p>
<p>c) The best track Weezer released this year (by a country mile) is &lsquo;Sheila Can Do It&rsquo;, which has been only lightly revised since <a href="https://youtu.be/k6rJxp6eDk8">its 1997 demo version</a>. Take that for what you will.</p>
<h3 id="18-celeste--not-your-muse">18. Celeste — <em>Not Your Muse</em></h3>
<p>I was already infatuated with Celeste&rsquo;s debut by the time it was shortlisted for the 2021 Mercury Prize. Its sonic warmth and thematic vulnerability made for a valued companion throughout year two of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ideal Woman&rsquo; is the gentlest beginning, and a perfect showcase for both the richness of Celeste&rsquo;s voice, and the candidness of her lyrics; &lsquo;Strange&rsquo; is an equally tender paean on loss, and then the album begins to open up to a larger sound. What follows is a set of soul and R&amp;B-inflected pop that never falters. The album&rsquo;s single strongest track is still probably the understated bombast of &lsquo;Love is Back&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s in good company right through to the touching declaration in &lsquo;A Little Love&rsquo;: &ldquo;Of all the things to be / I choose a kindness&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="17-ben-kweller--circuit-boredom">17. Ben Kweller — <em>Circuit Boredom</em></h3>
<p>A round of applause, please, for the first record I listened to this year! Released on 1 January, Kweller&rsquo;s sixth LP-shaped collection of rock-flavoured, pop-shaped confections as a solo artist has hung on effortlessly for twelve months to make this list. Eight songs and 28 minutes maybe pushes the boundaries of eligibility, but this is as note-perfect a piece of work as BK has released since his eponymous album 15 years ago. It contains all the flavours of Kweller that you know and love: pop stomper (opener &lsquo;Starz&rsquo;); vulnerable acoustic ballad ((part of) &lsquo;Just For Kids&rsquo;); &amp; lo-fi crunchy: on album high point &lsquo;Heart Attack Kid&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already a fan, <em>Circuit Boredom</em> isn&rsquo;t going to change any minds. For the rest of us, however, your face is going to be hurting from smiling by the time you&rsquo;re singing along to &lsquo;Wanna Go Home&rsquo;&hellip; and then circling right back to play the record again.</p>
<h3 id="16-ill-considered--liminal-space">16. Ill Considered — <em>Liminal Space</em></h3>
<p>Ill Considered are a hyper-prolific improvisational jazz ensemble. The aptly titled <em>Liminal Space</em> is the group&rsquo;s first recorded work to mix live performances with post-production elements. Here the central trio of saxophone, bass, and drums are artfully supplemented with additions from guest players, bringing a rich and full-bodied sound to initially improvised pieces.</p>
<p>This is complex and high-paced music, with some tracks (eg. &lsquo;The Lurch&rsquo; and &lsquo;Light Trailed&rsquo;) featuring time signatures so complicated they can overwhelm. However, listening via headphones, and surrendering to the build and swell, I found few listening experiences more rewarding this year.</p>
<p>(Side note: the album features one of the year&rsquo;s best covers, by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vincent.deboer/">Dutch artist Vincent de Boer</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="15-koreless--agor">15. Koreless — <em>Agor</em></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Yonder&rsquo; is an expanding bloom of a curtain raiser before the real action begins, and then it&rsquo;s off to the races for a half hour of dense electronica that plays masterfully with tension and release. There&rsquo;s a wide instrumental palate at play throughout, such as on &lsquo;White Picket Fence&rsquo;: built out of eerie synths, fuzzy bass keys, and a somersaulting set of vocal samples played as an instrument. Likewise &lsquo;Joy Squad&rsquo; makes use of dehumanised vocal stabs set amid a bed of alarming cinematic strings and skittering beats.</p>
<p>Tracks often increase in intensity and complexity, pushing on when they feel almost like they should back off – but beyond these thresholds, Koreless often finds a place of euphoric calm.</p>
<h3 id="14-bicep--isles">14. Bicep — <em>Isles</em></h3>
<p>The second LP from Northern Irish electronica twosome Bicep is an exercise in treading the line between headphones and the dance floor. For me it became a go-to AirPods-in record — its grooves (some trance, some more propulsive) lushly mixed and captivating throughout a varied tracklist. Drawing on a deep pool of samples, from Hindi bops to Turkish pop, Bicep weave a rich and ever-shifting sonic tapestry. Album highlight &lsquo;Apricots&rsquo; pulls together Bulgarian folk with a Malawian polyrhythmic vocal to astounding effect.</p>
<h3 id="13-japanese-breakfast--jubilee">13. Japanese Breakfast — <em>Jubilee</em></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a band that I feel bad about having paid too little attention to previously. Two albums (<em>Psychopop</em> (2016) &amp; <em>Soft Sounds From Another Planet</em> (2017)) have passed without me noticing, and it took — of all things — an exceptionally good video game soundtrack (for this autumn&rsquo;s low key, exploration-focussed coming-of-age game <em>Sable</em>) to really put Japanese Breakfast on my radar.</p>
<p>I was only a couple of tracks into my first listen of <em>Jubilee</em> before I was almost literally kicking myself. Here was the soft-focussed, pastel-hued update to Bat For Lashes' sound that I hadn&rsquo;t realised I wanted. Ambitious, expansive pop music that is unafraid to experiment with weirder tonal inclusions.</p>
<p>My former neglectfulness now corrected, band leader Michelle Zauner&rsquo;s memoir is even on my Kindle ready for holiday reading, and I will certainly be awaiting whatever comes next musically.</p>
<h3 id="12-moin--moot">12. Moin — <em>Moot!</em></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an unexpected pleasure from the summer. <em>Moot!</em> is a strangely out-of-time artefact deeply reverent of 90s post-hardcore. Intense no matter which of its numerous gears it&rsquo;s operating in, it&rsquo;s the closest thing to Fugazi or Slint that I&rsquo;ve encountered in quite a while. &lsquo;Right is Alright, Wrong is to Belong&rsquo; is a haunting claustrophobic crawl, whereas &lsquo;Lungs&rsquo; is more animated, with wilder swings. Much of the album retains an almost live-seeming feel, owing to the record&rsquo;s few-frills production, which only adds to its Sub Pop-adjacent charms.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an absolute pleasure to surrender time and again to the waves of distorted guitar, the inventive bass lines, and Valentina Magaletti&rsquo;s frenetic percussion.</p>
<h3 id="11-ross-from-friends--tread">11. Ross From Friends — <em>Tread</em></h3>
<p>Felix Weatherall&rsquo;s trick to making his second record for Brainfeeder was to write an additional piece of bespoke software that sat on his laptop and just began recording automatically when his compositions met certain parameters. This method, implemented to overcome procrastination and choice paralysis, has resulted in a diverse set of electronica that hangs together remarkably well despite the swings from track-to-track. &lsquo;Revellers&rsquo; starts from a pure house foundation and builds something deep and sprawling; &lsquo;Morning Sun in a Dusty Room&rsquo; is a three-minute slice of glowing ambience; and &lsquo;Life in a Mind&rsquo; takes a soul sample for a kinetic trip punctuated by a brief, affecting melancholy dip.</p>
<h3 id="10-vijay-iyer-linda-may-han-oh--tyshawn-sorey--uneasy">10. Vijay Iyer, Linda May Han Oh, &amp; Tyshawn Sorey — <em>Uneasy</em></h3>
<p>Earlier in the year I found myself returning repeatedly to the <a href="https://youtu.be/L_XJ_s5IsQc">same video</a> of Snarky Puppy performing their 10 minute opus &lsquo;Lingus&rsquo; to a stunned studio audience. And, whilst Cory Henry&rsquo;s keyboard solo is undoubtedly the showpiece, I became fascinated by the drumming of Larnell Lewis. This sent me on a bit of a jazz drumming journey in the middle part of the year, and I found <em>Uneasy</em> at exactly the right time to get hypnotised by Tyshawn Sorey&rsquo;s intricate, constantly surprising work.</p>
<p>Alongside Sorey here are longtime collaborator Linda May Han Oh on bass, and Iyer at the piano. Each is an extraordinary player, and the combination feels natural and marvellous. This may be their first record together, but I certainly hope it&rsquo;s not the last. The trio has fast become one of my very favourite configurations for jazz, precisely because of the way it allows for both interplay and the spotlighting of individual excellence. A few of the tracks here have been reworked from compositions originally for sextets or even string orchestras, and the increased intimacy is something I really valued: the opportunity to spend time with each of the exceptional players within the frameworks of these spacious arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="9-st-vincent--daddys-home">9. St. Vincent — <em>Daddy&rsquo;s Home</em></h3>
<p>An artist as restlessly inventive as Annie Clark was never likely to settle for making more of the same. So, <em>Daddy&rsquo;s Home</em> heralds a new look, a new persona, and a new sound. A very definite 90-degree turn from <em>Masseduction</em> (6th in 2017), here 70s synth tones colour the album&rsquo;s experiments with soul, blues, and even hints at psychedelia (&lsquo;Live in the Dream&rsquo;). But, as always, Clark&rsquo;s treading her own path through these pastures. &lsquo;The Melting of the Sun&rsquo; manages to be both melancholy and unsettling, interweaved with a stirring soul background vocal. &lsquo;Down&rsquo; borrows the vocal progression from Nirvana&rsquo;s &lsquo;You Know You&rsquo;re Right&rsquo;, and transplants it into a funk-rock setting. And &lsquo;My Baby Wants a Baby&rsquo; is a brilliant, cutting, tongue-in-cheek update to Sheena Easton’s Prozac-happy 1980 anthem to obedient housewifery: ‘Morning Train (Nine to Five)’.</p>
<p>Clark remains consistently one of the artists I&rsquo;m most fascinated by. I haven&rsquo;t yet got around to the recently-released documentary / horror movie (?) <em>The Nowhere Inn</em>, but I&rsquo;ve every faith it&rsquo;s a continuation of her ceaseless playing with persona and form. I will happily follow wherever she chooses to go next.</p>
<p>Side note: this record also brings producer Jack Antonoff back to my list for the forth year out of the last five. Varied as the sounds have been across his projects with St Vincent and Taylor Swift, he&rsquo;s reaching the status of producer whose name alone will make me try a record.</p>
<h3 id="8-halsey--if-i-cant-have-love-i-want-power">8. Halsey — <em>If I Can&rsquo;t Have Love, I Want Power</em></h3>
<p>When Halsey hit second spot on my list last year, it was with an emo / pop-rock album peppered with outside influences: folk, R&amp;B, Korean rap&hellip;. It was a curious mix that worked supremely well on me, but certainly left me perplexed as to what a follow-up would sound like. I would not have predicted the menacing, polygenre tour-de-force that this collaboration with Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross has yielded.</p>
<p>At heart Halsey has described the record as a concept album about the beauty and horror of pregnancy and birth. Many of their lyrics have a destructive bent, even when fascinated by acts of love and creation. Tender vocals over a sea of dark synths; a mélange of hopes and fears. It&rsquo;s a tension that makes for a record constantly wrestling with itself, content only to keep moving forward and growing as it goes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Easier Than Lying&rsquo; would be at home on a Grimes record, and &lsquo;Girl is a Gun&rsquo; (with its hyperkinetic breakbeat) could be a lost Robyn classic. Over here we have Lindsay Buckingham fingerpicking guitar on the simple, beautiful &lsquo;Darling&rsquo;. Two tracks later, here&rsquo;s Dave Grohl providing drums for the bittersweet straight-ahead rock of &lsquo;Honey&rsquo;. More than three months since the album&rsquo;s release, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how it works as well as it does. Like <em>Manic</em> the recipe and the dynamics at play are a mystery, but the results are inarguable.</p>
<h3 id="7-madlib--sound-ancestors">7. Madlib — <em>Sound Ancestors</em></h3>
<p>When MF DOOM passed toward the end of 2020, I found myself returning to one record in particular: 2004&rsquo;s <em>Madvillainy</em> colab between the late rapper and producer Madlib. In turn I had originally come to that record primarily via a 2005 EP of remixes by Four Tet. So, it felt like a circle completing itself in some way, to tune into <em>Sound Ancestors</em>. Here Kieran Hebden is on editing &amp; arranging duties, and the result is a constantly shifting soundscape of beats and interweaving vocal samples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to nearly enough instrumental hip-hop, with my most prominent touchstone being J Dilla&rsquo;s 2006 LP <em>Donuts</em> – a record I considered during last year&rsquo;s  effort to figure out my all time favourite albums. There&rsquo;s a nod to Dilla here (on &lsquo;Two For 2&rsquo;), and the highest compliment I can pay <em>Sound Ancestors</em> is that it&rsquo;s operating in the same rarefied air as that masterpiece.</p>
<h3 id="6-jade-bird--different-kinds-of-light">6. Jade Bird — <em>Different Kinds of Light</em></h3>
<p>I had been so impatient for a follow-up to Jade Bird&rsquo;s debut (2nd place on my list in 2019) that the universe decided to play a trick on me. Like many artists, her entire tour was postponed multiple times throughout the pandemic, including the shows to which I had tickets. My disappointment at missing my opportunity to see how she does it live was alleviated, however, when she scheduled a series of intimate album launch shows – one of them a literal three minute walk from my front door. That show, which was simply Bird solo with an acoustic guitar, proved beyond any doubt that she is the genuine article.</p>
<p>The self-titled debut album was <em>so</em> good that I had all but convinced myself it was impossible to follow up. In that respect, <em>Different Kinds of Light</em> proved me entirely wrong in the best way possible. Not only are there multiple songs here every bit as captivating as the cream of the first record, there&rsquo;s also an admirable sense of Bird expanding her sound – exploring further some of the avenues of country and Americana that the first record hinted at. Best song on the record? Pick anything beginning with an &lsquo;H&rsquo; and I won&rsquo;t argue.</p>
<h3 id="5-low--hey-what">5. Low — <em>Hey What</em></h3>
<p>Back when I gave Low 6th place on my 2018 list, for <em>Double Negative</em>, I remarked upon my ignorance of the band&rsquo;s substantial back catalogue, and suggested that it was an error I should fix. Well, I am ashamed to admit that I have not done that work. Instead, I waited until <em>Hey What</em> came out this September, to experience all over again the shocking power of their brand of colossal-sounding, meditatively paced rock.</p>
<p>For this recording at least, the band is now down to a duo (bassist Steve Garrington having departed last year). The interplay between Mimi Parker &amp; Alan Sparhawk (who are also married) is the band&rsquo;s defining strength however, particularly their exceptional vocal harmonies, which retain the power to soothe and stir even when under several layers of detuned, distorted cacophony.</p>
<p>Maybe a second truly exceptional album in a row will finally push me to go back and explore three decades of output. There&rsquo;s every chance Low could turn out to be one of my favourite bands.</p>
<h3 id="4-bachelor--doomin-sun">4. Bachelor — <em>Doomin' Sun</em></h3>
<p>Jay Som took top spot on my 2017 list for the exemplary lo-fi bedroom pop album <em>Everybody Works</em>; and Palehound I (shamefully) have no prior familiarity with. As such, I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to expect when coming to their collaboration: Bachelor. What I found was a half hour of subtle but raw interrogations of the complex textures of love between women. The sonic palate is less synth and a little more guitar-centric than Jay Som&rsquo;s solo work, but it&rsquo;s still operating in largely the same spaces as I found so magnetic from <em>Everybody Works</em> &amp; <em>Turn Into</em> (2016).</p>
<p>Above all, this project appears brimming with the energy of two likeminded musical souls, effortlessly complementing one another in telling shared stories. &lsquo;Back of My Hand&rsquo; is a declaration of admiration, powerful despite its relaxed flow. &lsquo;Sick of Spiralling&rsquo; is, in some respects, that song&rsquo;s flipside: fuelled by fear as well as love. To my mind though, the album&rsquo;s high point is the Pixies-meets-That Dog blur and buzz of &lsquo;Stay in the Car&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="3-priya-ragu--damnshestamil">3. Priya Ragu — <em>damnshestamil</em></h3>
<p>Thought and prayers to anyone who has to decide how to file this record by category. Opener &lsquo;Leaf High&rsquo; — as well as being an introduction to Ragu&rsquo;s soaring, honeyed voice — is an exemplary piece of low key soul with a hip-hop inflection. It also contains a lyric referencing &ldquo;paper planes&rdquo;, which I couldn&rsquo;t help but read as a sly nod to Maya Arulpragasam — aka MIA — with whom Ragu has in common both Tamil heritage and musical eclecticism.</p>
<p>Three minute pop gem &lsquo;Good Love 2.0&rsquo; has song-of-the-summer energy, and &lsquo;Lockdown&rsquo; is an infectious mix of R&amp;B and hip-hop across a South Asian-inflected beat. It shifts between adamant and euphoric with ease, an admirable trick that is also at work on one of the record&rsquo;s several highlights: &lsquo;Chicken Lemon Rice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgot About&rsquo; is a straight-ahead R&amp;B ballad of exceptional quality. Here, as elsewhere, some of Ragu&rsquo;s choices of vocal inflections remind me of no one more strongly than Janet Jackson – a comparison I do not make lightly. I am excited to see where she goes after a debut like this.</p>
<h3 id="2-turnstile--glow-on">2. Turnstile — <em>Glow On</em></h3>
<p>The number of guitar bands that excite me has certainly waned over the last decade or so, but alongside Biffy Clyro and a resurgent Deftones, Turnstile prove here that there&rsquo;s still plenty of life in the scene if you know where to find it. I certainly did not expect to be making <em>two</em> comparisons to Fugazi when writing this year&rsquo;s list, but just like with Moin, it&rsquo;s the Washington legends' influence that I hear as coal to Turnstile&rsquo;s roaring fire.</p>
<p>Turnstile&rsquo;s update to hardcore, however, is inflected with synth atmospherics and an armload of borrowings from other genres. It actively rejects hardcore&rsquo;s (often misguided) reputation for self-seriousness, partly by unashamedly embracing anthemics, whilst retaining the source material&rsquo;s commitment to volume and enthusiasm. <em>Glow On</em> is an exercise in loud, direct sincerity distilled into concentrated sub-three minute bursts of whatever-works rock.</p>
<p>PS. hearing guest Dev Hynes in a hardcore setting sent me back to Test Icicles' <em>For Screening Purposes</em> (14th on my list in 2005), and it&rsquo;s still a lot of fun.</p>
<h3 id="1-olivia-rodrigo--sour">1. Olivia Rodrigo — <em>SOUR</em></h3>
<p>Olivia has experienced a break-up, and her former boyfriend is now with someone else. This very specific scenario is the impetus behind at least seven songs on <em>SOUR</em>, making it a kind of concept album about a heartbreak tinged with feelings of anger and inadequacy.</p>
<p>Some of the guest writing credits give a hint of the sonic palate. Hayley Williams helps inject some Paramore power-pop into &lsquo;Good 4 U&rsquo;, and Taylor Swift&rsquo;s recent sensibilities are evident on &lsquo;1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back&rsquo;: a fragile piano ballad of surpassing beauty. Then there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Deja Vu&rsquo;, as powerfully self-assured as it is potently infused with bitterness — tellingly it was written by the superhero team-up of Rodrigo, Swift, and Annie Clark.</p>
<p>Honestly though, there is not a weak song here, and there are several that are truly world class; perhaps the best of all is the achingly vulnerable, yet steel-spined, &lsquo;Traitor&rsquo;. Unimpeachable song of the year material.</p>
<p>Ultimately, nothing can compete when a three minute pop gem goes off in my chest like a cherry bomb, and this year Olivia Rodrigo came armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>I came to Nathan Harris’s novel as the last of the thirteen titles longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize, and after it had dropped out of contention (its absence from the shortlist having been announced in September). I was delighted to find a novel at once enormously readable and admirably in tune with human feeling, which depicted a period too little investigated: the days immediately following the post-American Civil War emancipation of enslaved people.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In an <a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/episode/nathan-harris-the-sweetness-of-water/umc.cmc.5vznmcvigdm0i6ocpzno9hvji?showId=umc.cmc.5h8lbz88c6dbjm6suhviylcui">interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>, Harris says that part of his ambition with <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> was to tell a new facet of the history of enslavement and emancipation. Specifically, he wished to provide an experience for the reader akin to his own when first reading Edward P Jones’s novel <em>The Known World</em> (2003). Jones’s novel deals, in part, with the matter of Black people who owned slaves; it was something Harris had not previously considered, and a revelation that cast new light on a period of American history too often calcified into the dry repetition of fact.</p>
<p>Harris sets about his task by interweaving two little-told stories. The first, the lives of formerly-enslaved brothers Landry &amp; Prentiss; the second, a homosexual relationship between two civil war soldiers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Enriching these two narratives is a cast of vibrantly drawn characters, and a setting — the fictional town of Old Ox — as distinct and well-realised as any I’ve encountered in a novel for some time. All of which richness Harris employs to great effect in a novel endlessly generous in the gifts of its plot. <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> is replete with captivating action, compellingly told. This begins fairly early, when Harris develops the characters of George &amp; Isabelle, and then switches to their son’s point of view so as to offer the reader new insight. The plot, which builds gradually through an opening section more engaged in establishing the world of Old Ox, only gathers pace throughout – its author keeping a lot of irons in the fire. No sooner is the true nature of Caleb &amp; August’s relationship revealed to the reader, than Landry is murdered. Soon thereafter Prentiss is arrested, and then we switch to Isabelle confronting Clementine about George’s supposed infidelity. These are but some of the beats of the novel’s second act.</p>
<p>A cynical reader may be inclined to charge the novel with a reliance upon familiar character tropes and incident. Yes, this is a story featuring a corrupt sheriff, a pure-hearted prostitute, and hateful former enslavers. Rivers are forded and shots are fired. There is even an epic wildfire that plays at once like tragedy and allegory<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It is to Harris’s enormous credit that he uses these ingredients to tell an uncommon story, and one rich with human feeling. Likewise, in the previously mentioned interview, Harris acknowledges that he may be open to the accusation of having employed the trope of a white saviour. Part of his project, in <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> however, is to show the immediate effects of emancipation upon all manner of people: those freed, those who formerly enslaved them, and also those who would seek to help the formerly enslaved begin new lives. The novel is interested in the consequences for people like George, Isabelle, and Caleb, just as it is in the fates of Landry and Prentiss.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Harris is a gifted writer at the level of the sentence. Consider the poetry, and the talent for empathic insight, at work in this passage from the novel’s third chapter, depicting the moment in which the brothers are granted their freedom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notion of true emancipation had always seemed so fantastical that, were it to occur, Prentiss had expected the heralds of a bugle, rows of men in lockstep who would descend upon Majesty’s Palace like angels brought down to serve the aims of God himself. In the actual event it was nothing but a few young men in blue uniforms as scraggy as the clothes that Prentiss and Landry had on themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importantly, the author is also a skilful conductor of theme. In the same early chapter he introduces the concept of freedom as a distant place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it grew clear that the only path to a life worth living would be found elsewhere, where they might not have more but could not possibly have less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then carries this idea throughout the novel, in moments such as this from two-thirds of the way through the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prentiss retreated into himself. He knew how to live in his head. He’d made a similar journey every day in the fields, wandering in his mind’s eye to a place he’d never been, a place that was equal parts destination and idea. Elsewhere was the only name it carried. The barn beside George’s cabin was elsewhere; a patch of free ground up north was elsewhere; his mother was elsewhere; salvation was elsewhere; all those lives that passed outside the jail existed elsewhere (praise be to their good fortune); and a fate, any fate, other than the one that lay before him would be a perfectly fine road to elsewhere. The map, with all its many variations, was in his head, yet he knew quite well he would never make the journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way Harris builds towards Prentiss (&amp; Caleb) eventually fleeing the farm, in the hope of escaping their lot and finding better lives. I found it particularly inspired that once this occurs, we are given relatively little of what lies beyond the horizon for the pair; instead Harris lingers upon those who remain. Isabelle’s attempts to build something worthy of those whom she has lost (George and Landry, but also Caleb and Prentiss) is touching without undue sentimentality. Likewise, I felt palpably Prentiss’s longing for his absent mother. The novel is grounded enough not to reunite them, and yet it ends on a note of hope, as resilient as the new life conjured from Isabelle’s razed farm.<br>

<p>Having come to <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> as the final novel in my 2021 Booker Prize marathon (the sequencing almost entirely random, I should note), I’m saddened not to see it on the shortlist. It is every bit as vastly entertaining as Maggie Shipstead’s <em>Great Circle</em>, and more coherently thoughtful in conception of its world than Richard Powers’s comparatively laboured <em>Bewilderment</em>. No special consideration should be owed to debut novels, of course, but Harris’s is a remarkably impressive achievement – whatever follows will certainly be worthy of close attention.</p>

NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><em>The Promise</em> is an ambitious novel, encompassing the stories of the lives (and deaths) of two generations of the Swart family. Its spine transcribes the long arc between the making, and the keeping, of the titular promise: that a particular property on the family’s land be given to their maid. It is a novel rich with insight into South African history, and which makes exemplary use of an intriguing cast of central characters to paint a wider picture of injustice, fallibility, and unfulfilled ambition.</p>
<p>The central story of the novel is captivating enough, but the book’s standout aspect is the manner in which it is narrated. Galgut has chosen to write from a perspective not constrained to multiple first-persons, or even free indirect third-person, but which also stops somewhere short of omniscience. Early in the novel the narrator mistakenly uses the word ‘hearse’ before correcting itself to ‘house’. Not long after comes the first of several direct references to the reader, telling us that one of the novel’s characters ‘dislikes her whole body, as many of you do’. It is narration with personality, as interested in seemingly minor detail as it is in the lives of the central characters. As the novel progresses, it is never less than impressive to see how Galgut affects transitions between perspective with minimal friction. In an <a href="https://youtu.be/LrcIkgkLLew">interview with Europa Editions</a>, Galgut says that this form of narrative perspective shifting was partly inspired by work he had been doing on a screenplay. The process, he says, taught him that ‘a narrator could act like a camera’. As adapted to the page, however, it also takes on an aspect of interiority which evades the cinematic lens. We are given a rich depiction of an interior funeral scene, before we skip for a beat into the perspective of the family’s dog. During a city scene, the novel takes a diversion from its central cast to inhabit the unusual vantage of a (possibly mentally ill) homeless man.</p>
<p>I will admit that my initial impression of this technique was to become overly preoccupied with the <em>identity</em> of the narrator. As I settled into the text, however, I came to recognise that Galgut was employing a variation on narrative techniques familiar from the height of the modernist novel. The blurring and leaking of perspective allows the novel to breach barriers, pushing beyond what its characters know, and also beyond the constraints of the immediate narrative. In the aforementioned interview, Galgut speaks of the way in which he feels that South African literature is freighted with the expectation: ‘no matter how small your story it has to carry the weight of the country’s history’. In this there is an echo of JM Coetzee’s comment that the country’s letters represent a ‘literature in bondage’. We might read Galgut’s shaping of narrative perspective as an attempt to wrestle with that burden, and to free itself — in some respect — from those shackles. In his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/18/the-promise-by-damon-galgut-review-legacies-of-apartheid">review for <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Jon Day found that it fell short in some respects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the results are mixed, this might be because the novel sometimes strives too hard to present a balanced collective perspective, or because it fails to reconcile aesthetic with moral questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, I found the manner in which the novel is written to be enormously effective, and I felt this lack of neat reconciliation to represent a deliberate admission of difficulty and complexity. By offering us a ceaseless chorus of contributing perspectives, Galgut succeeds in conveying the fact that the context is far larger than any one story can encompass. As James Wood puts it in his <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/19/a-family-at-odds-reveals-a-nation-in-the-throes">review of the novel for <em>The New Yorker</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Galgut’s narrator has the authority of omniscience, it’s used lightly, glancingly, so that this perilous all-knowingness often makes his characters not more transparent but more mysterious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were individual moments when I felt that the novel’s voice attempted something overly cute, or too arch. One example comes at the novel’s culmination, when the narrator takes aim at Galgut’s ending, calling the use of pathetic fallacy a ‘cheap, redemptive symbol’. These instances when I acutely felt the wink at the reader were, however, very few in comparison to the times when I was deeply impressed by Galgut’s command of perspective and tone.<br>

<p>By virtue of the context in which I read <em>The Promise</em>, I am drawn to make comparison with another title shortlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize: Anuk Arudpragasam’s <em>A Passage North</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Like Galgut, Arudpragasam skilfully utilises his protagonist as a starting point to examine a country’s evolving political circumstances (in this case Sri Lanka), and the manner in which they impact individual lives. <em>A Passage North</em> is a quieter novel, more content to linger upon certain of its questions. By comparison, Galgut (or, at least his narrator) often seems eager to move on to the next perspective, digression, or time period. To my mind, it makes for an interesting contrast in technique, and does nothing to disparage either work.</p>

NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The thirteenth novel by Richard Powers – his first since the Booker-shortlisted, and Pulitzer-winning <em>The Overstory</em> (2018) – is a meditation on climate disaster, personal responsibility, and empathy. It is a novel that plays out at various scales, from a relationship between father and son, to the arena of national policymaking, to the circumstances of imagined life on theoretical planets. Powers is certainly a gifted writer, and he is possessed of both a vast imagination and an impressively thorough command of facts. However, I found that several elements of the novel frustrated me, from the way its characters are drawn, to the tone and manner in which its overall narrative is composed.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the caveat that this may all be subjective to my own experience, I’ll begin with the textual, stylistic elements of <em>Bewilderment</em> that irked me. The most common was the myriad ways in which Powers awkwardly introduces facts about the natural world (or the universe more broadly) into the text, through Theo’s narration. In contrast to his relatable concern for his son, and his grieving for his late wife, these interjections repeatedly struck me as off key. Not only did it feel unlikely that anyone genuinely <em>thinks</em> in these hyper-specific bursts of rational fact, it began to feel like the work of the text to convey information rather than story or feeling. It read as though Powers, in his research, had uncovered dozens of things he found so fascinating that he couldn’t stand to leave them out of the text. The result was that I sometimes found Theo’s narration unrealistic and disappointingly flat. Take, as one example, the way in which he relays a simple taxi journey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt us traveling on a small craft, piloting through the capital city of the reigning global superpower on the coast of the third largest continent of a smallish, rocky world near the inner rim of the habitable zone of a G-type dwarf star that lay a quarter of the way out to the edge of a dense, large, barred, spiral galaxy that drifted through a thinly spread local cluster in the dead center of the entire universe. (p210)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reads like a particularly erudite teenager trying too hard to impress: to overwhelm with fact. In Powers’ case it is more likely an effort to reveal to the reader some of his narrator’s interior, but I found it no more convincing (and no less irritating) each time something like it occurred.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with the character of Robin. Particularly in the second act of the novel — as he is changed by his treatment away from a recognisably petulant nine year old, into someone preternaturally empathetic and knowledgeable — he began to function in the text similarly to Leonard Stecyk in David Foster Wallace’s <em>The Pale King</em> (2011): a character whose flawless, self-possessed <em>goodness</em> is matched only by how irritating everyone else finds him. Unlike in Wallace’s novel, however, this is almost certainly not how Powers wants his reader to feel about Robin.</p>
<p>Similarly, I found the rendering of Aly to be cartoonishly simple. She is written as an unimpeachable font of altruism and empathy, devoid of human flaws. Her absence, which is required by the plot, nevertheless read to me as a device by which to sustain her sainthood. In the world of the novel, and specifically in the eyes of Theo and Robin, nothing short of Aly’s martyrdom will suffice. It is the impossible, impractical standard against which everyone else in the text is found wanting.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All of which brings me to the broader issues I had with <em>Bewilderment</em>: the ways in which it is confused by its telescoping sense of scale, and – most strikingly – its pervasive sense of pessimism.</p>
<p>The ambitious manner in which the novel moves back and forth between the scales of the family and the intergalactic is admirable, but it also works to the novel’s detriment in one important regard. By counterpointing Aly’s obsession with practical solutions to present problems, and Theo’s focus on theoretical explorations of unreachably distant worlds, the novel becomes confused about its stakes. What does it matter whether or not Theo can help his son, if Earth will be uninhabitable by the time Robin is a man? And what does Earth’s accelerating climate disaster really matter in the grander scale of the observable universe? These are fascinating questions, which I found <em>Bewilderment</em> willing to ask, but unwilling to venture answers to. I came away frustrated by the manner in which <em>Bewilderment</em> raises problems at all scales, without offering hope that they might be effectively addressed.</p>
<p>In fact, the novel’s repeated hammering on humanity’s failings, and the consequences thereof, becomes increasingly depressing. <em>Bewilderment</em> is shot through with pessimism not just in the beat-to-beat litany of personal, familial, and bureaucratic shortcomings, but also in the shape of its plot as a whole. There is certainly something captivating and bittersweet in much of Robin’s arc. His rising out of the prison of his own volatile emotions into beatific empathy, only to decline once more when his treatment becomes unavailable, reminded me of Oliver Sacks’s <em>Awakenings</em> (1973)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. However, Powers chooses to end <em>Bewilderment</em> with Robin’s death. It is presented, alongside the cancellation of the NextGen project and therefore the scuppering of Theo’s life’s work, as a one-two punch that leaves the reader in no doubt as to the message Powers is sending – a pessimism of empathy, politics, and purpose that felt depressing to read.</p>
<p>In a 2018 review for <em>The Atlantic</em>, Nathaniel Rich noted the dour outlook of Powers’ previous novel, <em>The Overstory</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Humankind is deeply ill, […] The species won’t last long.” This is the consensus among Powers’s characters, and it’s a darkly optimistic one. Optimistic for the planet, pessimistic for the fate of humanity. Once man clears out, nature will return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same assessment could be made of <em>Bewilderment</em>. Whilst it is to be lauded for its willingness to look directly at the most difficult and colossal of problems, the novel is too analytical, and too trenchantly rational in its perspective, to inspire. It lacks poetry, most notably through its narrative voice, but also more widely in the construction of its narrative.</p>
<p>In one throwaway moment a fellow ‘planet-hunter’ remarks to Theo that he is lucky to have a son like Robin: “I can’t understand why my boys love <em>Star Wars</em> more than they love the stars.” (p219) One possible answer is that <em>Star Wars</em> —like a lot of fantasy, and like much of the sci-fi Theo professes to enjoy — is a story of hope. Such stories have captivated the human imagination, and served as sources of inspiration, for centuries. As well composed as it is, I can’t imagine <em>Bewilderment</em> inspiring much besides apathy or despair.</p>

<p>It is a more difficult thing in many respects, for the writer to base events and characters in a novel upon real people and real occurrences. When inventing from whole cloth, there is no burden upon the author to maintain accuracy, or to do justice to those who once lived. Indeed, the people and events depicted in Nadifa Mohamed’s <em>The Fortune Men</em> are yet within living memory, still further freighting her novel with responsibilities not incumbent upon those novels wholly invented.</p>
<p>Fortunately (no pun intended), Mohamed is a gifted writer and a subtle stylist. She is engaged — in <em>The Fortune Men</em> — with telling the story of Mahmood Mattan: a Somali man who lived in Cardiff, where he was wrongfully accused of, and eventually hanged for, the murder of a local shopkeeper in 1952. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/MkrR0-MPKzw">piece for Waterstones</a>, Mohamed says that with her novel she ‘tried to touch hands with who Mahmood might really have been’. She does so by employing an admirable gift for empathy, bringing forth a wholly realised sense of many of the novel’s characters with nuanced phrasing. Mahmood, as vital and solid a presence as he is in the text, exists in Cardiff as ‘a human silhouette in motion’, marginalised because of his nationality, race, and class. In a novel very much concerned with one’s sense of place and belonging, Mahmood’s romantic relationship ‘has fixed him in his longitude and latitude’. And Mohamed is just as gifted at depicting place through powerfully evocative use of simile and metaphor. She writes of the river that ‘brooded beneath the bridges, black and muscular’, and door locks that go ‘click, clack […] like small bones breaking’.</p>
<p>Indeed, the weakest aspect of <em>The Fortune Men</em> is the extended section of directly reported speech that makes up Mahmood’s trial. This stylistic choice certainly does something to convey feelings of helplessness and unfairness that characterise the proceedings. However, I was left feeling that I was being deprived of Mahmood’s significant talents for description and interiority, on display throughout the majority of the novel.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <em>The Fortune Men</em> is a beautifully written fictionalisation of a tragedy, thick with unresolved questions about national identities, and ideas of belonging. Beyond even that, it is a deceptively ambitious novel, which expands to include the Jewish ancestry of the murder victim’s family, beginning to interrogate the diversity and commonalities of the immigrant experience. By bringing forth a vivid depiction of an all-too-recent miscarriage of justice, Mohamed — the first British-Somali to find a place on the Booker Prize shortlist — also attempts to grapple with the myriad ways in which identity can still shape circumstance in modern Britain. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/09/nadifa-mohamed-modern-day-britain-is-intense">Interviewed in <em>The Guardian</em></a> recently, she framed it in terms of her own desire for understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern-day Britain is intense. Something strange is happening [and] whatever postcolonial psychosis it is is so mad and so extreme. Being black, being Muslim, being someone who up until quite recently thought that they understood this country, I’m desperate to understand what’s going on.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The opening section of Francis Spufford’s excellent novel <em>Light Perpetual</em> brings to mind the experimental fiction of Nicholson Baker, and specifically <em>Mezzanine</em> (1988), a book that unfolds entirely within the duration of an escalator ride. Here, Spufford distills a moment down into its constituent parts, slicing them ever thinner as though in an effort to prevent the V2 rocket that is destined to destroy the New Cross Road branch of Woolworths, from ever landing. Ultimately, however, the tragic fact of history will not be denied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This instant – this interval of time, measurably tiny, immeasurably vast – arrives unwitnessed, passes unwitnessed, ends unwitnessed. (p5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This impressive piece of writing provides a somewhat misleading opening to what thereafter unfolds as a novel in a fairly standard realist mode. It is, however, a necessary one, giving a frame to Spufford’s project of bringing forth from real rubble a set of invented lives, and through them providing expertly-rendered tableaus of 20th century London<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an interview for the Hay Festival, Spufford references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(film_series)">Michael Apted’s <em>Up</em> series</a> of documentaries as one point of reference for his model. In those films, as in <em>Light Perpetual</em>, the audience is granted a series of windows into the lives of several individuals, at intervals – intervening years illuminated only by the glow of the glimpsed present. This technique of temporally constraining the narrative can’t help but call to mind totemic works such as Woolf’s <em>The Waves</em> (1931), and Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> (1922). Free from such unfair comparisons however, Spufford’s novel deserves praise for its many strengths.</p>
<p>I found some of the most impressive sections to be those chronicling Ben’s struggles with acute, pervasive anxiety. It’s an unsettling portrait of compulsion and fear, and a bravura piece of writing. Indeed, Spufford shows no signs of faltering with any of the novel’s narratives: Alec’s comparatively less fraught journey from print worker to head teacher is rich throughout with considered observations and human feeling<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. At the sentence level too, Spufford is consistently strong, and sometimes spectacular. Consider the concision and richness of this introduction for a minor character:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trevor is six foot three and won a heavyweight title while he was in the merchant navy. He is also a deacon in the Joyful Assemblies of the Holy Spirit: but he doesn’t feel he is under an obligation to spell out his commitment to the path of heavenly peace in situations where the greater good would be served by keeping shtum. (p102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this meditation, one of many that touch upon the novel’s central theme of what <em>might</em> have been for any one of us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then just as suddenly, just as clear, she thinks: so what. Nobody chooses who they love. Possessing something, being somebody, loving anyone, it rules the rest out, and so it’s quieter than being young, and looking forward, and expecting it all, that’s all. The world calms down when your choice is made. (p297)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My only real criticism of the writing was the occasional use of a technique that is one of my literary bugbears: the describing of (particularly non-white) skin colour by way of comparison to foods. It is always irksome, but sits particularly awkwardly here, in a novel that features a character suffering with a pronounced phobia of cannibalism.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the whole, <em>Light Perpetual</em> is tender without being sentimental. It is interested in both the overarching shape of a life and the seemingly banal minutiae that comprise it. Spufford refrains from providing easy solutions to the real, complex issues with which his characters are faced<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. He does not rescue them from their collective premature demise in order to grant them easy, uncomplicated lives. His aim is to explore the myriad paths that may have lay ahead, and which were so brutally truncated. In doing so he expertly weaves some parallel threads through the lives of several of his characters, without ever making it feel showy or heavy-handed. There is, for example, the repeated presence of music: the gospel that Ben is moved by in church; Jo’s career as both performer and teacher; Vern’s refuge in opera. As the characters’ lives lengthen, the reader begins to tease out these universalities in a satisfying way that also enforces the novel’s purpose.</p>
<p>The novel ends with Francis Spufford achieving a delicate balance between evoking the colossal, unknowable, randomness of life to which every person is subject, and simultaneously finding a way to express unequivocally that each one of those lives is unique and important. It’s a very fine piece of writing at every level, and one to which I will return.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I should mention that, particularly before it expanded its horizons somewhat (sending Jo to LA, and Vern to Glyndebourne), another of the works that <em>Light Perpetual</em> brought to mind for me, was an experimental, illustrated book by Iain Sinclair &amp; Dave McKean, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Chocolate_Autopsy"><em>Slow Chocolate Autopsy: Incidents from the Notorious Career of Norton, Prisoner of London</em></a> (1997).

			 <p>Last week we spent a few days on the Welsh coast, at a place named Moylegrove — a little south of Cardigan. We were staying in a birch shepherd’s hut, part way down one of the narrowest, twistiest roads I’ve ever encountered, in an area where GPS, data services, and phone signal of any kind feared to tread.</p>
<p>We managed to fit quite a bit into the days, visiting Cardigan, Tenby, Fishguard, an Iron Age settlement, and a five-millennia old burial mound of standing stones. We also spent time walking the Stackpole Loop (Stackpole Quay → Barafundle Bay → Stackpole Head → Broad Haven → Bosherton Lily Pools), the area near Strumble Head lighthouse, and more of the coast at Ceibwr Bay.</p>
<p>The lack of any form of signal in our hut shaped our evenings. We played card games, listened to BBC 6Music Radio, and read paperbacks with mugs of hot chocolate at hand.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Patricia Lockwood’s extraordinary debut novel  <em>No One Is Talking About This</em>  is a book about what it’s like to live a substantial portion of one’s life online, and about the ways in which the internet has changed the manner of our being in the world. It’s also a book about what it’s like to experience something revelatory and wonderful — and also tragic and painful — at the scale of one’s family life, and how such an experience can change one’s understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Lockwood is an exceptional writer. Her work in poetry has sharpened her ability to render in language both a moment and its emotional valence: an idea as well as a sense of the absurdity or profundity of it. This, coupled with an unerring eye for the perfect detail and a talent for conjuring crystalline metaphors, leaves the reader with the impression that she is uncannily able to tease out the very heart of an emotional knot – to lay its hidden truths bare as though they were obvious. And, whilst there is certainly narrative and incident, <em>No One Is Talking About This</em> is primarily a novel of tone and feeling. It is never less than captivating to watch Lockwood find and maintain that rarest pitch: a perfect harmony of humour, melancholy, and raw emotional vulnerability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The pathos of <em>No One Is Talking About This</em> is exquisitely rendered – it is as saddening as it is laugh-out-loud funny, and often in the very same paragraph.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A lot of writing about life online falls short in one important respect or another. It is either ignorant of the realities of online discourse — content instead to rely on broad or outdated cliché — or it adopts an arch tone that seeks to elevate the protagonist (and hence the author and reader) above the participants. Lockwood’s prose, whilst certainly still <em>knowing</em>, is understanding and interested. She is enthusiastic about the myriad joys of participation in social networks, often employing ‘you’ &amp; ‘we’ as indefinite pronouns when writing of actions her protagonist takes online. It’s a subtle, effective evocation of the eerie sense of simultaneous communality and anonymity that life online can engender. Later in the novel — after a shift has occurred in the protagonist’s perspective — the technique seems to take on an almost anthropological note, as though seeking to explain the otherwise mysterious actions of a culture aeons distant. In an <a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/miscellaneous-files-patricia-lockwood/">interview with <em>Guernica</em> magazine</a>, Lockwood frames her work in terms of the realist social novel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t seem that different to be translating your encounter with the Ted Cruz porn tweet than it does to be translating your encounter with a croissant breakfast in Paris after your balls have been shot off in the war. You are talking about eating something, drinking something, opening the newspaper, watching people pass. You are choosing either a fine or a coarse grain of description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting to look at <em>No One Is Talking About This</em>, with its melding of forms, as a retooling of the social novel for the present moment. There is a sense that some elements of the novel exist within a <em>very</em> specific and narrow window. (For how long will the average reader grok references to Harambe, for example?) But, this in itself is reflective of the ephemeral nature of life online. In an <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/02/patricia-lockwood-interview-debut-novel-no-one-is-talking-about-this.html">interview with <em>Slate</em></a>, Lockwood refers to the ‘boundedness’ of the novel as a form, as an important contrast to the endlessness of the internet. So, this is a novel that knows about Trump, but not about COVID-19. In years to come it may take on new life as a piece of historical reportage about what it was like to use the social internet, very specifically, in the period 2016-2019.</p>
<p>At the heart of the novel’s (kinda, sorta) diptych construction is the question of whether the forms of the social web allow for serious expression. In an <a href="https://youtu.be/Nnv5eyE7QbA">interview with <em>The London Review of Books</em></a>, Lockwood considers the ways in which her novel examines the limitations of ‘a pre-received form’ of language that has come to characterise many of the internet’s social spaces. ‘As the forms become rigid, masks do appear’ she says of the manner in which the accepted forms of expression on social networks (in particular) limit how and what participants can express. <em>No One Is Talking About This</em> captures the sound and feeling of two great ice sheets butting up against one another: the sardonic, quixotic, ephemeral churn of the modern connected world; and the enormity and complexity of life’s events more widely. The attempt to say something <em>important</em> or deeply felt about one’s own life, running up against the predominant tones and forms of online spaces. As she phrases it in the aforementioned <em>Guernica</em> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do spend so much of our time online, putting things out there, trying to be funny or sound smart. It can be nice to put something up and say, “I have a big serious life thing on the other side of the screen, too.” My mom passed away last year, and I posted photos of her every so often as a reminder: She lived, this happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>LRB</em> interview, Lockwood says that whilst writing she thought often of a line in George Elliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, what she calls ‘the diffuse pain of the portal’ is that no one knows where their attention should be in any one moment. It is a place comprising (<a href="https://genius.com/Bo-burnham-welcome-to-the-internet-lyrics">in the words of Bo Burnham</a>) ‘a little bit of everything, all of the time’. <em>No One Is Talking About This</em> contrasts this against the focussing power of personal tragedy. The novel introduces us to a narrator who swims adroitly in the fast-flowing river of online life, before refocussing to encompass life offline: wider, more emotionally diverse, more implacably difficult.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>No One Is Talking About This</em> is a truly extraordinary accomplishment. It is a vital, timely novel that affords us the opportunity to ask important questions about the role of the internet in our lives.</p>
<p>In the Slate interview mentioned above, Lockwood (b. 1982) characterises herself as being ‘from the perfect internet generation, and you can put that in a pull quote because this is very important’. It may well be the case that I responded to this novel so strongly in part because I’m from that same micro-generation: a cohort of people who had a pre-internet childhood, for whom the advent of social networks came in their late adolescence or early adulthood. <em>No One Is Talking About This</em> encapsulates both what I love about the internet, and also many of the ways in which it frustrates, disappoints, and constrains us. The inability of the ubiquitous digital sphere — with its aversion to depth, seriousness, nuance, complexity, and raw human feeling — to cope with vital parts of our lives, deserves attention. That Lockwood has addressed it with a novel both hilarious and deeply moving is nothing short of masterful.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sir Kazuo Ishiguro is the only previous winner on this year’s Booker Prize longlist<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and I come to his novel — <em>Klara and the Sun</em> — in the week that it was cut from the running, having not made <a href="https://thebookerprizes.com/the-final-six-novels">the shortlist</a>. Nevertheless, it seems likely that this will be one of the most widely read of the current Booker crop, and it is a strong novel. In the final analysis, however, it didn’t shock me to find it missing from the shortlist, as I think it falls short of Ishiguro’s finest work in a couple of key ways.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a 2015 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/27/kazuo-ishiguro-reading-group">interview with <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Kazuo Ishiguro is quoted as saying “I tend to write the same book over and over, or at least, I take the same subject I took last time out and refine it, or do a slightly different take on it.” The example that he offers for this is (his Booker Prize winning novel) <em>The Remains of the Day</em> (1989), which he refers to as a “remake” of <em>Artist of the Floating World</em> (1986). Ishiguro frames both novels, despite their distinct settings, as works about what it means to waste one’s life: be it professional, personal, or romantic.</p>
<p>Much of the commentary around <em>Klara and the Sun</em> has figured the novel as a kind of ‘remake’ of 2005’s <em>Never Let Me Go</em> (2005). Both books fall within the broad category of literary science fiction, and both have at their heart shared questions around humanity. In a 2008 interview for <em>The Paris Review</em>, Ishiguro said this of why he chose to use clones as the protagonists in <em>Never Let Me Go</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the attractions about using clones is that it makes people ask immediately, What does it mean to be a human being? It’s a secular route to the Dostoyevskian question, What is a soul? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, he is asking similar questions with this new novel, and approaching the subject from a slightly different angle. In <em>Klara and the Sun</em> the narration is from the perspective of the titular character, who is an artificial consciousness in a mechanical body<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Klara’s voice, as narrator, is pleasant and even, though the reader becomes increasingly aware of the ways in which she sees the world differently from those around her. I was reminded, in places, of Mark Haddon’s <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em> (2003), which is narrated by a neurodiverse boy, whose perception of the world shapes the text to a large extent.</p>
<p>With novels in this mode it becomes the reader’s task to parse some of what is happening <em>through</em> the filter of how the narrator is experiencing it. In Klara’s case, we learn some of the peculiarities of how her vision works; we find that she is fond of specifics (particularly around things like measured dimensions and age); and we slowly grow accustomed to the fact that there are significant gaps in her understanding of the world. This form of narration is something of a double-edged sword in <em>Klara and the Sun</em>. It was certainly interesting to experience the world through a different lens, and to see how Klara perceives the places, people, and circumstances with which she comes into contact. However, increasingly I felt the absence of a dependable baseline of experience against which to make comparison. Unlike Haddon’s novel, for example, which is set in a recognisable turn-of-the-millennium Wiltshire, the reader necessarily <em>cannot</em> come to Ishiguro’s novel with any prior knowledge. This is a world of Artificial Friends and children who are ‘lifted’; the reader’s wish to understand the intricacies of these things is often frustrated by either the narrator’s ignorance of them, her misunderstanding of them, or her lack of interest in them.</p>
<p>When an author chooses to present a unique world in first-person perspective, there will always be the question of how much explanatory work the narrator is expected to perform. It is a characteristic of many pure fantasy novels, for instance, that a first-person narrator is burdened not only with telling their own story, but also with explaining the nuances of a peculiar world to the reader. The opposite, as employed by Ishiguro here, is to have a narrator unaware (or uninterested) in their role as tour guide, who leaves the reader largely in the dark as to how the world of the novel functions. It becomes part of the work of reading the novel, in these cases, to piece together the concrete particulars of the book’s world. It will likely be a matter of individual readers’ tastes as to how well they feel this is handled in <em>Klara and the Sun</em>. To my mind Ishiguro is operating a couple of steps beyond a level of obscurity that could have provided a richer experience. In the aforementioned <em>Paris Review</em> piece, Ishiguro says this of his writing style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most writers have certain things that they decide quite consciously, and other things they decide less consciously. In my case, the choice of narrator and setting are deliberate. You do have to choose a setting with great care, because with a setting come all kinds of emotional and historical reverberations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By passing a world necessarily foreign to the reader through the somewhat distorted lens of Klara’s perception, I felt as though Ishiguro had deprived us of the means by which to truly know the world of his novel.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also felt an uneasy tension in the construction and tone of the narrative. It is as though Ishiguro is not wholly decided as to whether or not the novel is to be read as allegory<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One particular plot beat, for example, has an almost fairytale-like neatness. A character is conspicuously present who happens to possess the specialist knowledge required to effectively sabotage a particular machine. To compound this, the manner of sabotage happens to require a ‘special liquid’ which would be difficult to obtain were it not for the fact that it is also contained within the workings of Klara’s mechanical body. It is as though Ishiguro is too invested in furthering particular threads of plot, to worry about whether the action feels at all likely within the frame of his story.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is an irksome disparity between the function that some of the novel’s human characters ultimately wish for Klara to perform, and the reader’s clear understanding that she will not be capable of it. This is an instance in which the reader possesses greater clarity about Klara’s inner life than any of the humans who surround her can. To them, her simulacrum of a human being is often near-perfect; they do not know that her grasp of spatial awareness is so poor that she believes the Sun goes to rest at night in a particular building behind which it sets. When the novel raises questions about the distance between a human girl and an approximation of a human girl, it might frustrate the reader – who alone knows that Klara believes all the pollution in the world to be caused by one machine – that some characters in the novel believe it to be a negligible, bridgeable gap<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded for a <em>body</em> of work, with particular reason given for why the recipient was chosen. In Ishiguro’s case, when he was awarded the 2017 Prize, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2017/press-release/">the Academy said</a> that he has ‘in novels of great emotional force… uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world’. It is certainly possible to see this latest novel — his first since having been awarded the Nobel Prize — as a continuation of that project. And it is certainly a fascinating, immensely readable entry in that discourse.</p>
<p>Much of the above may read as though I did not enjoy <em>Klara and the Sun</em>, and that is not at all the case. Ishiguro is a masterful writer, with a deceptively simple prose style, and he is able to sustain the reader’s interest paragraph-to-paragraph and chapter-to-chapter with admirable ease. My complaints largely amount to subjective arguments about stylistic choices, and it is quite possible they may prove to be peculiarities of my own reading. It may well be the case that an approach to the novel that took it primarily as allegorical would find it all the more satisfying.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, after an indistinct passage of years has passed, there is a scene in which a roboticist explains to Klara (and thus the reader) that developments in artificial consciousness have outstripped human understanding. In turn, this has led to fear amongst people about the growing capabilities of non-biological minds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They’re afraid because they can’t follow what’s going on inside any more. They can see what you do. They accept that your decisions, your recommendations, are sound and dependable, almost always correct. But they don’t like not knowing how you arrive at them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, I found <em>Klara and the Sun</em> to be a very enjoyable and tenderly composed novel, which was somewhat at odds with its depiction of the functioning of its narrator’s artificial consciousness.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>A great deal of caution is required when discussing books in this genre space, to avoid using terms that may have specific connotations within the world of the novel. We might think of Klara, broadly, as an Artificial Intelligence, or say that she is an android, but these are not terms that the novel employs, and their absence is evidently a choice on the author’s part.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This is the sixth novel I’ve read as part of the 2021 Booker Prize longlist marathon, and the first that has not been a pleasant reading experience. That isn’t intended in an entirely pejorative sense, since Karen Jennings is certainly aiming – with some elements of <em>An Island</em> – to make the reader uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The narrative moves back and forth between an undated present and past in the life of its protagonist: Samuel. In doing so, the novel gives a wider picture of the misery and loss he has endured before ending up alone on a desolate island where he serves as lighthouse keeper. When the introduction of an unnamed man breaks decades of Samuel’s solitude, the reader comes to realise that his presence represents not just a dramatic change in Samuel’s life, but an opportunity to atone for some mistakes of his past.</p>

<p>John Donne’s ‘Meditation XVII’, to which the title of Karen Jennings’s novel can’t help but allude, is an expression of common humanity, in which Donne expresses the human condition in terms of shared suffering:</p>

<p>No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; any man&rsquo;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is certainly open to the charge of being morbid, but it is ultimately a hopeful work that revels in the universality of the human experience, including that of mortal death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, I found <em>An Island</em> to be an unrelentingly pessimistic work, such that it leaves the reader feeling that it has nothing much to say. The most significant difference, I found, was a complete absence of faith in Jennings’s novel.</p>
<p>The locus of faith in Donne’s work is in the Christian God — Donne was, after all, an Anglican priest at the time of composing <em>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</em> (1623) — but <em>An Island</em> also calls to mind the works of staunch atheist Samuel Beckett. In plays such as <em>Waiting for Godot</em> (1952) and <em>Endgame</em> (1957), Beckett has pairs of characters marooned in unforgiving environs, with little hope for the future. In these works — though the characters may be loathe to admit it — faith is found in the human spirit’s endurance, and the stubborn will to survive. Despite stark settings and pitch dark subjects, these are plays of humour that find warmth in the natures of their characters, and in their interactions. <em>An Island</em>, by contrast, seemed to me entirely cynical. It lacks any sense whatsoever of a universal order, but it also refuses to replace it with any sense of faith in its characters’ humanity, or in humanity generally.</p>
<p>The scope of the narrative, for instance, encompasses several eras of governance for its unnamed country. A revolution for independence replaces a colonial power with a President; the President is later overthrown in favour of a Dictator, and so on. Throughout, there are physical changes to some parts of the unnamed city, but the lives of the people barely change, and the slums do not improve, they only grow in size. Likewise, the novel has no faith in the power of people, or political activism, to engender meaningful change. Any sense of hope that a character experiences is quickly undercut by another, promising that it is futile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woman smiled, but the man said, “It was like this for us too, uncle. I’m sorry to tell you that. We were exactly like you.”<br>
Samuel’s father laughed. “No, my friend, that isn’t possible. This is a free and democratic country. We’re independent, we have it all now. There will be no problems here. Your country did it the wrong way, you made mistakes.”<br>
“Wait, uncle. You will see.” (p74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, when Samuel is moved to directly participate in frustrating for change, he too is quickly disillusioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The march could not be stopped. Not this tide of men and women who would no longer be told how to live. They had given up fear. They knew only strength.<br>
Only afterwards, in the first interrogation room, did he learn that the march had been poorly attended, with little more than two thousand people participating. The event had barely disrupted the peace, and though hundreds had died and many more were arrested, it had made no impact at all. (p94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as the works of groups are depicted as ineffectual, so the novel also has no faith in the ability of individuals to meaningfully change. Towards the end of the book, Jennings has reduced her elderly protagonist to little more than paranoia and base impulse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He thought only of that word he had spoken down in the stone hut: violence – though now he uttered another world altogether, “Mine.” He stood up from where he had been kneeling. And again, “Mine” as he grabbed the knife out of the man’s hand. “Mine, mine, mine!” (p98)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act of violence on which the novel ends is but the latest in a depressing, predictable sequence. It serves as but one more example in the novel of violence rendered in response to violence, and accomplishing nothing.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One might expect that in a novel so pessimistic about humanity, notes of optimism might be found in the depiction of nature. Instead, the natural world is often shown in <em>An Island</em> not as a force for rejuvenation, but as an adversary to be guarded against. Often, unsurprisingly in the world of the novel, this requires some form of violence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he manipulated the weed with lit matches, watching it twist and shrivel, not stopping until he was certain enough damage had been done that it would never grow again. (p15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At best, nature is sometimes shown to hold the power of erasure; for the most part, like the man-made change of the novel, much of what the natural world offers is bad and getting worse. A late scene depicts what at first seems to be a miraculous natural event: the annual arrival of giant crabs to the island. Quickly, however, the beauty of the event is undermined. The crabs (just like the island’s hens) attack one another, before the humans also attack the crabs. Next the reader is told of how precipitously the crab populations have declined, and how the small crabs that remain taste comparatively awful. If the sequence fails to depress, it is only because by this point in the novel the reader has likely been numbed into expecting nothing else.<br>

<p>Much of the above may have been more palatable to me, had I felt that the novel had something to say about a specific time, place, or culture. Instead, I felt that Jennings’s choice to make her novel purely an allegory robbed it of any chance of making meaningful political statements. Take, for example, this exchange, which is typical of the book’s political discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But you don’t agree with the idea of fighting against tyranny? You support the Dictator?” asked Big Ro.<br>
“No, I’m not saying that. I know about opposing power. My father was amongst those who fought for independence.” (pp78-79)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whom among us <em>would</em> support ‘the Dictator’? What does it mean to ‘oppose power’, or ‘fight for independence’? The novel is so determined to remain entirely allegorical that it absolutely refuses to be specific about any of these matters. Samuel’s political awakening is also rendered in similarly cursory terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They went to regular meetings, passed worn paperbacks between them in which they read theories of how to create a better world and life. They recited quotes from the texts, argued over words and phrases. At the meetings they rose, made speeches. (p91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.litnet.co.za/an-island-by-joanne-hichens-an-interview/">interview for LitNet</a>, Jennings explicitly frames her responsibility as a novelist so as to exclude the need to answer any of the questions she poses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My job as a writer is to hold a mirror up to these realities, but it is not within my abilities to suggest solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that, so foggy and blurred is the mirror, that nothing can be seen of the ‘realities’ but the vaguest of outlines. Does the reader agree, in principle, that it is right to ‘oppose tyranny’? Regardless of the answer, the novel suggests, nothing will really change.<br>

<p>In another <a href="https://johannesburgreviewofbooks.com/2021/08/19/i-decided-to-give-up-writing-and-to-rethink-my-life-karen-jennings-chats-to-jennifer-malec-about-her-booker-prize-longlisted-novel-an-island/">interview, this one with the <em>Johannesburg Review of Books</em></a>, Jennings discusses the difficulties she faced in writing <em>An Island</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was so much that was difficult about it. Firstly, trying to write a sensitive and nuanced book about a very complex set of topics—to do it without being heavy handed or reductive. Secondly, to write a readable, compelling story in which basically nothing happens!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the first point, I found <em>An Island</em> to be too steeped in the vagaries of allegory to have anything insightful to say about either the political realities of post-colonialism, or the manner in which living in such circumstances might shape a person. And, as to the second point, I’m not convinced Jennings has succeeded there either. Paragraph-to-paragraph I enjoyed her writing well enough, but the relative slightness of the story, paired with its unrelenting cynicism, made the book feel increasingly like a chore as it progressed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the context in which I read <em>An Island</em> — as part of a Booker Prize longlist marathon — also makes for comparisons from which it does not profit. There is Anuk Arudpragasam’s <em>A Passage North</em>, which is more thoughtful and more grounded in its depiction of a country shaped by a history of conflict. And there is even a short section of Maggie Shipstead’s <em>Great Circle</em> that takes place on a secluded island, and which contains more deft character work than the entirety of Jennings’s novel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The miserable have no other medicine<br>
But only hope.</p>
<p>— <em>Measure For Measure</em>, Act III Scene i</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sunjeev Sahota is a British writer of Indian heritage, who was previously shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2015, with his second novel: <em>The Year of Runaways</em>. That novel dealt with the lives of Indian immigrant workers in England, and followed Sahota’s first novel — <em>Ours Are the Streets</em> (2011) — which told the story of a British Pakistani’s radicalisation towards a terrorist act. <em>China Room</em> continues this examination of the topics of race, and entrapment within societal structures, but Sahota’s approach here is somewhat different.</p>
<p>The basic structure of <em>China Room</em> is an interweaving of two narratives separated by ~70 years, and three familial generations. Mehar Kaur lives on a farm in 1920s India, where she has been married to one of three brothers – though she does not know which. At the close of the 20th century, her great-grandson arrives at the farm from his home in England, hoping to escape an addiction to heroin.</p>
<p>For the most part Mehar’s narrative — which is based in part upon a story from Sahota’s own family history — eschews the trappings of ‘period’ writing, and feels every bit as alive to the reader as the more modern strand. There is, however, one important exception: the centrality to the plot of something very like a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_trick">bed trick</a>’, a literary device that pre-dates the bible, whereby the plot is moved forward by improbable cases of mistaken identity during intercourse. Not only does it feel more like literary device than convincing plotting, but my primary association with it is from Shakespeare’s dark comedies: <em>Measure For Measure</em>, and <em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em>. This, unavoidably, coloured the tone of Sahota’s novel for me, such that I found myself treating it less like a piece of realism and more like a morality play. The characters are mostly well drawn, and Sahota has a talent for evoking the physical composition of scenes. At its heart though, Mehar’s narrative has an uneasy balance between its commitment to a romance plot, and the depth with which it can interrogate the complex injustices of her circumstance.</p>
<p>The other narrative suffers from a similar imbalance. The narrator’s addiction is inciting incident enough to get him to India, but I felt that the treatment of it afterwards was too cursory. Sahota’s way with detail and allusion is enough to convey some aspects of his narrator’s plight, but he’s unwilling to give over much narrative space to exploring the depths of addiction’s misery. For a writer of Sahota’s talents, this is clearly a choice about the type of novel he wants to write. I couldn’t help but feel some disappointment, however, at the focus being placed on a relatively predictable romance plot instead of something more substantive.</p>
<p>Ultimately I found <em>China Room</em> to be very readable; Sahota’s style is characterised by an easy flow, with a particular talent for enlivening scenes through the description of details such as facial expression and clothing. I found both of the narratives, separately, were enjoyable despite the reservations outlined above<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I remained less convinced, however, that the novel does much to draw out an interesting parallel between the two. There is the familial relationship, and the shared geographic location of the two plots. But, beyond that, there is only the broadest of generalities. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/25/sunjeev-sahota-china-room-interview-class-race">interview with <em>The Guardian</em></a> around the novel’s release, Sahota attempts at first to make the case for a deeper connection between the book’s two narratives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The two strands of the novel talk to each other,” he says. “There’s this mutual haunting that’s going along – the echoes and the mirrorings and the whispers across time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I found the manner in which he goes on to characterise this relationship to be telling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Both characters are seeking a kind of liberation, and they’re both suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, could be said of virtually <em>any</em> protagonist in any novel. It is the very basis of storytelling that a character wants something, and suffers in trying to obtain it. In <em>China Room</em>, the mere fact that the two characters are blood relatives did not feel like enough to establish meaningful parallels between their individual struggles.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I came away from <em>China Room</em> having enjoyed the novel, though lamenting its slightness. Of course, it would have been a very different book if the stories of four generations had been included, and it is understandably not the novel that Sahota has set out to write. Nevertheless, choices such as the inclusion of the nascent Indian revolutionary movement as a plot element in Mehar’s story, left me wanting to know more of what happened to the family between the times of the two included narratives. I couldn’t escape the feeling that a vital part of the wider story had been elided, and that each half of the novel as it stands suffers from the absence. This, in turn, contributed to an overall sense that Sahota had elected to include <em>parts</em> of two narratives, as opposed to a satisfyingly deep exploration of either one. <em>China Room</em> could very well be the opening volume in a captivating family saga; I would return to its settings and characters, and to Sahota’s sure-handed depiction of them, with pleasure. As it stands however, I found <em>China Room</em> enjoyable, but somewhat wanting for depth.</p>

<p>Without having planned it this way, I seem to have begun reading the 2021 Booker Prize longlist by alternating philosophical novels with those more story-centric. <em>A Town Called Solace</em> falls firmly into the latter category, and as such I’m going to make an effort to leave story specifics to the end of these notes, so as not to spoil things for interested future readers.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the great strengths of <em>A Town Called Solace</em> is the interplay between its three narrators. The manner in which Mary Lawson portions out plot beats to the reader is well judged. Often one character’s narrative will tease a further revelation to which another of the narrator’s holds the missing piece. Even if the narrators themselves aren’t able to put all of the puzzle together, the reader feels increasingly rewarded by the plot’s breadcrumb trail. I enjoyed the interplay between the three narrators’ blind spots, and how it placed the reader at the centre of a Venn diagram: the only one who got to see a full picture. Occasionally Lawson cannot help but use this device with good-natured cruelty, closing Chapter 7 with a dramatic event, and immediately switching (in Chapter 8) to the vantage point of the one character who isn’t involved. This, however, only served to keep me turning pages, and I found it to be an excellent method of constructing a thriller.</p>
<p>Alas, technique — and Lawson’s perfectly serviceable, unexceptional writing style — didn’t prove to be enough to sustain the novel for me. Having completed it, my overall impression was that the author was more interested in place than plot. Her love for the particular region of Canada in which the novel is set, is evident even before she opens the ‘Acknowledgements’ section thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The town of Solace exists only in my imagination, but the setting is very real: the vast and beautiful area of lakes and rocks and forests known as the Canadian Shield, in Northern Ontario. Locating the story there was an act of self-indulgence on my part; it is the landscape I think of when I think of home, and writing about it allows me to revisit it in my mind. (p289)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a shame then, that Lawson doesn’t do enough to make the reader fall in love with her setting or her characters. When I think of Fannie Flagg’s southern US, or the Maine of many Stephen King novels, I have a far more vivid mental picture of the locales, and a better sense for the texture of the culture: the way the language is spoken, customs, and mannerisms. Those authors are both excellent at conjuring personality (of both persons and places) from detail, in a way that Lawson has not mastered. Even the narrators, with whom we necessarily spend the most time, remain less than fully realised up to the close of the novel.</p>
<p>Before writing in more specific detail about the plot, I’ll close the non-spoiler portion of these notes by saying that <em>A Town Called Solace</em> is the weakest of the four longlisted novels I’ve read thus far. It’s certainly not unenjoyable, but I came away feeling as though it had not fulfilled the potential of its setup, instead settling for sentimentality.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>OK, if you’re still reading this I’m going to assume you’ve either read the novel yourself or have no intention of doing so. If the former, I wonder whether you share my frustration with its denouement. Perhaps it is my failing as a reader, but to my mind a novel that sets as its inciting incident the disappearance of a young girl, should have in store some revelation about that mystery. In <em>A Town Called Solace</em>, Rose’s disappearance is treated as central to the plot, until it’s resolved in a cursory couple of paragraphs and thereafter has no bearing on the rest of the novel. I found this case of Chekhov’s missing girl to be deeply unsatisfying in a story sense. I had anticipated that upon Rose’s return she would provide a key missing piece to the mechanics of the plot, but instead it turns out that the author has merely kept her off the page as a way to animate strains of the narrative involving Clara and Liam. Rose, introduced as strong and wilful (at least through her sister’s eyes), is given no agency or voice, and the details of what happened to her are treated as entirely unimportant once her return has provided some form of resolution for Clara.</p>
<p>Similarly, I did not like the manner in which Liam’s story closes. It is possible, in showing his (and Jo’s) vacillations, that Lawson is attempting to construct a version of the running-to-the-airport scene that might end a romantic comedy. However, it’s a ‘romance’ introduced so late in the novel that there is no possible way a reader can feel any investment in it. Lawson lays out Jo’s backstory (including a needlessly cruel relationship history) in a short paragraph less than 20 pages before the close of the novel, as though just then realising that the character remains little more than a sketch. Likewise the third act arrival, and swift departure, of Fiona felt like a hollow attempt at showing the emotional progress Liam had made during his time in the wholesome, healing environs of Solace.</p>
<p>That Lawson chooses to end the novel with the first meeting between Liam and Moses (the cat with whom he has been sharing a house for months, but has never seen), speaks directly to the book’s sentimentality. I’m certainly not averse to that tone in principle, but in order for it to work the reader must feel invested in the world of the novel: its setting, and most importantly its characters. I didn’t feel as though <em>A Town Called Solace</em> did nearly enough to make that possible. What’s more, given how little it makes of the mystery at its centre, the book has little else to fall back on.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of the joys of choosing to read the entirety of the 2021 Booker Prize longlist, is being able to start novels knowing very little about them. I began Anuk Arudpragasam’s <em>A Passage North</em> without so much as having read the back cover, and I was delighted to find a novel full of heart and human feeling, unafraid to address the largest of topics with an assured, light touch.</p>
<p>I was most impressed by the structure of Arudpragasam’s novel, which has at its centre a relatively simple narrative: someone associated with the protagonist’s family dies, and he travels to attend their funeral. From here, however, the author uses the spine of the story to make a series of discursive forays into larger questions in Krishan’s life, and on his mind. The manner in which the text moves smoothly into and out of these extended meditations is handled with the utmost care. The reader finds themselves caught up in Krishan’s thoughts on a particular poem, or his hopes and fears surrounding his relationship with a partner, and is then returned to the slow-moving flow of the main narrative with something more about Krishan’s character having been illuminated. These discursions — which hold a prominence in the text above that of the contemporary action, such that in truth they are the substance of the novel — are sometimes intensely personal, and sometimes more widely scoped. As such, it will help the reader to have at least a broad understanding of the contours of the Sri Lankan civil war, but tellingly the more universally accessible themes are the more specific, interpersonal ones. I found particularly affecting the saga, relayed early in the novel, of Krishan’s grandmother’s declining health, and thus declining independence. Arudpragasam makes of it a delicate, compassionate examination of pride and human frailty.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the majority of the text, an overall arc to the novel remained hidden to me. However, towards the book’s conclusion I found Arudpragasam introducing a suggestion of personal growth for Krishan. In earlier periods described in the text he sometimes exhibits a tendency to conceive of his own experience as being, in some respects, qualitatively different to those of other people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as though for most of his life he’d been driven by a longing that was somehow stronger or more insistent than that of most people he knew, by a desire that had to meet more resistance than average before it could be vanquished</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the culmination of the narrative, however, his experiences at Rani’s funeral seem to have widened and softened Krishan’s thinking. He begins to comprehend something of the universality of the human experience, not just <em>intellectually</em> but on a deeper, more personal level. Arudpragasam has carefully introduced these ideas throughout the novel — as part, for example, of Krishan’s retelling of the story of the Buddha — but only towards the text’s conclusion does his protagonist begin to exhibit a deeper-seated, personal understanding of them.</p>
<p>This nascent insight, of course, cannot extinguish the baseline suffering of the human condition — what, in Tamil, would be called துக்கம் (<em>thukkam</em>), and which western Buddhists are more likely to know by its Pali name: <em>dukkha</em>. Towards the very end of the text we find Krishan attempting to establish for himself a frame for this dilemma that places ‘desire’ in contrast to ‘yearning’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To desire, in a sense, was to know or think one knew what one wanted, to know or think one knew the paths by which it might be reached, even if those paths turned out to be too difficult to follow, even if the things they led to, the things one desired, turned out not to provide the liberation one thought. To yearn on the other hand was to be lost, to lack bearings in the world because one did not know what one was seeking or where it could be found, so that unable to distract oneself, by frenetic activity or single-minded pursuit, from the painful sense of lack, one’s only consolation was to look out across vast distances, as if surely somewhere in the expansiveness of the horizon, across space and sea and sky, some possibility was contained that could make life self-sufficient and devoid of need, some possibility that could bring an end to time. That such a possibility didn’t exist he was now old enough to know…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useful in so far as it helps him toward an understanding of both the uniqueness and the <em>universality</em> of human suffering. It does not, however, offer him any reprieve. We do not witness Krishan return at this point to the tension between attachment and detachment that Arudpragasam has introduced elsewhere in the novel. Regardless, we feel that he has begun to develop a greater sense of compassion, and that in itself is a profound step.</p>
<p>Within a story rooted in the wider Tamil struggle against persecution, Arudpragasam offers the reader a picture of several lives burdened with unique struggles. By expertly revealing the universality of suffering within the human experience, he is able to offer a different vantage point from which to view struggle at any scale. That he is able to do all of this within the form of an immensely readable, warm, and very human novel, is a testament to his great talent as a novelist.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>During the week I played through <em>Twelve Minutes</em>, a video game from Luís António &amp; Annapurna Interactive, and I need to vent a little! I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this title for a while, a) because I like games that centre story; b) because I take Annapurna&rsquo;s imprimatur as indicative of a level of quality; and c) because its time-loop mechanic sounded unique.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more or less <em>fighting</em> the urge to write something longer here, because generally I don&rsquo;t like to write negative pieces – if I don&rsquo;t enjoy something I tend to just not write about it, and move on. <em>Twelve Minutes</em>, however, proved to be <em>such</em> a disappointment on several different levels that I have to at least say something brief.</p>
<p>In short, this is a game with six single-screen environments<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, approximately two-dozen objects with which one can interact<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and four characters, only two of whom are anything more than a plot device.</p>
<p>The headline actors are wasted on a script that is cumbersome and poorly thought out. The storytelling, which requires a certain density because it needs to develop in twelve minute increments, is doled out in a heavy-handed manner that elicited from me an eye-roll or groan with most of its beats. The less said about the final twist, upon which the entire thing depends, the better. Suffice to say that it makes so little sense as to undermine any affection for the characters that the player may have developed despite the rest of the game&rsquo;s glaring flaws. I found myself, hours after finishing the game, shaking my head at how poorly conceived the whole thing is, and how badly it&rsquo;s executed.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the act of playing <em>Twelve Minutes</em> quickly becomes repetitive and unenjoyable. Even if the player is able to parse the game&rsquo;s often non-sensical logic so as to understand what they need to do next, they are required to play out the rote preceding steps for a sixth time to reach an inflection point. This includes the game compelling the player to repeatedly drug their pregnant wife into a state of unconsciousness – just one of several instances of abhorrent violence upon a pregnant woman, about which the game does nothing to warn the player.</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to stop myself there. <em>Twelve Minutes</em> was first previewed in 2015, and I found it difficult to believe that the finished product some six years later was so slight, and so thoroughly disappointing in terms of both storytelling and game mechanics. At the time of writing, the game is available on Game Pass<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; however, even if you&rsquo;re a subscriber to that service, I can only recommend that you play it if you wish to be perplexed, disappointed, and then infuriated.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<p>And, if we&rsquo;re being honest, it&rsquo;s really just three small rooms and a cupboard.  &#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In some ways the second book in my marathon read of the 2021 Booker Prize could not be more different from the first. Whereas Rachel Cusk’s <a href="/secondplace"><em>Second Place</em></a> is a slim, dense novel of ideas, which confines its action to a single spread of marshland, Maggie Shipstead’s <em>Great Circle</em> is an epic in multiple senses of that word. Its story is rich, and is peopled with a diverse cast of characters, whose lives Shipstead weaves together into an expansive tapestry, spread over decades and continents.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I feel as though my notes here should be presented in two sections: this first, which need only be short, is directed at anyone who’s wondering whether they should read this novel. I can only say that I found <em>Great Circle</em> to be an unalloyed pleasure. The experience of reading it was reminiscent of first encounters with similarly ambitious novels, such as Michael Chabon’s <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</em> (2000), and Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> (2013). Having deliberately begun the novel with no prior knowledge, I was at first surprised and delighted, and then found myself walking the emotional tightrope of being so impressed and swept along by a novel that I was desperate for it to not falter! And it does not; having spent the best part of the last two days reading <em>Great Circle</em> I can honestly say I’m already looking forward to revisiting it in years to come.</p>
<p>This is a book that is unrelentingly generous in its gifts, offering the reader countless brilliantly-orchestrated set pieces and unforgettable moments in its characters’ lives. It’s as though, having begun the novel with a sinking ocean liner, then moving to mountaintop horse-riding, and biplane flying barnstormers, Shipstead thinks <em>why not</em>, and proceeds to include Prohibition era gangsters, bordellos, assassination, wartime romance, and finally – of course – a flight around the world. At each turn I found myself marvelling at both the novel’s scope and its ambition. In lesser hands it is a recipe for either a jumbled mess or at best some camp, pulpy fun. Shipstead, however, reaches for far more, and has the talent necessary to attain it.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As an interval, here’s a small bonus since the novel inspired me to fire up <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>. They didn’t have a Steerman in the game, but this is a shot of a biplane I took out over Missoula, MT just to get a better sense of what that experience might look like.</p>

<p>OK, if you’re still reading, be warned that the following gives <em>some</em> specifics for this wonderful novel that you should absolutely read.</p>
<p>To my mind, one of the book’s great successes is the extent to which it manages to remain interested simultaneously in both the macro and micro: the grand sweep of the narrative — encompassing several generations of multiple families — is bejewelled with many moments of crystalline beauty. Shipstead unfailingly knows when best to pause the story’s self-perpetuated momentum, and indulge in the scenes that she has brought about. Take, as just one example, this passage from the beginning of the novel that feels as though the author is pulling the camera out, better to frame the action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below [the ship’s] lights and honeycombed cabins, below the men toiling in red heat and black dust, below her barnacled keel, a school of cod passed, a dense pack of flexing bodies in the darkness, eyes bulging wide though there was nothing to see. Below the fish: cold and pressure, empty black miles, a few strange, luminescent creatures drifting after flecks of food. Then the sandy bottom, blank except for faint trails left by hardy shrimp, blind worms, creatures who would never know such a thing as light existed. (p20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On countless occasions, Shipstead proves herself to be enormously skilled at conjuring striking images that leaps off the page for the reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a riderless horse had run into the hangar at their aerodrome from God knows where, dreadfully burned, perhaps mistaking the structure for a barn. They’d shot the poor thing to put it out of its misery. “One time,” Felix said, “I was shooting at a German and his engine caught fire, so he climbed out onto the wing and jumped. He was wearing a huge brown fur coat and looked like a bear falling through the sky. (p89)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, whilst I frequently found myself re-reading such moments to enjoy the frame that Shipstead had frozen, the true pleasure of the novel comes from immersing oneself in the grand, romantic architecture of its narrative. <em>Great Circle</em> has at its core some big questions: such as that of the individual’s power to pursue their ambitions, and the extent to which ambition itself is a dangerous compass by which to navigate. I found these threads intertwined with the similarly large and thorny question of destiny in the novel, in a manner that grew pleasantly more nuanced and complicated throughout.</p>
<p>Early in the book allusions are made suggesting a natural order by which things progress: Marian’s uncle Wallace explaining to her that ‘Water was always on its way somewhere bigger’ (p45). And, indeed, it feels like love-at-first-sight to Marian when she initially encounters flight first hand. But, as the novel progresses, there is a more troubling instance of love-at-first-sight figured in Barclay’s controlling obsession with Marian.</p>
<p>These loves each prove to be fraught in different ways. As Barclay comes to find that ‘what he wants is not actually in her but beyond her’ (p204), so Marian ‘longs to fly on even though the horizon will only ever recede’ (p195). The central tenet of their relationship proves to be that Marian often gets what she wants, but wonders constantly at the price; she ‘senses she is inside a trap, the dimensions and mechanism of which remain concealed’ (p187).</p>
<p>The relationship remains compelling precisely because Shipstead resists the temptation to make Barclay out as a cartoon villain, and is content to complicate the dynamics, and leave the complications unresolved. When the trade of sex in return for flying ‘over the line’ happens, it is not clear to the reader whose idea it ultimately is, Marian’s or Barclay’s.</p>
<p>When, later in the text, Hadley critiques Carol Redwood’s book for trying to make Marian into too much of a romantic character, it helped emphasise for me the extent to which, throughout <em>Great Circle</em>, Shipstead walks this line assuredly. She is always more interested in making Marian a fuller, more nuanced presence no matter how grand and romantic the arc of her life might appear from the macro perspective.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If I had one quibble with the novel, it is that as the narratives progresses it develops a slight problem with stakes. Switching between Marian’s life-and-death exploits during the Second World War, to Hadley’s love triangle, sometimes made the latter seem ridiculous. I found myself increasingly frustrated with Hadley’s sometimes myopic narration in these passages, precisely because her problems were comparatively slight.</p>
<p>There is every chance, however, that this has something to do with me as a reader. There is one stretch, about two thirds of the way through the novel, where multiple chapters in a row deal first with Hadley’s complicated relationship with Alexei, then Marian’s complicated relationship with Caleb, and then Jamie’s complicated relationship with Sarah. Shipstead may have constructed things this way so as to invite the reader to draw comparisons, but the beats of these relationships were never as interesting to me as the larger themes of the novel. As such, the portions of the book that centred relationship intrigue for extended periods felt to me like distractions from the real narrative, to which I longed to return.</p>
<p>It was around this same point in the novel that I began to hope that there would prove to be more to Hadley’s story than simply a clever device, teasing the reader as to what happened to Marian. Ultimately I was pleased that Shipstead refrained from making explicit comparisons between the two women. She simply provides the raw material, and allows the reader to draw from it what they wish. I, for example, enjoyed the parallel between Marian’s experience in the endless white  of the Antarctic, and Hadley’s in the darkness of the glow worm cave: both women unsure whether they are still alive, or if they’ve unknowingly passed through the veil into death. In the final analysis Hadley’s story proves to be far more than a mere plot device, but the novel is very much Marian’s. I can imagine that knowing this, and thus being free from second-guessing the author’s intentions as to structure, will only strengthen this already extraordinary book for me on a second reading.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="/booker21">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
NB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The first stop on my 2021 Booker Prize longlist odyssey is the latest novel from an author with whom I’m already familiar. <em>Second Place</em> is the first work of fiction Rachel Cusk has published since the completion of her <em>Outline</em> trilogy three years ago<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; I read those three books — <em>Outline</em> (2014); <em>Transit</em> (2017); &amp; <em>Kudos</em> (2018) — earlier this year, and the experience left me eager to explore more of her work. It’s fortunate for me then, that <em>Second Place</em> has garnered Cusk her second Booker nomination.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Much has been made of the statement in the ‘Acknowledgements’ section of <em>Second Place</em>, that the novel ‘owes a debt to <em>Lorenzo in Taos</em>, Mabel Dodge Luhan’s 1932 memoir of the time D. H. Lawrence came to stay with her in Taos’. Doubtless, this touchstone offers one lens through which we can view Cusk’s novel, but it is perhaps most instructive merely in terms of the book’s form. <em>Second Place</em> (similar to Dodge Luhan’s memoir) is a kind of epistolary work, presented as an extended outpouring by the narrator (M) to one Jeffers, about whom we learn little. In truth, however, I read <em>Second Place</em> as following not in Dodge Luhan’s footsteps, but more closely in those of DH Lawrence.</p>
<p>In her introduction to the 2011 Vintage edition of Lawrence’s <em>The Rainbow</em>, Cusk quotes from a letter Lawrence wrote in 1913, in which he argues that the most vital pursuit of his age should be ‘the establishment of a new relation, or the re-adjustment of the old one, between men and women’. This, Cusk argues, is precisely the project in which Lawrence is engaged across both <em>The Rainbow</em> (1915) and its sequel, <em>Women in Love</em> (1920). As she phrases the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without the context of hearth and home, childbearing, male protection inextricable from female servitude, what will love between a man and woman be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A century later, the same question is at the centre of Cusk’s novel. Throughout the book we witness M struggle with understanding, or re-conceiving, her place in the world: what is her proper relationship to the people and structures in it, and to what extent are those relationships open to self-determination or imposed by external forces? As Cusk phrased it in a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/eagr-p52-H4">interview with Politics &amp; Prose</a>, M is troubled by the question of ‘not being sure whether the whole of femininity was a trick that you fell for’. Thus, the reader is presented with a tapestry of M’s thoughts and feelings on subjects such as the evolution of her relationship with her daughter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True love is the product of freedom, and I’m not sure a parent and child can ever have that kind of love, unless they decide to start over again as adults. (p75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the promise and limitations of the creative act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because this is partly a story of will, and of the consequences of exerting it, you will notice, Jeffers, that everything I determined to happen happened, but not as I wanted it! This is the difference, I suppose, between an artist and an ordinary person: the artist can create outside himself the perfect replica of his own intentions. The rest of us just create a mess, or something hopelessly wooden, no matter how brilliantly we imagined it. (p22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a hallmark of Cusk’s narrators that they are at once highly perceptive (of both the world around them, and of their own interior worlds), and also have a mysterious access to the interior worlds of others. A different novelist may choose to reveal elements of characters’ histories, personalities, thoughts and feelings, if not by employing omniscient third-person narration then through extended sections of dialogue. Cusk largely elides these conversations, and often allows her first-person narrators an almost mystical-seeming access to the inner lives of others. This, coupled with the manner in which Cusk constructs her narratives to shift easily and seamlessly between times, places, and topics, gives her novels a dreamlike quality. The reader commonly finds themselves transported, in the space of a few pages, between several periods, places, topics, and states of mind – the shifts effected frictionlessly and rendered in exquisite, flowing paragraphs.</p>
<p>It felt to me as though Cusk provides a greater sense of evolution in <em>Second Place</em> than was the case in the <em>Outline</em> trilogy. Towards the novel’s culmination there are indications that M has made progress towards, if not resolution, at least finding a greater sense of peace in the search. <em>Second Place</em> is a book to which I’m likely to return; the density of its ideas and unanswered questions can sometimes feel overwhelming, but it rewards the reader’s willingness to be open to them.</p>

			 <p>Baseball is ridiculous. Sport, actually, when you think about it: ridiculous. Aren&rsquo;t there better things all these super-fit men and women could be doing with their time and their gifted mastery of their own bodies? Surely. But the beautiful things human beings create are rarely useful, they are made for different reasons.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people on the internet this morning expressing their frustration at the Chicago Cubs' recent performance. I get it: the team has lost five straight games and hasn&rsquo;t scored a single run in the last 20 innings of play; 24 games into the season they&rsquo;re last in their division, and only two teams in the majors have a worse record.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a lot of beauty in this game. Take for example the storyline that has been playing out between Cubs' first baseman, Anthony Rizzo, and his Atlanta Braves counterpart, Freddie Freeman. Drafted one year apart, both Golden Glove winners and multiple-time All Stars, their respective performances on the field have been <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/54824/whos-better-freeman-versus-rizzo">inspiring comparison</a> for years. What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;re both eminently likeable people who happen to be friends. So, when the former caught the latter in a rundown during a game last week, it was our good fortune that he was wearing a microphone:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Final: Braves 13, Cubs 4. <a href="https://t.co/wh8N3DfSbb">pic.twitter.com/wh8N3DfSbb</a></p>&mdash; Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cubs/status/1383972436098441224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>That moment inspired a t-shirt, which Freeman naturally <a href="https://twitter.com/obvious_shirts/status/1387210265314398208?s=20">ended up wearing</a>. And then, last night, when another game was beyond the reach of the Cubs' silent offence, manager David Ross gave his first baseman a chance to pitch to his friend. Freeman had hits in each of his four prior plate appearances in the game, including a home run in the previous inning. But his red hot bat was no match for Rizzo&rsquo;s… <em>checks notes</em>… 74mph fastball. It&rsquo;s worth watching <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/anthony-rizzo-strikes-out-freddie-freeman">the battle in full</a>, but the joy of the moment is hard to miss.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Take a seat, FREDERICK.<a href="https://twitter.com/ARizzo44?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ARizzo44</a> <a href="https://t.co/ArqdIRVuM3">pic.twitter.com/ArqdIRVuM3</a></p>&mdash; Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cubs/status/1387585742445105162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And yet many people seem to miss it. [<a href="https://twitter.com/Hawkihayes/status/1387591271124983810?s=20">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gremlin23/status/1387591215634321415?s=20">2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cubschiefsfan10/status/1387600381010644993?s=20">3</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MuhdiMajde/status/1387593449478709251?s=20">4</a>]</p>
<p>For those to whom the final score is everything, it seems as though reading the box score would be as good as watching the game. If you can&rsquo;t take joy from moments like these the whole enterprise of sport is completely lost on you. Despite his embarrassment at the plate, Freddie Freeman gets it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s one strikeout I’m okay with. That’s what baseball is; that’s what sports is: it’s to put smiles on people’s faces. I was on the wrong side of it tonight, but I’m okay with it. I’m sure a lot of people got some good smiles and laughs, ‘cause that’s what sports is about.</p>

			 <p>Recently, apropos of nothing in particular, I did some thinking about how and why I got started blogging. That led to a mild shock of realisation that it had been two decades since I first created a Blogger account. In turn, that seemed like reason enough for a little reflection.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-started">How It Started</h3>
<p>Along one of the shorter sides of the University of Reading&rsquo;s main campus green space sits a building constructed mostly from dark brown brick, with a white entrance façade. This weirdly angular structure is the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vJhbmebJTtfWgDEn8">Palmer Building</a>, and it was home to a couple of milestone moments for me during my time at the University. It was in the 400 seat Palmer Lecture Theatre that I sat watching a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236216/">documentary about the Sex Pistols</a>, whilst the rest of my Law school cohort attended a gala function. It was in the same lecture hall that I saw my first iPod in the wild, looking eagerly (perhaps even a little creepily) over another student&rsquo;s shoulder as he scrolled and scrolled that mechanical wheel, changing selections on the monochrome screen. I myself, at the time, was notoriously never more than arm&rsquo;s reach from my CD Walkman – one professor started calling me &lsquo;wired for sound&rsquo; for my habit of wearing headphones around my neck during her seminars.</p>
<p>However, it isn&rsquo;t the lecture theatre of the Palmer Building that I remember most clearly, but the room directly beneath it. On a couple of rows of tables were set out a dozen or so chunky Pentium II PCs: dull metal towers the size of a (large) briefcase, and CRT monitors as deep as they were wide. At a time when only <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/275999/household-internet-penetration-in-great-britain/">13% of UK homes</a> were connected to the internet, there was something magical to me about a roomful of machines wired up to the web. And the real joy of that room was that, unlike the rest of the building, it could be accessed 24 hours a day. I was already enamoured of the internet by the time I reached University in 1999, but that was where the relationship really developed. With a magnetic keycard and an entry code I could access the web any time I wanted. And so I did. Foregoing study, socialising, and sleep, I frequently left my room in Wells Hall in the late evening and — with <em>Neon Ballroom</em> or <em>Hybrid Theory</em> on my headphones — made the 10 minute walk to the Palmer Building Computer Room. Often the number pad on which you were expected to enter an access code refused to cooperate, and you had to rely on there being someone else inside who had also chosen to spend their night with the internet, and who would answer your pleading knock.</p>
<p>It was in that room that I asked and was asked for my &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a/s/l">a/s/l</a>&rsquo; on the brand new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger">MSN Messenger</a>. It was there that I ignored all dictums against installing software, and instead lobbied my fellow late night denizens to join me in multiplayer LAN sessions of <em>Doom II</em>. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups">Yahoo! Groups</a> launched during my second year, I spent uncountable late night hours in that room arguing the merits of various punk bands with Americans in the middle of their days, and Europeans even deeper into their nights.</p>
<p>It was to that room that I went on September 11th 2001, having received an SMS on my Nokia 3210 from an ex-girlfriend telling me to turn on the TV. My TV wasn&rsquo;t hooked up, but I knew a place I could get all the information I needed, and where I&rsquo;d be able to join countless other people asking one another just what the heck was going on.</p>
<p>And it was also in that room that I began writing my first blog. Hosted  on Pyra Labs' Blogger (pre Google acquisition), mine was the simplest stream of posts on the music I was listening to, films I was watching, books I was reading, and games I was playing.</p>
<p>If you wanted to hear why Deftones' <em>White Pony</em> was an instant classic; observe in real-time as <em>Mulholland Drive</em> melted my mind; read an argument about what made <em>Invisible Monsters</em> a worthy follow-up to <em>Fight Club</em>; or lament the premature death of the Dreamcast, I had you covered. In the years since, I&rsquo;ve had blogs and personal sites hosted on various platforms (Wordpress, Squarespace, Svbtle), and in truth the subject matter has remained largely unchanged! Occasionally I&rsquo;ve run social accounts alongside these sites, but the blog was always there as a home for my <del>more considered</del> lengthier thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="how-its-going">How It&rsquo;s Going</h3>
<p>In the year 2021 I find myself several years deep into a state of confusion about what the social web has become. As the internet has grown increasingly omnipresent and ubiquitous, the amount of content generated has grown exponentially, but — at least in the most heavily trafficked spaces — the forms of expression have become homogenised. The vast majority of published material is made to fit into one of a vanishingly small number of moulds. Likewise, platform ubiquity has led to a weird blurring of previously guarded lines: social / professional; public / private etc. The nature(s) of connections between people, groups, corporations, and institutions has undergone a series of seismic shifts facilitated by these technologies.</p>
<p>Nine years ago I published a post titled &lsquo;<a href="/socialweird">The Social Web Got Weird</a>'<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Re-reading it now it&rsquo;s fascinating how things have further developed; not as I had expected, or predicted, that&rsquo;s for sure. About three years ago I published a <a href="/ontwitter">somewhat torturous post</a> seeking to explain the idiosyncrasies of how I used Twitter. The short version is that I had found it necessary to contort myself into all manner of untenable postures just to feel OK about using the social web. That&rsquo;s not a hole I&rsquo;ve managed to entirely dig my way out of, but my thinking continues to evolve.</p>
<p>At present I have accounts all over the place… but none of them are active. Or, I guess it might be more accurate to say that they are largely &lsquo;read-only&rsquo;. Some of these tools have more than proven their utility; for example, the experience of following a baseball season without Twitter would now feel much diminished. In many other cases I feel drawn to at least be notionally present simply because of how interested I am in the internet as a phenomenon. The web is still capable of making me feel thrilled and captivated and engaged. For me, the internet&rsquo;s staggering power and potential remain undimmed since those days (and nights) in the Palmer Building Computer Room. The bottom line is that the web is still a place I want to be, and I have an inkling that the blog format still holds promise for me ~20 years after I first created one.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-joywave--possession">20. Joywave — <em>Possession</em></h3>
<p>Three years ago Joywave announced themselves to me, and took second place on my 2017 list, with their sophomore album <em>Content</em>. At the time I said that I found the band ‘very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent’ and guess what? <em>Possession</em> is another assured, multi-faceted set of a dozen uncategorisable bops. Of the previous record I listed the genres touched upon as ‘including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…’ and that’s still all in the mix here though, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on the new album feels slightly more humane and less coldly electronic than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Like a Kennedy’ is, for me, one of the defining songs of the Trump / Brexit era: a vulnerable, exhausted lament that asks only for the simplest things amidst incomprehensible turmoil. ‘F.E.A.R.’ twists ‘Monster Mash’ DNA into a campy downbeat stomp, whereas ‘Funny Thing About Opinions’ is an upbeat treatise on the state of internet dialogue.</p>
<p>This is another record of surprising, inventive dance-pop-rock cuts that was everything I wanted from more Joywave. I would love to see these guys live when that’s possible once more, though—with the same sense of humour apparent in their music—the band’s faux-Fox News website informs me that their touring has been postponed ‘due to pressure from health experts and communists’.</p>
<h3 id="19-oliver-coates--skins-n-slime">19. Oliver Coates — <em>skins n slime</em></h3>
<p>On my spider-diagram of musical influences there would be a large number of lines spreading outwards from Radiohead, and Oliver Coates is the newest addition. It seems like a fitting way to encounter a classically trained cellist making something he’s called (probably with tongue firmly in cheek) ‘pastoral metal’.</p>
<p>It’s a tough task to affix meaningful labels to what Coates is doing on <em>skins n slime</em>, and that’s not a bad thing. Sure, I take his allusion to metal, but there’s also drone influences à la Roly Porter, and minimalist composition à la William Basinski &amp; Steve Reich (with whom Coates has previously collaborated). The result is a singular mélange of a headphone record that I found mesmerising.</p>
<h3 id="18-empress-of--im-your-empress-of">18. Empress Of — <em>I’m Your Empress Of</em></h3>
<p>Despite this being her third record, Lorely Rodriguez—as Empress Of—is a new artist to me this year. She also, drum roll, made my favourite track of the year in the form of peerless, euphoric dance banger ‘Love is a Drug’. But that’s just one of the jewels on offer here. The album’s true opener (though it follows a sweet intro) ‘Bit of Rain’ is a house-infused treat, whereas ‘Shold’ve’ is a more complex, layered affair.</p>
<p>Only three tracks break the three-minute barrier, and the album as a whole is only a little over a half hour, content to show up, put a smile on your face, and dip out leaving you wanting more. This was a trip I took dozens of times since the record’s release back in spring, and I’ll be playing it for a while yet. I’ll also be looking out both for remixes of what’s here, and for what Rodriguez does next.</p>
<h3 id="17-phoebe-bridgers--punisher">17. Phoebe Bridgers — <em>Punisher</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Someday, I&rsquo;m gonna live<br>
In your house up on the hill<br>
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing<br>
I&rsquo;ll plant a garden in the yard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are the first lines delivered on <em>Punisher</em>, and a fitting testament to the fact that no one told more compelling stories on record this year than Phoebe Bridgers. A stellar lyricist, she paints a series of vivid pictures for the listener, then uses them as the setting for raw emotional openness. It’s the same formula used by her partner in Better Oblivion Community Center: one Conor Oberst. But Bridgers is painting with softer brushes and – for the most part – a darker palette.</p>
<p>The title track is a heart-rending ballad of loneliness, ‘Kyoto’ is a more up-beat invitation to sing along (if you can match Bridgers’ range), and album highlight ‘Savior Complex’ is a brilliantly judged balancing act that manages to be both delicate and devastating.</p>
<p>For whatever reason Better Oblivion Community Center didn’t really work for me last year, but <em>Punisher</em> is persuasive proof that I need to go back to Bridgers’ solo debut (<em>Stranger in the Alps</em> (2017)), and also her work with Lucy Dacus in boygenius.</p>
<p>Side note: Bridgers’ non-album <a href="https://youtu.be/JKPaA3p3bJU">cover of Radiohead’s ‘Fake Plastic Trees’</a> (with Arlo Parks) is outstanding.</p>
<p>Second side note: despite its June release I was late in coming to this album for whatever reason, and I get the distinct feeling it’s not done growing on me. Ask me in 6-12 months and this may well have climbed up a fair few places.</p>
<h3 id="16-holy-fuck--deleter">16. Holy Fuck — <em>Deleter</em></h3>
<p>HF took 7th place on this list in 2016 with their previous album: <em>Congrats</em>. I never did do the work of going back and exploring their catalogue — which is something I still <em>should</em> do — but when I saw a new LP drop at the beginning of 2020 I jumped on it. This is a record that has stuck around for me all year, and which doesn’t sound like anything else on this list.</p>
<p>HF are a band doing their own thing in their own way: bending all manner of instruments to make a supreme electronic racket with a pulse. However, the guests on <em>Deleter</em>’s opening couple of tracks make for an interesting way of triangulating the band’s place on the musical map. The understated build and break of ‘Luxe’ features Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and the more forthright follow-up of a title track includes Angus Andrew of Liars. (I made an additional comparison to Battles last time, and that still stands.)</p>
<p>My favourite track on an inventive, restless record is ‘Moment’, with its build-and-build again dynamic and krautrock hard edge.</p>
<h3 id="15-surfer-blood--carefree-theatre">15. Surfer Blood — <em>Carefree Theatre</em></h3>
<p>The last two Surfer Blood records (<em>1000 Palms</em> (2015) &amp; <em>Snowdonia</em> (2017)) haven’t found a spot in my top 20, though I remember enjoying both of them. Happily, <em>Carefree Theatre</em> is very much a return to the heights of <em>Pythons</em> (18th in 2013), if not quite <em>Astro Coast</em> (6th in 2010).</p>
<p>The sunny Florida quartet still have a way with a simple melody, decorated with pretty harmonics, and a knack for undercutting it all with a weirdly twisted lyric or unexpected shift in the tune (eg. the way the guitar line finds an unexpected low note on ‘Parkland (Into Silence)’). I’m aware that I may be being influenced by the fact they have a song referencing the director, but there’s a Lynchian twist at play here: a dive from the white picket vista to the squirming bugs in the soil. It’s the gambit Pixies perfected several decades ago, but it’s nice to hear a different take on it.</p>
<p>I haven’t done the work of going back to the third and fourth records, but I expect I would find that they were weakened relatively by virtue of Surfer Blood stretching to expand their sound. Simplicity is this band’s friend, and seems key to the bright three-minute pieces they’re capable of crafting. On this record they’re embracing it with great results, even if album closer ‘Rose Bowl’ makes for disconcerting listening at the end of 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the first day of the New Year<br>
Morning, January first<br>
This past year wasn’t great<br>
And I think it’s getting worse</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="14-biffy-clyro--a-celebration-of-endings">14. Biffy Clyro — <em>A Celebration of Endings</em></h3>
<p>Previously on this list: 9th in 2007 with <em>Puzzle</em>; 3rd in 2013 with <em>Opposites</em> and, of course, 1st in 2009 with <em>Only Revolutions</em>. Notable for its absence in that list is 2016’s <em>Ellipsis</em>, which I found to be uneven at best and did not get played much after the first couple of listens. For that reason I approached <em>A Celebration of Endings</em> with both hope and caution. I was very pleased to find that it was the former that was warranted.</p>
<p>‘North is No South’ is a statement of intent, and then it gives way to a run of four tracks (‘The Champ’ – ‘Worst Type of Best Possible’) as strong as anything the Scots have ever committed to tape. ‘Space’ is the kind of ballad that probably has Matt Cardle dreaming of another Christmas number 1, and then ‘End Of’ hits you over the head with a blackjack. As was the case with the previous three Biffy albums to make this list there’s not a bad track here. There are weaker moments (‘The Pink Limit’ doesn’t totally work for me), but they’re hugely outnumbered by consistently arresting songwriting and the band’s knack for finding strange new ways to twist a riff or subvert a time signature.</p>
<p>That’s true from the the bruiser of an opening track, right until ‘Cop Syrup’ plays the record out like a weird update of Nirvana’s ‘Beeswax’ (1992).</p>
<h3 id="13-the-beths--jump-rope-gazers">13. The Beths — <em>Jump Rope Gazers</em></h3>
<p>There were so many good records two years ago that I ended up appending a ‘next best 30’ list to the main top 20 – that’s how I know that The Beths’ fuzzed-up guitars and playful percussion only just missed a spot on the 2018 list for their debut <em>Future Me Hates Me</em>. The follow-up is a stronger record on which the New Zealand quartet have honed their formidable sense of melody to a fine point.</p>
<p>I’m hearing some that dog. in here, only Elizabeth Stokes’s voice is warmer and lighter than Anna Waronker’s delivery often was. Moments like the vocal somersaults on opener ‘I’m Not Getting Excited’ still thrill me on each listen.</p>
<p>There’s a little dip in quality at the middle of the running order, but it picks right back up with the cheerily plaintive ‘Don’t Go Away’, before heading into album highlight ‘Mars, The God of War’: a sub-three-minute pop rock gem and the best song I know to include the word ‘optometry’.</p>
<h3 id="12-deftones--ohms">12. Deftones — <em>Ohms</em></h3>
<p>As I type this there is a newly released version of Deftones’ best record sat, as yet unheard, on my hard drive. <em>White Pony / Black Stallion</em> is a remaster and a set of remixes in celebration of the 20th anniversary of an album that I would still pack for a desert island.</p>
<p>Deftones are one of the very few bands for whom every one of their records has made my list over the years, so let’s review placements:</p>
<p><em>White Pony</em> 3rd in 2000 ☨<br>
<em>Deftones</em> 12th in 2003;<br>
<em>Saturday Night Wrist</em> 9th in 2006;<br>
<em>Diamond Eyes</em> 9th in 2010;<br>
<em>Koi No Yokan</em> 1st in 2012;<br>
<em>Gore</em> 20th in 2016</p>
<p>When I looked back on the preceding decade in 2005 I also retroactively had their debut <em>Adrenaline</em> 1st for 1995, and the follow-up <em>Around the Fur</em> 3rd for 1997.</p>
<p>But what of the new offering? After flirtations with Bob Ezrin, Nick Raskulinecz, &amp; Matt Hyde on their last four albums, Deftones reunite here with Terry Date: the producer on their first four albums. The result is a record that sounds every bit as brutal and sonically deep as their masterpiece. There’s proof on every track of <em>Ohms</em> that this is a band still able to wrangle cacophony like no one else, threading it through with both taut wires of urgent passion and flowing ribbons of melody.</p>
<p>‘Urantia’ is a Pantera riff being absorbed into a great lost Soundgarden song; ‘Radiant City’ is restless water chopped up by a sea monster moving slowly in the deep. And, title track and closer ‘Ohms’, is the best song they’ve written in two decades.</p>
<p>☨ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m relatively confident that if I reviewed this year now <em>White Pony</em> would take 2nd from Eminem’s <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em> and would be snapping at the heels of Radiohead’s <em>Kid A</em> for the top spot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="11-fiona-apple--fetch-the-bolt-cutters">11. Fiona Apple — <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em></h3>
<p>I don’t know where to begin with this record. After having listened to it dozens of times I still feel like I’m barely finding my way into it. And yet it’s mesmerising and breathtaking in new ways each time I give it the attention it deserves – which is to say, when I can lie down with headphones on and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Apple’s previous album (<em>The Idler Wheel…</em>) ended up 17th on my list in 2012, but only four other records on that list have lasted for me over the eight years since. I’m old friends with that album now, I know the raucous ‘Every Single Night’ and the dizzying ‘Hot Knife’ like old friends. But I still recall when I first encountered the album, and how it took time before confusion gave way to awe. Fiona Apple doesn’t make easily digestible, parseable music. But just as years spent loving <em>Extraordinary Machine</em> (2005) were inadequate preparation for <em>Idler Wheel…</em>, eight years spent in the company of that album wasn’t enough to get my brain ready for <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>.</p>
<p>That’s two paragraphs of preamble to mask the fact that I still don’t really know how to talk about this record, except to say that by the time Apple starts making dolphin noises in the last 20 seconds of opener ‘I Want You To Love Me’, you’re likely either in or out. I, evidently, was in all the way: through the anthem to self belief ‘Shameika’, the self confidence mantra ‘Under the Table’, or the howl in the face of depression ‘Heavy Balloon’.</p>
<p>There is a book to be written about the instrumentation on <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>, the way it’s layered, the way Apple’s voice (often in duplicate or triplicate) weaves in and out of it, the way it seems to fly in the face of conventional time signatures to create music that keeps you guessing even on the fifteenth listen. I’m not music scholar enough to attempt anything close to the analysis this record deserves. This is the best way I can find to phrase it: nothing sounds like a Fiona Apple record, and no other Fiona Apple record sounds quite like this.</p>
<h3 id="10-four-tet--sixteen-oceans">10. Four Tet — <em>Sixteen Oceans</em></h3>
<p>It will be no surprise to find Kieran Hebden occupying a place on this list: previous appearances include <em>There is Love in You</em> (17th in 2010); <em>Pink</em> (10th in 2012); &amp; <em>New Energy</em> (7th in 2017), and I have a feeling that if I were to rewrite the 2013 list now <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> would make an appearance – it’s certainly had more staying power for me than a number of records on that list. Heck, I still play 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> at least a couple of times each year.</p>
<p><em>Sixteen Oceans</em> displays the same delicate balances with which Four Tet has been playing for more than two decades: electronic / acoustic; played / sampled; digital / human. These levels shift pleasingly and subtly throughout the runtime of the record, in a manner which made it for me very much an album as opposed to a collection of disparate tracks. As I replayed it, even the four shorter interstitial pieces came to feel like necessary, brilliantly judged transitional moments.</p>
<p>Highlights for me are the singular pulse of ‘Teenage Birdsong’, and the glowing swell of (the otherwise admittedly slight) ‘4T Recordings’. Arguably there’s less innovation on <em>Sixteen Oceans</em> than there has been on previous Four Tet albums, but I don’t necessarily miss it. I still find Hebden’s work captivating, moving, and worthy of frequent revisiting.</p>
<h3 id="9-caribou--suddenly">9. Caribou — <em>Suddenly</em></h3>
<p>Caribou previously appeared on one of these lists when he took 11th place in 2014 with <em>Our Love</em>. That was a record that tapped into hazy house music vibes to great effect, and there are still notes of that in evidence on this year’s release. Overall, however, <em>Suddenly</em> is more wide-ranging. It borrows from all over the dance / electronica spectrum, and unifies the results by threading the patchwork through with Dan Snaith’s falsetto.</p>
<p>Album highlight ‘Home’ is as soulful and warm as opener ‘Sister’ is cool and stand-offish: both are sub-three minute musical jewels. Each track here has been painstakingly constructed from a broad array of influences, such that each sounds different from one another and yet uniquely like Caribou. It’s a similar art to that practiced by (former tour mates) Radiohead: somehow you know a piece of music is theirs even when it sounds unlike anything they’ve made before. Amongst my favourite tracks on the record, ‘Never Come Back’ &amp; ‘Ravi’ are imbued with the kind of warmth that just glows through your headphones.</p>
<h3 id="8-haim--women-in-music-pt-iii">8. HAIM — <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em></h3>
<p>HAIM’s last album — <em>Something To Tell You</em> — didn’t find a spot on my 2017 list. Despite a handful of very good tracks, and no outright bad ones, it never seemed to reach anything like the heights of the debut: <em>Days Are Gone</em>, which was awarded 6th place back in 2013. Even on first listen it was clear to me that on <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em> HAIM had recaptured the magic of their debut.</p>
<p>The formula should be familiar now: three gifted musicians who also hold the unfair advantage of being sisters, which seems to explain why their voices harmonise so perfectly. Using those tools, and a great ear for melodic hooks, they produce a more thoroughly Californian update of Fleetwood Mac’s blues-infused pop-rock.</p>
<p>And on their third LP they’re making some of their best music. ‘The Steps’ is forthright and foot-stomping; its younger sister – album closer ‘FUBT’ – is a more vulnerable lament. And HAIM are happy and able to play anywhere along that spectrum. Album highlight ‘Don’t Wanna’ is both achingly sweet and vulnerable whilst its percussion and soaring chorus project a core of strength.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of surprises that work surprisingly well: chief amongst them ‘3am’, which sounds like it fell off a Jennifer Lopez record a couple of decades ago, and which I couldn’t get enough of.</p>
<h3 id="7-georgia--seeking-thrills">7. Georgia — <em>Seeking Thrills</em></h3>
<p>Only two of the dozen nominees for this year’s Mercury Music Prize also has the (no less prestigious) honour of being awarded a place in my top 20.</p>
<p><em>Seeking Thrills</em> is one of the year’s most optimistic records; it’s awash with infectious positivity. There are certainly downtempo moments, such as the coy, understated self-belief mantra ‘Till I Own It’, but there are several tracks obviously destined to soundtrack late night and early hours on dancefloors. The chorus of ‘Never Let You Go’ is a burst of beautiful euphoria set in a polyrhythmic bed that’s urging you to dance at two different tempos at once; ‘Feel It’ has the DNA of an MIA track, but with a dance twist; ’24 Hours’ evolves masterfully into an effervescent gem.</p>
<p>The first half of the album is stronger than the latter half, but there are no weak tracks. Since its release in the second week of the year this has been an easy-listening pleasure that I’ve yet to tire of replaying.</p>
<h3 id="6-taylor-swift--evermore">6. Taylor Swift — <em>evermore</em></h3>
<p>This has been the year of disrupted plans and unforeseen twists. Thus it’s fitting that I had this whole list written before Taylor Swift decided to celebrate her birthday by surprise releasing an album, with ~16 hours' notice, on 11 December. Hence, two weeks’ later, here I am on Boxing Day re-writing things to give this record its rightful place.</p>
<p>As with her other quarantine album (July’s <em>folklore</em>) this is Swift in a storytelling mode, delicately and precisely teasing out the emotional truths of any situation she turns her attention to: failed proposals on ‘champagne problems’, imbalances of affection within relationships on ‘tolerate it’ . She’s telling the story of her own grandmother on ‘marjorie’, and spinning a tale of murder and revenge on the HAIM-featuring ‘No Body, No Crime’ – both the most fun Swift had on record this year, and her catchiest song of 2020.</p>
<p>Sonically though, there’s more of a sense of exploration here than on Swift’s other 2020 release. The template of simply arranged, delicately composed folk pop that was set on <em>folklore</em> is pulled here into slightly different shapes. There’s a drum machine on ‘one story short’, and skittering beats and whooshes underneath the outro of ‘happiness’, and again throughout ‘closure’. There’s one of the clearest nods to her country music roots since <em>Speak Now</em> (2010) on ‘cowboy like me’.</p>
<p>You can probably tell from how this entry is written that, with five entries left to go, we’re not done with Taylor Swift in 2020. I’ll have more to say then.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Also: shout out to the Detroit post-hardcore quartet Dogleg who held the 20th spot on this list before Taylor dropped a last minute bombshell, necessitating a re-write; their debut <em>Melee</em> is officially my twenty-first favourite LP of 2020.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="5-hayley-williams--petals-for-armor">5. Hayley Williams — <em>Petals for Armor</em></h3>
<p>The last three Paramore records have been at four year intervals (not that I’m counting down), and they’ve reliably taken their place in the middle of my lists: 8th in 2009 for <em>Brand New Eyes</em>, 12th in 2013 for <em>Paramore</em>, and 10th in 2017 with <em>After Laughter</em>. As such it’s a welcome surprise to find frontwoman Hayley Williams so far up this list when she’s out on her own.</p>
<p>Musically this solo work is less vibrantly bombastic than Paramore’s more recent output, but no less catchy or endearing. Despite deeply personal subject matter (including depression, divorce, and recovery) Williams has crafted a collection of electronic-tinged pop-rock that it’s impossible not to fall for. Over the course of 15 tracks she explores some more experimental percussion and production (such as on the stuttering-then-flowing, Fiona Apple-esque ‘Cinnamon’) as well as showcasing her ear for a hook, such as on the powerful earworm ‘Dead Horse’ and the Sunday-afternoon radio ballad ‘Pure Love’. The result is an hour of consistently arresting, energising music that draws from an impressively wide emotional range.</p>
<p>Few would deny that the defining characteristic of Paramore as a band is Hayley Williams’s unmistakable voice. Whisper to roar, and across a truly impressive tonal range, few rock singers can match her. Unsurprisingly that is also the strength of her first solo outing, though her consistently evolving songwriting is a close second.</p>
<h3 id="4-beach-bunny--honeymoon">4. Beach Bunny — <em>Honeymoon</em></h3>
<p>This record is nine tracks and 25 minutes of relentless, sunny pop-rock. It’s proof if proof was needed that throwing four kids into a rehearsal room with a couple of guitars and a drum set can still result in something life-affirming and marvellous.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Promises’ is first light and bubbly, and then strident and anthemic; it’s followed up with the sing-along whilst you dance-along ‘Cuffing Season’, then we drop a couple of gears for the raw, earnest ‘April’. And we’re off to the races on a giddy whirlwind tour of three-chords-and-hummable-choruses pop. By the time you reach cartwheeling closer, and album high point, ‘Cloud 9’ you’re ready to do it all again. Go on, treat yourself. You can find 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I’m a simple man, and Weezer’s self-titled debut is my seventh-favourite record of all time. I needed something this bright and uncomplicated this year, and my thanks go out to this Chicago quartet for delivering it so effectively.</p>
<h3 id="3-taylor-swift--folklore">3. Taylor Swift — <em>folklore</em></h3>
<p>Last year’s number one released this record with 24 hours’ notice back in July, and it has been a staple on my headphones ever since. A very different-sounding record to 2019’s <em>Lover</em>, working (for the most part) in a more subdued register, <em>folklore</em> is another showcase for a phenomenal songwriting talent. There are no anthemic, danceable pop explosions here, but the more muted tone and stripped back instrumentation allow for Swift’s vocals to shine, and for her lyricism to take centre stage.</p>
<p>Whether it’s (on ‘The Last Great American Dynasty’) telling the story of Rebekah Harkness, who used to live in the home Swift now owns, or laying out the dynamics of a love triangle over the course of three songs (‘Cardigan’, ‘August’, &amp; ‘Betty’), Swift displays a songwriting touch as light and dextrous as the voice with which she brings those songs to life. Album highlight for me (at least at present) is Swift’s duet with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon on ‘Exile’ - a lyrically exquisite heartbreaker wherein the two voices play with and against one another perfectly.</p>
<p>Following the surprise release of the album, Swift also put out a combination making-of documentary / live performance on Disney+ which offered insight on how the record came to be, and how her collaboration with The National’s Aaron Dessner came to bear this fruit. It also serves as an interesting document of how an artist usually wrapped in layers of hype and marketing, found freedom in isolation to make something intimate. The record is a fascinating balance: it represents the furthest Swift has gone into telling others’ stories (fictional and otherwise), yet each song is imbued with deeply personal feeling.</p>
<p>Swift’s work in 2020 has been, frankly, stunning - as evidenced by her having performed the unprecedented feat of securing two spots in the top six places of this list. Having stepped outside of both the aesthetic trappings and sonic bombast usually expected of pop’s reigning queen, she has made a strong case for being recognised as a generational songwriting talent.</p>
<h3 id="2-halsey--manic">2. Halsey — <em>Manic</em></h3>
<p>When you open your third record on a song titled with your given name (‘Ashley’) you’re making a statement: I’m here to share something; this is coming from the heart. When you close that track with a snippet of audio from <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, you’re signalling an emotional register of earnest vulnerability. Carrying off that conversation over the course of 16 pop songs is a tall order, and yet <em>Manic</em> is an unbridled success.</p>
<p>Someone smarter than me could probably take the musical DNA of ‘Forever … (is a long time)’ / ‘Dominic’s Interlude’ / ‘I HATE EVERYBODY’, examine it under an electron microscope, and figure out why it makes me feel the same way as sections of My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> (2006). I’m not equipped to work out the reasons, I can just tell you that it happens. The first track uses piano to effect a shift from major to minor key; the second is an organ-backed, multi-tracked, 76 second opera;  the third is a series of crescendos hitting like waves on a beach. It’s a masterful seven minutes at the centre of a bewilderingly good record.</p>
<p>Oh, and then the second half of the record kicks off with the barnstorming pop-rock ‘3am’, and then the dimly lit, sultry ‘Without Me’, then the lost KT Tunstall track I didn’t know I wanted: ‘Finally // beautiful stranger’. By the time Halsey is singing an LGBT empowerment duet with Alanis Morissette you feel it’s company they should feel comfortable keeping.</p>
<p>Folk, pop, indie rock, R&amp;B, Korean rap - this record includes a lot, and some reviews read that as coming at the expense of depth. For me it all works seamlessly almost without exception, making <em>Manic</em> read like a personal, and deeply felt record, that also happens to be a pop gem.</p>
<h3 id="1-dua-lipa--future-nostalgia">1. Dua Lipa — <em>Future Nostalgia</em></h3>
<p>Here’s the other Mercury nominee, and (I have just learned) Spotify’s most played female artist of 2020. So firmly is the 2020 pop crown sat atop Dua’s head that one of her best tracks of the year isn’t even on this record, it’s over on Miley Cyrus’s <em>Plastic Hearts</em> - the high point of an album that very nearly made this list.</p>
<p>Whilst Taylor Swift was writing folk ballads in a woodland cabin it seems Dua was channeling the attentions of the pop gods to teach a neon-soaked masterclass in funk and disco-infused bangers. This is music designed in a lab to destroy radios, dance floors, and TikTok alike. All of which would be for nothing if it wasn’t, from start to finish, an unmitigated success. You cannot fail to smile, you absolutely will nod along, sing along, and feel some of these beats in your bones.</p>
<p>The Pitchfork review of <em>Future Nostalgia</em> has a good line in which they say that the album ‘sounds like three Madonna eras at once’. As someone who has a huge amount of affection for pretty much all of Madonna’s eras (not you <em>American Life</em>, you can sit down) this is a recipe for success in my mind. Providing, that is, that you can walk in Madonna’s shadow – not an easy thing to do. Dua comes armed with the disco beats of peak Kylie, and a faultless ear for both a groove and a beat. The result is a remarkable pop record that samples White Town on ‘Love Again’, and channels John Deacon on ‘Break My Heart’, but also sounds entirely cohesive and possessed of limitless self-confidence.</p>
<p>The title track, ‘Don’t Start Now’, ‘Physical’, ‘Hallucinate’, and ‘Break My Heart’ could each be career-defining encores for a lot of artists. As it stands, I get the feeling that this is just the beginning of what Dua Lipa is capable of.<br>

<p>This is the second year that my list has been topped by a thoroughbred pop record, and there are more albums elsewhere on the list this year than ever before which fall in that category. What I find particularly interesting is that the great bulk of my music-listening year is taken up with records from all over the genre map. At the time of writing I’ve listened to 213 records released in 2020 at least once through. From ambient and drone to jazz and metal I found records this year that I really enjoyed. But when the chips are down and I have to pick the records that genuinely gave me the most pleasure, increasingly it’s pop music that I turn to. Perhaps two years in a row is a coincidence, but even if the 2021 list doesn’t end up having a pop album on top I’ll be shocked if there isn’t a handful of them in the mix.</p>

			 <p>I like to listen to music when I write, but it has to be music that fits certain criteria: I&rsquo;m looking for something fairly down-tempo or ambient, instrumental as opposed to anything with lyrics, and nothing with prominent percussion. Over the years I&rsquo;ve experimented with various ways of streaming endless amounts of this stuff without having to pick a new album every hour, and I thought I&rsquo;d list a few of those solutions here in case you&rsquo;re looking for something similar.</p>
<p>Early on I found the super-popular YouTube channel ChilledCow, and specifically the always live continuous stream <a href="https://youtu.be/jfKfPfyJRdk">&lsquo;lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to&rsquo;</a>, which routinely has tens of thousands of people tuned into it. A cute, looping cartoon of a cozy setting, and an uninterrupted current of minimal beats; I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is the stream that originated the formula, but it&rsquo;s the one that seems to be most copied. (If you don’t want to keep a tab open to YouTube at all times they also have <a href="https://fanlink.to/chilledcow-music">curated playlists</a> on most audio streaming platforms.)</p>
<p>Tangentially related: in this era of not being able to go out and sit in a coffee shop, I recently came across this <a href="https://youtu.be/c0_ejQQcrwI">8-hour coffee shop ambience video</a> which makes for excellent background audio if that&rsquo;s an atmosphere you work well in, or one that you just miss being in. (Fellow <em>Twin Peaks</em> fans: there’s also <a href="https://youtu.be/npVellnR6D8">a version featuring the Double R Diner</a>!)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;s less about music and more about pure ambience, I&rsquo;ve had good results with <a href="https://noiz.io">Noizio</a> – a macOS app with which you can mix and match from several sound sources: a campfire, October rain, white noise etc. It might take a little work to find a balance that works for you, but once you locate that sweet spot it’s quite effective.</p>
<p>Speaking of pure ambience: for something similar, though less customisable, I’ve also dipped into some of <a href="https://pca.st/4X9F">these white noise and ambience podcasts</a>. At an hour each they’re not ideal for endless play, but are well designed for listening to whilst you’re drifting towards sleep.</p>
<p>OK, I’ve front-loaded this list with free and cheap solutions, but I have to include a subscription-based service since it’s the one I’ve relied most upon for some time. With a much-improved front end, and with <a href="https://www.brain.fm/science">some fancy science behind it</a>, I can attest to the efficacy of (app &amp; web service) <a href="https://brain.fm">Brain.fm</a>. I was gifted a lifetime subscription a few years ago, and I&rsquo;d estimate that I wrote about 75% of my novel&rsquo;s first draft with this as background audio. Unlike any of the above it’s very difficult to describe quite what Brain.fm sounds like, but I strongly recommend you try out the free sessions next time you need to concentrate on something for an extended period.</p>
<p>Bonus pick: not strictly ambience for writing to (or doing much else to), but I&rsquo;ve also recently enjoyed a couple of these first person urban walking videos, such as this <a href="https://youtu.be/E2sSvVCRI4s">75 minute amble through London&rsquo;s West End on a rainy evening</a>. No commentary or music, just pure city ambience. It&rsquo;s not the real thing, but it&rsquo;s been a neat reminder of pre-pandemic normalcy.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/06/23/naughty-dog-the.html">Naughty Dog — The Last of Us Part II (2020)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/06/23/naughty-dog-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-22 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Jun 22, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As someone who genuinely loves video games, and who feels invested in what they can do and be – as well as how they&rsquo;re evolving – I feel bad about skipping <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>
<p>I never owned a PlayStation 3, and so my initial contact with the original game was as this heralded title – a marked step forward in interactive narratives – that I couldn&rsquo;t play. I picked up the &lsquo;Remastered&rsquo; edition for PlayStation 4 around five years ago, and I&rsquo;m a little ashamed to say that I&rsquo;ve never finished it.</p>
<p>With a handful of notable exceptions (<em>Metal Gear Solid</em> (1998); <em>Mark of the Ninja</em> (2012) etc.) stealth games have never really been precisely my cup of tea. I found that the difficulty ramp and resource scarcity in <em>The Last of Us</em> made clear that stealth was the proper way to play it, and when I messed up — frequently — I felt punished in a non-negotiable way. Encounters felt binary: successfully find the correct path along which to sneak, or otherwise expend ammunition and healing resources. If the latter, the margin of error on subsequent encounters was shrunk even thinner. As effective as I found its storytelling to be, its primary gameplay mechanics left me frustrated.</p>
<p>Reviews for the new game are — not unexpectedly — stellar; at the time of writing it has a Metacritic score of 96% aggregated from 91 outlets. That feels about as close to a &lsquo;must play&rsquo; as you can get, and yet some reviews [<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxqnxy/last-of-us-part-2-review">2</a>] give me pause. The game sounds absolutely unrelenting and brutal. That&rsquo;s a choice of tone that certainly fits the story it&rsquo;s telling and the world it&rsquo;s building, but which makes the experience feel ill suited to the current moment. Take this from Waypoint&rsquo;s review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is over two dozen hours of spiraling cycles of violence and vengeance, being reminded roughly every hour that the whole endeavor is squalid and cruel. There is hardly a moment of joy it will not eventually curdle. A truly shocking number of characters that you will come to care about will be gruesomely mutilated, or slaughtered, or both. All of it is utterly predictable, or if you’re feeling charitable, tragically fated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds like hard work. I&rsquo;m simultaneously glad that Naughty Dog have pushed their game that far, and sure that this isn&rsquo;t a game for me. It&rsquo;s an encouraging sign of the medium&rsquo;s burgeoning maturity that there is space in video games for a AAA title to explore this emotional territory, but I find myself unwilling to take the journey right now. I know I&rsquo;ll be missing out on something special, and that by doing so I&rsquo;m placing myself on the outside of a conversation that will be ongoing for a while. There&rsquo;s certainly a pull to play the game simply <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s going to be a landmark, but I don&rsquo;t feel it strongly enough at present to invest the time or emotional labour.</p>
<p>(That is a <a href="https://twitter.com/R_Nikaido/status/1274142361635876866?s=20">very impressive cable</a> though.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This was a suggestion from a friend, based upon the format of the podcast <a href="https://shows.acast.com/teenagemixtape"><em>Teenage Mixtape</em></a>, wherein guests name a track for each of 10 criteria:</p>
<p>1 — The first single you bought<br>
2 — The first gig you went to<br>
3 — A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents<br>
4 — A song that reminds you of a teenage crush<br>
5 — A song that reminds you of your partner (or an ex)<br>
6 — A song that you wish you could play on guitar<br>
7 — A song that you hope never to hear again<br>
8 — A guilty pleasure<br>
9 — The opposite of a guilty pleasure (ie. an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)<br>
10 — A song you&rsquo;re listening to currently</p>
<p>So here we go, the most uneven playlist I think I&rsquo;ve ever made, with liner notes below.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1-first-single-you-ever-bought">1. First single you ever bought</h3>
<p><strong>Whitney Houston: ‘I Will Always Love You’</strong> — I can’t swear to this being the absolute first single I bought, but it’s the first I <em>remember</em> buying. It would have been during the song’s 23-week run on the UK chart between November 1992 and April 1993, and I distinctly recall that my two purchases from the Hereford branch of Our Price that day were this single, and the <em>Love Symbol</em> album by Prince &amp; the New Power Generation.</p>
<p>This is obviously a flawless vocal performance by Houston, of whom my dad was a fan but to whom I paid too little attention into my 30s. (Both <em>Whitney Houston</em> (1985) and <em>Whitney</em> (1987) recently warranted re-listens when assessing my favourite records of the 1980s.)</p>
<p>Ironically: I prefer the Dolly Parton original of this song these days.<br>
Double ironically: I’ve never seen <em>The Bodyguard</em>!</p>
<h3 id="2-the-first-gig-you-ever-went-to">2. The first gig you ever went to</h3>
<p><strong>M People: ‘Don’t Look Any Further’</strong> — St David’s Hall, Cardiff. 1994? ‘Moving On Up’ and ‘Search for the Hero’ had the radio ubiquity, but whenever my dad would play the album, it was this song that captured my imagination. It is, as they say, still a bop.</p>
<p>In keeping with the previous track, my preference these days is for the Dennis Edwards original principally because of <a href="https://youtu.be/E7t8eoA_1jQ">its bassline</a>, and in spite of its <a href="https://youtu.be/CH3rx8LhrQo">mind-bendingly bad music video</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-one-or-both-of-your-parents">3. A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents</h3>
<p><strong>The Carpenters: ‘Top of the World’</strong> — I may not have agreed to this if I’d known it would lead to floods of tears. I haven’t played this since my mum’s funeral, and I will never not think of her when I hear anything by The Carpenters. On a related note, this is why art is so very important: it provides intangible, permanent connection to things that we’ve otherwise lost, and a means through which to feel and express things we otherwise aren’t sure how to.</p>
<h3 id="4-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-a-teenage-crush">4. A song that reminds you of a teenage crush</h3>
<p><strong>Portishead: ‘Glory Box’</strong> — my first relationship that lasted more than a couple of months was with a very sweet, tomboyish girl. A few of our friendship group were very into Portishead’s first record, but I remember distinctly that she connected deeply with this particular song. Somehow it made more sense to me after she broke our relationship off, and began seeing a girl.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-your-partner">5. A song that reminds you of your partner</h3>
<p><strong>The White Stripes: ‘The Air Near My Fingers’</strong> — My partner recently estimated that I spend 70% of my time thinking about food, and the rest thinking about her. Those percentages are wrong, but the sentiment isn’t. As such I don’t really need <em>reminding</em> of her, but here’s the song I associate most acutely with our early relationship. <em>Elephant</em> was the record that soundtracked a lot of what you might call our courtship, and this song in particular – with its refrain: “I get nervous when she comes around” – is 100% tied up with what it felt like getting to know her, and falling in love with her.</p>
<h3 id="6-a-song-that-you-wish-you-could-play-on-guitar">6. A song that you wish you could play on guitar</h3>
<p><strong>Prince’s contribution to ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ from the 2004 Rock Hall of Fame induction ceremony</strong> — I can’t play any songs on guitar, so I’m shooting for <a href="https://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y">the heavens</a> on the understanding that if I could play this, I could play anything else I darn well pleased. I honestly can’t think of another single piece of guitar playing that is this transcendent. If I dedicated the rest of my life solely to learning this one guitar part I honestly don’t think I would ever get there. And even if I did, I still wouldn’t be able to <a href="https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/tom-petty-and-others-tell-the-story-behind-princes-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-solo">make guitars magically disappear</a> into thin air.</p>
<p>Side note: my second choice is Prince’s performance of <a href="https://youtu.be/7NN3gsSf-Ys">‘Purple Rain’</a> at the 2007 Super Bowl.</p>
<h3 id="7-a-song-that-you-hope-never-to-hear-again">7. A song that you hope never to hear again</h3>
<p><strong>Foghat: ‘Slow Ride’</strong> — Firstly, this isn’t a good song. It’s a bad song. But there are other bad songs of its calibre: ‘House of the Rising Sun’, ‘The Girl from Ipanema’, and ‘Hotel California’ could all disappear from the Earth today and I’d be quite happy never to hear them ever again. I’m choosing the Foghat track for one specific reason: I must have listened to it upwards of 100 times, sometimes ~20 times in a row, whilst trying to 5-star it on <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em> (which I never did). The song sucks. Please erase it from existence.</p>
<h3 id="8-a-guilty-pleasure">8. A guilty pleasure</h3>
<p>This is the first tough one; I don’t really feel any guilt about taking pleasure in art. I’ll tell anyone who will listen that Madonna’s ‘Borderline’ (<em>Immaculate Collection</em> Remix (1990)) is my favourite song. Would you like to hear about why Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Cut to the Feeling’ is a masterpiece? Do you want to discuss how Meatloaf’s 12 minute rock opera classic ‘I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)’ is, if anything, too short?</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel more reticence naming My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> as my favourite album because it carries all sorts of connotations with which I don’t entirely associate. But do I feel guilty? No your honour, I do not.</p>
<p>So here’s the best I’ve got: <strong>Michael Jackson: ‘Leave Me Alone’</strong> — my favourite song by an artist I adored in the formative years of my music listening, and defended vociferously in the midst of allegations against him in the mid 90s. The music is still very special to me today, but that relationship is — obviously — more complicated now, and I’m not as firmly in the habit of loudly proclaiming my love of Michael Jackson as I once was.</p>
<h3 id="9-the-opposite-of-a-guilty-pleasure-ie-an-artistsong-you-didnt-like-but-pretended-to-like-to-look-cool">9. The opposite of a guilty pleasure (i.e., an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)</h3>
<p>I’m glad this is framed in the past tense, because (as above) I’m not someone who feels any guilt about the art they do or don’t like. That wasn’t always the case, however!</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 90s I had a circle of friends that were primarily into metal. I certainly loved a good number of bands under that label (Metallica, Sepultura, Korn et al) but for the most part my tastes paddled out of the shallow end to only chest-deep water. I was the grunge kid of the group really, but despite that being evidenced by my wearing petticoats and tights to club nights, for some reason I felt the need to at least pretend that I was on board with whatever the others were listening to. When you’re a skinny fifteen year old wearing a woman’s undergarment and mascara, and a six foot guy in all black leather is smoking directly into your face and telling you Cradle of Filth are the best band in the world, sometimes you bite your tongue and nod. So, here you go, enjoy: <strong>Cradle of Filth: ‘Forest Whispers My Name’</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="10-a-song-youre-currently-listening-to">10. A song you&rsquo;re currently listening to</h3>
<p>Oh shoot, so many options. Plus I feel an obligation to try and rescue this (very uneven) playlist from the clutches of Dani Filth. Let’s keep it simple: my favourite song from 2020 at the time of writing. Kill ‘em Selena: <strong>Selena Gomez: ‘Dance Again’</strong></p>

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/06/20/favourite-films.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-19 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Jun 19, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As visitors to this site may know, my friend James and I have a ritual of exchanging &lsquo;Top 20&rsquo; lists of our favourite albums at the end of each year. (All of those can be found <a href="/thelists">here</a>.) Since this year marks the <em>twentieth</em> anniversary of that tradition, we decided to branch out a little and add in some additional mid-year lists. So here&rsquo;s the first of two, listing my favourite 20 films.</p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of brainstorming, shortlisting, and hand-wringing. This list is firmly timestamped <strong>20 June 2020</strong>; positions are mutable, and there are 100 movies tied for the number 21 spot, any one of which could sneak on here on the right day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I approached this as a fan of <em>Drive</em> (2011) and someone who pulled a confused face through most of <em>Only God Forgives</em> (2013). Happily <em>The Neon Demon</em> took me on a ride that I won&rsquo;t soon forget. Alongside one other (in some respects curiously similar) film, this is the closest I get to horror on this list, but I have a hard time thinking of it that way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a perfect example of a small, personal movie that transcends niche subject matter to feel universal. (See also <em>Rocky</em>). I could watch this 100 times just for JK Simmons&rsquo;s performance – one of the most compelling characters of modern cinema.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Famously this was a higher budget project with (even) more high profile stars attached, and then it fell apart. I cannot for the life of me imagine a version of this movie without these central performances, or the settings exactly as they are.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t Aronofsky&rsquo;s only appearance on this list, and with the notable exception of <em>Noah</em> (2014) he&rsquo;s possibly the director I feel most in tune with.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s not much left to be said about <em>Rocky</em>. Even today it feels like lightning in a bottle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The peaks of cinematic style over the last 30 years feature <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (1994), <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), and this film. Pitch perfect soundtrack, understated performances, beautiful camerawork, one of the best opening sequences ever. Re-watch it, I virtually guarantee it&rsquo;s even better than you remember.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe, just maybe, the best central performance of my lifetime, and that&rsquo;s just one component of a masterful film. I find a new shot to marvel at on each re-watch, and Jonny Greenwood&rsquo;s score is jaw dropping all by itself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Flash back to 8 year old Adam for whom his stuffed Roger Rabbit and the cardboard Benny the Cab in which it arrived were prized possessions. This is a magical movie entirely in love with movie magic at every level, and it remains an absolute pleasure.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I saw this on my 30th birthday at Curzon Soho and it absolutely stunned me. I was already an avowed Aronofsky fan by that point, but this film – which I read as an urgent female revision of <em>Fight Club</em> (1999) – locked him in as the most vital of working directors. (I wrote a review <a href="/blackswan">here</a>.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As with many people, one of the most formative films of my youth. I just about wore out the taped-from-TV copy that had an almost permanent home in our top-loading Betamax. Eventually this would lead me to Spielberg, then Coppola, then everything else!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the time I saw this I knew <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> inside out and back to front, and I was still blown away by the music of Tarantino&rsquo;s script. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the film&rsquo;s cultural impact, since it&rsquo;s now woven into the fabric of much that followed. For me too it remains a touchstone film that also happens to be a darn good time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An audacious masterpiece featuring a career best performance from Keaton, surrounded by other brilliant performances by Norton, Stone et al. It&rsquo;s smart, dark, funny, and the score is a part of the picture in a way I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt before. You could entirely lose the &lsquo;no cuts&rsquo; device and still have a wonderful film. As it stands it&rsquo;s also a profound piece of art about authenticity and performance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can argue about whether it&rsquo;s one film or two, but Tarantino&rsquo;s on my side so I&rsquo;ll win. This is the best picture by one of the most vital, inventive directors in cinema history. That it comes in the form of a funny, beautifully shot, blood-soaked martial arts epic is just a bonus to my way of thinking. No one has made a movie like this since; my fingers ache from having been crossed for so long at the prospect of the long-rumoured third instalment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone was really ready for <em>The Matrix</em>, but I certainly wasn&rsquo;t. When it came out I was preoccupied checking the (janky, infant) web for anything I could learn about <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. Later that year, in what felt like the space of a week, I&rsquo;d have my mind blown by <em>Fight Club</em>, and my nerves shredded by <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. But it&rsquo;s <em>The Matrix</em> that changed everything. Its impact on wider culture is astounding, let alone what it did to action films, and it remains timelessly cool and perfectly structured to this day - honestly I don&rsquo;t think a movie has been released since that balances style and substance this well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the most transcendent cinema-going experiences of my life. An unalloyed joy from beginning to end, with one of the most charming central performances imaginable. It&rsquo;s about growing up too slowly and falling behind and not fitting in and feeling completely adrift, and trying to make peace with it. Despite all the ways I&rsquo;m different to Frances, I&rsquo;ve rarely felt so seen in (or reassured by) a piece of art.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t born when <em>Close Encounters&hellip;</em> came out, and I was only an infant when <em>ET</em> was released. This was my Spielberg movie, and my first summer blockbuster. The first film for which I pored over every magazine article, collected stickers, bought the &lsquo;making of&rsquo; and &lsquo;art of&rsquo; books. It remains an example of perfectly crafted, immaculate cinema.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I enjoy a jump-scare-filled slasher movie as much as the next person, but nothing comes close to this for me in terms of inducing sheer dread. A masterpiece of mood setting and audience manipulation, with an unbelievable career-best central performance from Jennifer Lawrence. Aronofsky&rsquo;s use of his set — the way the house changes throughout — is spellbinding, and his pacing is superb. And the sheer audacity to go as far as this film goes is stunning. The most potent metaphor for the creative process imaginable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I re-watch this every 2 February as though it were a religious holiday. Tonally flawless, with a Bill Murray performance for the ages. It does a remarkable job of getting to the human centre of its high concept premise. Ironically it remains endlessly re-watchable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The best comedy ever made. Flawless script, flawless performances, and a sense of the world that is entirely its own. There are weirder Coens' movies; there are probably more inventive Coens' movies, but this is the one they will almost certainly never top. If I could only take one movie to a desert island, this might be it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Take a sci-fi concept, sprinkle in Greek myth, add Huey Lewis and the News&hellip; you&rsquo;re part way to making a flawless masterpiece of family cinema. Whether it&rsquo;s Zemeckis &amp; Bob Gale&rsquo;s script; Fox, Lloyd, and Thompson&rsquo;s performances; the soundtrack; the visual design, or (most likely) a combination of all those elements, the film is imbued with an undiminished warmth. (The recent <a href="https://youtu.be/crdYIUdUOhc">&lsquo;Reunited Apart&rsquo; episode</a> with the cast and crew is the best thing to come out of COVID-19 lockdown.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me personally this is the most awe &amp; wonder per foot of celluloid I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. AT-ATs; Yoda; the cave; &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; / &ldquo;I know&rdquo;; the duel on Cloud City; &ldquo;Luke, I am your father&rdquo;&hellip;. Absolutely unbeatable.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s only right for me to point out that I&rsquo;m aware this list is overwhelmingly populated by white men; in fact the Wachowskis &amp; Alejandro González Iñárritu are the only people here that fall outside of that category. Heck, Iñárritu &amp; Nicolas Winding Refn are the only directors from outside of the US!</p>
<p>If this were a longer list you would see names like Kelly Reichardt, Sofia Coppola, Greta Gerwig, Olivier Assayas, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alfred Hitchcock, and Michel Gondry. The first Black person&rsquo;s name would likely be John Singleton, Steve McQueen, or Spike Lee. But you&rsquo;d also see a lot more white, American men. I hold my hand up: I can be faulted for having not watched widely enough. Additionally, there are certainly systemic forces at play in terms of the sheer number of films made by the one group, particularly during the period in which I was falling in love with cinema.</p>

			 <p>Having gradually become used to the sight of emptied streets, it is shocking to see them suddenly so full. And, in contrast to the selfishness of those who failed to heed public health advice in the preceding months, these are congregations expressing solidarity, and truly in pursuit of a greater good.</p>
<p>Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark and powerful reminder of our shared humanity, it has also provided a reminder that <a href="https://people.com/health/black-americans-disproportionally-affected-by-coronavirus-study-shows/">vulnerability is not distributed equitably</a>. Income inequality, food insecurity, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247405204_Rethinking_Environmental_Racism_White_Privilege_and_Urban_Development_in_Southern_California">environmental injustice</a>, and numerous other factors have contributed to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200420-coronavirus-why-some-racial-groups-are-more-vulnerable">disproportionately high suffering amongst Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities</a> throughout the pandemic. And then came the merciless and unjustifiable killing of George Floyd in a Minneapolis street. An echo of too many needless deaths, which has resulted in widespread protest across the United States and in countries around the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine a more urgent, just cause for which to come together even when to do so has become anathema. That these protests are occurring over the 99th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre">Tulsa race massacre</a> is but one grim reminder of the persistence of racial inequality and systemic racism.</p>
<p>In the first days of the protests I didn&rsquo;t feel as though I had a great deal to contribute save for my attention. However, it has begun to feel as though silence is a shade of apathy, and so this post exists as a simple acknowledgment of — and declaration of support for  — the cause of racial justice and equality. In addition to which, I wanted to share a handful of ways in which anyone and everyone can help.</p>
<p>In the immediate term, if you would like to make a monetary contribution you can perhaps <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd">split a donation across more than 70 community bail funds</a>. You can also help simply by buying yourself some music from Bandcamp on 19 June: <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-naacp-ldf-fundraiser">details here</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have money to spare, but you have some time, you could <a href="https://twitter.com/thEMANacho/status/1267609472589090816?s=20">watch this 10 minute video</a>; <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/keep-the-fight-with-justine-barron-and-amelia-mcdonell-parry/">listen to this podcast</a>; or turn your next movie night into a documentary night with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/racial-injustice-documentaries/?europe=true">suggestions like these</a>. In addition to which – at the very least – you can use your social platforms to <strong>listen to and amplify black voices</strong>.</p>
<p>When you are able to invest more time, it is my unflagging belief that ignorance is powerless in the face of books. Here are some that I can personally vouch for, and which I feel have helped to broaden my own understanding:</p>
<p>• Frederick Douglass — <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em> (1845);<br>
• Zora Neale Hurston — <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> (1937);<br>
• Richard Wright — <em>Black Boy</em> (1945);<br>
• Toni Morrison — <em>Beloved</em> (1987);<br>
• Ta-Nehisi Coates — <em>Between the World and Me</em> (2015)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also point you to excellent lists <a href="https://twitter.com/victoriaalxndr/status/1266829408268095493?s=21">like this one</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ariannarebolini/george-floyd-amy-cooper-antiracist-books-reading-resources">this one</a> by people who are far better educated on the subject.</p>
<p>The sheer scale of problems like these can engender feelings of helplessness. But fatalistic acceptance of the <em>status quo</em> as intractable is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the most effective cure for feelings of helplessness, is to do whatever little you can to help.</p>

			 <p>Generally speaking I subscribe to the belief that listicles are one of the worst aspects of the modern internet, and I avoid them with an appropriate sense of horror. However, I wanted to share this list by Kevin Kelly (co-founder of <em>Wired</em> magazine, amongst other things), which he recently posted to <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/">his blog</a> to mark his 68th birthday. It&rsquo;s titled &lsquo;68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice&rsquo;, and it contains many concise, powerful entries that I certainly felt I gained from reading.</p>
<p>Take for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spend some time with the full list <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">here</a>, or watch Kelly recite it from a rocking chair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz70rcguxwk&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/05/10/jenny-offill-weather.html">Jenny Offill — Weather (2020)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/05/10/jenny-offill-weather.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-05-09 23:00:00 &#43;0000">May 9, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="/uploads/2023/f65a97cf84.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I spent Sunday afternoon between the armchair and the sofa, reading Jenny Offill&rsquo;s latest novel: <em>Weather</em>. Her previous – <em>Dept. of Speculation</em> (2014) – was a novel I picked up in a book shop because of its cover, and purchased immediately upon reading its first three sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antelopes have 10x vision, you said. It was the beginning or close to it. That means that on a clear night they can see the rings of Saturn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was thrilled by something on almost every page of that novel. Offill&rsquo;s writing is concise and incisive, articulating the ideas and questions of her narrators clearly and without judgment. I had been looking forward to her next novel ever since, and <em>Weather</em> had sat on the shelf since release in February, waiting for a day like this when I would be able to enjoy it in its entirety. I was happy to find it full of all the insight and poetry I expected. Take for example – and out of context – this simple couplet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quiet in the cup. Hard to believe that isn&rsquo;t joy, the way it flies away when I fling it out the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a novel of fragments: observation, meditation, worry, question – all strung together loosely about a simple narrative coloured with concerns about family, duty, and (as the title suggests) the larger, incomprehensible forces which shape daily life.</p>
<p>I highly recommend both novels, as well as the practice of enjoying them in a single sitting. I have not read Offill&rsquo;s debut (<em>Last Things</em> (2000)), but enjoying <em>Weather</em> so much this afternoon has moved it further up my list.</p>

Each team, from the seclusion of their homes, comes up with a set of ten questions on a topic of their choice, and turns are taken to read them out.

			 <p>Five years ago today I was the fittest I&rsquo;ve ever been. Actually, make that five years and one day ago, since today is the fifth anniversary of <a href="/marathon">my first (and only) marathon</a> – and that took something out of me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way on this green Earth that I&rsquo;ll be running another marathon anytime soon. I feel every one of the five years older, and I&rsquo;m probably a stone heavier than I was in the spring of 2015. But more dissuasive than either of those factors is the persistent knee problem I&rsquo;ve had for the last few years. I&rsquo;ve occasionally tested my right knee on short runs and always found it wasn&rsquo;t keen to take the repeated impacts of running even at a modest pace. It&rsquo;s a shame, and it feels like a loss, but I try and remain thankful that – to date at least – I&rsquo;m pain free when going about normal activities.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to do something to mark the occasion. So I filled every water bottle in the house, put on an audiobook (Donna Tartt reading her own <em>The Secret History</em>), and clipped into my exercise bike.</p>
<p>Five years ago it took me 5 hours and 8 minutes to run 26.2 miles; covering the same distance in the saddle this time took a little over 90 minutes. It also cost me 1,424 kcal, which I intend to offset with an extra rock bun this afternoon.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/04/12/a-feminist-critique.html">&#39;A Feminist Critique of Murakami&#39;</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was happy to see <a href="https://lithub.com/a-feminist-critique-of-murakami-novels-with-murakami-himself/">a piece like this</a> appear on Lit Hub; I had high hopes that it would address the one genuine problem I have with the work of Haruki Murakami – an author whom <a href="/witawitar">I admire a great deal</a>.</p>
<p>At first the interviewer (singer and author Mieko Kawakami) is admirably straightforward in tackling the issue head on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> I’m talking about the large number of female characters who exist solely to fulfill a sexual function. On the one hand, your work is boundlessly imaginative when it comes to plots, to wells, and to men, but the same can’t be said for their relationships with women. It’s not possible for these women to exist on their own. And while female protagonists, or even supporting characters, may enjoy a moderate degree of self-expression, thanks to their relative independence, there’s a persistent tendency for women to be sacrificed for the sake of the male leads. So the question is, why is it that women are so often called upon to play this role in Murakami novels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, unfortunately, when Murakami&rsquo;s answers are less than impressive, she doesn’t push him on the issues, instead willing to accept as answers evasions and weak excuses like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HM:</strong> I’m not a thinker, or a critic, or a social activist. I’m just a novelist.

			 <p>It’s the start of a new month, and around here that means it’s time to take care of a bunch of little tasks I schedule to keep my Mac in good shape. I appreciate this may not be of interest to many people, but I thought I’d share my process in case someone’s looking for tips.</p>
<h3 id="1-uninstall-unwanted-apps">1. Uninstall unwanted apps.</h3>
<p>This is a monthly prompt to go through my Applications folder and check there’s nothing there that I no longer use. For the actual uninstalling I use an app called <a href="https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac">CleanMyMac X</a>, which has an ‘Uninstaller’ function that makes sure to strip out all the support files and system-level junk that would otherwise be left behind if I just dragged an app icon to the Recycle Bin.</p>
<h3 id="2-de-duplicate">2. De-duplicate.</h3>
<p>For this I use an app called <a href="https://macpaw.com/gemini">Gemini 2</a>. The process couldn’t be simpler: open the app, select a drive (I just go for my Mac’s hard disk), and hit ‘Scan for Duplicates’. This just makes sure I’m not using up disk space with multiple copies of the same file, and also prompts me if I’ve somehow ended up duplicating an entire folder whilst working on it.</p>
<h3 id="3-audit-1password">3. Audit 1Password.</h3>
<p>If you don’t currently use a password manager, it’s easily the single-most impactful step you can take to protect your accounts. There are plenty out there these days; I’ve been a <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> user for many years, and I can’t fault it. The process here is simply to run down the ‘All items’ list, and make sure they all pertain to accounts I still use. Where I find something I don’t use anymore this is a good prompt to go and close the account and delete the saved credentials. 1Password will also notify me if a website I have an account with has been the subject of a data breach, or if a site offers two-factor authentication but I don’t have it set up. All useful stuff to make sure you’re as safe as possible.</p>
<h3 id="4-backup-ios-devices">4. Backup iOS devices.</h3>
<p>Whilst iOS – properly configured – is creating nightly backups to iCloud, there are some things those don’t contain. As a precautionary measure, I make a monthly snapshot of both my iPhone and my iPad by creating backups via Mac’s Finder utility. The upside here is that by adding a password you can choose to encrypt the local backup, allowing it to include sensitive material like health data and saved passwords – these things are not included in standard over-the-air backups to iCloud. (Bonus: there’s something nostalgia-inducing about connecting my iPhone to my Mac with an honest-to-goodness cable.)</p>
<h3 id="5-run-maintenance-scripts">5. Run maintenance scripts.</h3>
<p>Back to CleanMyMac X, this time to run the ‘Smart Scan’ function. This takes a system-wide look at my Mac, and makes recommendations about what could be done to improve the state of it: purging old system files, freeing up RAM, optimising the storage of Mail attachments etc… you don’t need to be technically proficient at any of it, the app will handle it all for you.</p>
<h3 id="6-backup-photos">6. Backup photos.</h3>
<p>This is the first thing most people think of when they worry about losing data to a fault with their computer. I use iCloud Photo Library, so there’s already a bit of redundancy built in since I have local copies of my photos and copies stored on iCloud. (In step 7 below you’ll see there’s actually a further two copies being made.) But, better safe than sorry, so I also keep an archive of photos on an external hard drive. This gets plugged in once a month and I simply copy the month’s photos across to save them in a simple year / month folder hierarchy.</p>
<h3 id="7-create-bootable-clone">7. Create bootable clone.</h3>
<p>This is the one you hope you’ll never need to use. Backups of iOS devices and photos are great, but if your whole computer implodes they’re not going to be much use. Creating backups of your whole system can be done fairly easily via macOS’s built-in Time Machine utility, or for extra peace of mind you could opt for off-site backup just in case your computer and external hard drives get stolen or destroyed at the same time. I go this second route, and use a service called <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a>, which copies any updated files on my computer on a continuous basis and keeps them in encrypted storage somewhere beneath the Nevada desert, or on the moon. <em>However</em> (unless something has changed that I haven’t caught) backups to Time Machine and / or Backblaze are not bootable. They’re great if you have a working computer and you want to roll back some changes, or find a lost file. But if <em>everything</em> fails and you need to start fresh, you’re going to need a bootable clone of your whole system. Enter <a href="https://bombich.com">Carbon Copy Cloner 5</a>. Again, this is an app that just does the whole thing for you: link up an external hard drive, and set it to work.</p>
<h3 id="8-physically-clean-mac">8. Physically clean Mac.</h3>
<p>I use a product called <a href="https://whoosh.com">Whoosh</a>, but there are plenty of alternatives out there. (Actually, during the pandemic era Apple has updated its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123">guidance on cleaning iOS devices</a> to allow for the use of certain household disinfectants.)</p>
<p>And that’s it. Done for another month. Alongside this I have a <em>weekly</em> regimen for keeping my iPhone in good shape, so if you’re really lucky I might share that here too at some point!</p>

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/03/31/doctors-sleep.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-03-30 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Mar 30, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the weekend I finished reading Stephen King’s 2013 novel <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, and then caught up with the film adaptation from 2019. Here are some (relatively spoiler free) thoughts in bullet form.</p>
<p><strong>It’s brave to return to material this well regarded.</strong> <em>The Shining</em> (1977) remains one of the top-tier novels of King’s long career, which makes <em>Doctor Sleep</em> a huge gamble. The stakes are far higher here than for any one of the (very few) other direct sequels he’s written, such as continuations of the Bill Hodges story, or <em>Black House</em> (2001, alongside Peter Straub).</p>
<p><strong>It’s a very different novel to its precursor.</strong> I haven’t looked too deep into it, but I gather the backlash to <em>Doctor Sleep</em> on publication was that it wasn’t <em>The Shining</em>. And it sure isn’t. King’s not interested in retreading old ground, and he flips the claustrophobia, the isolation, and even the power dynamics of his decades-old classic on their heads for the sequel. There are familiar thematic elements – such as addiction as metaphor for possession – but those too are inverted: Danny isn’t his father, and the novel’s villains have as much to lose as its protagonists do.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t ride two horses at the same time.</strong> I don’t envy Mike Flanagan the task of adapting this book for film. Readers of <em>The Shining</em> who have also seen Kubrick’s 1980 film will know that there are significant plot differences; in particular the two versions have very different endings. Flanagan takes on the task of both bringing the new book to screen, and producing a sequel to Kubrick’s film – and you simply can’t do both. He sure tries, but the last act of the movie indulges in exactly the sort of heavy-handed nostalgia that King avoids in the novel. Flanagan is aware that a majority of his audience will know the cinematic version of <em>The Shining</em> better than they know the source work, and he plays to it with mixed results.</p>
<p><strong>The medium shapes the story in interesting ways.</strong> As a huge fan of Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> (another 2013 novel), I had high hopes for what turned out to be a serviceable but uninspired film adaptation of that book. Watching the movie version was a lesson in all the many things that can be done on the page that just can’t be translated to film. I found the same thing at play with <em>Doctor Sleep</em>. At 150+ minutes it’s not short, and yet it’s far <em>too</em> short to get to know its cast of characters anything like as well as one does when reading the novel. I suppose that’s par for the course; a book will always be better than the film of it, at least in most respects. I was struck in particular by one effect that the streamlining for screen had on the story here. The result is a work that’s strangely cruel to some of its characters: there are no fewer than three protagonists that make it the end of the novel just fine, but who meet (sometimes gruesome) ends on screen. These are characters who certainly don’t need to die, except that it would complicate the film to have them hanging around.</p>
<p><strong>King’s ending is better.</strong> As might be clear by now, I much preferred the novel to the film. (The latter isn’t bad, and I can see myself watching and enjoying it again in a few years’ time; perhaps when the novel is less fresh to me, I’ll be able to come to Flanagan’s movie on its own terms.) But the starkest contrast of all, as with the two versions of <em>The Shining</em>, is between the two endings. As noted above, Flanagan’s seems needlessly cruel, where King allows his characters more grace. Strangely, and perhaps purposefully, there’s a way to read the ending of <em>Doctor Sleep</em> the film as an attempt to restore the ending of <em>The Shining</em> the novel. To my mind, at least at the moment, it doesn’t work as well as King’s more hopeful ending, and particularly his perfectly pitched final chapter.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-caterina-barbieri--ecstatic-computation">20. Caterina Barbieri — <em>Ecstatic Computation</em></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://caterinabarbieri.com">her (neo-GeoCities) website</a>, Barbieri ‘explores the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations in music, by investigating the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers to draw severe, complex geometries in time and space’. That’s a better explanation than I can offer as to how her music operates. Often sparse it still has the ability to surprise through the unexpected ways in which the rhythms play around and off each other. The 10-plus minutes of opener ‘Fantas’ is a sonic world all its own; dark echoes give birth to bright synths, which in turn make way for mellower, fuzzier tones. It’s a headphone album right down to its sonic DNA, and when I made time to listen to it that way I enjoyed it enormously.</p>
<h3 id="19-chai--punk">19. CHAI — <em>Punk</em></h3>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Nisennenmondai infiltrated the ranks of Go! Team, I have your answer. CHAI is an all-female Japanese pop-rock ensemble who make one heck of a racket. I have very little idea what’s going on in most of these tracks – the lyrics are a mix of Japanese and heavily-accented English – but it never matters. Killer bass lines conspire with super-catchy synths and a combination of live and programmed drums to make the kind of 32 minute record that leaves you desperate to find out what this all looks and sounds like live. It’s dayglo bright and not at all nuanced, and the weirdness of understanding only every fifth lyric never really goes away, but joy and enthusiasm just radiates from it in waves. And in 2019, there’s nothing more punk than that.</p>
<h3 id="18-thom-yorke--anima">18. Thom Yorke — <em>ANIMA</em></h3>
<p>Perhaps it’s misleading, but increasingly it feels possible to discern what each member of Radiohead brings to their collaborative project by examining their solo output. Ed O’Brien’s recent single ‘Brasil’ starts out folksy and grounded, before being lifted (by Colin Greenwood’s bass no less) into a different place: somewhere looser, groovier, and more danceable. Jony Greenwood’s film scores have given a glimpse of the expanse and complexity of his musical thinking. And Thom Yorke keeps making weird, dark electronica records.</p>
<p><em>ANIMA</em> feels even more insular to me than previous releases, trapped in its own head, or else providing a release for someone who otherwise would be. It’s still seductive, and beautifully crafted, but despite knowing I was holding its composer to a higher standard, I couldn’t help but note the lack of an ‘Analyse’, ‘Harrowdown Hill’, or ‘A Brain in a Bottle’ here.</p>
<h3 id="17-charly-bliss--young-enough">17. Charly Bliss — <em>Young Enough</em></h3>
<p>You might remember Charly Bliss’s debut (<em>Guppy</em>) from my 2017 list, or the highlight of the album, ‘Ruby’, as one of my songs of that year. Their follow up is more of the same: bubblegum-adjacent melodies and an arch vocal delivery of largely diaristic lyrics. It’s fun stuff, and catchy in a lot of the right places. The playing has tightened up a little bit, and it feels as though a decision has been taken to polish the production a bit more than previously. There are still loose ends and plenty of energy, but it doesn’t feel as raw as before. Even so, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of a second helping of Charly Bliss. One listen through opener ‘Blown to Bits’ will tell you whether it might also be your thing. (PS. That track opens with a synth chord so close to the one that opens Weezer’s 1996 b-side ‘I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams’ that I refuse to believe it’s coincidence.)</p>
<h3 id="16-anderson-paak--ventura">16. Anderson .Paak — <em>Ventura</em></h3>
<p>Anderson .Paak is an artist I’ve struggled to get a handle on. But, after dipping into 2016’s <em>Yes Lawd!</em>, and (unwittingly) skipping 2018’s <em>Oxnard</em>, I immediately vibed with the latter’s sister album: <em>Ventura</em>.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Come Home’ is like an extended title sequence, featuring some gold standard Andre 3000 bars. Then it’s on to the soulful relationship therapy of ‘Make it Better’, pairing Anderson’s rich vocals with those of none other than Smokey Robinson. From there its warm, honey-toned production, smart lyrics, and laid back beats all the way, through lead single ‘King James’ all the way until ‘What Can We Do?’ closes the record with the best Nate Dogg feature since ’21 Questions’ (2002).</p>
<h3 id="15-beirut--gallipoli">15. Beirut — <em>Gallipoli</em></h3>
<p>Beirut is one of those bands that have long been on the periphery of my awareness, and which I knew I should be paying more attention to. Now, as with Spoon’s <em>They Want My Soul</em> (2014) and Low’s <em>Double Negative</em> (2018), a record has finally captured my full attention. Gallipoli is manifestly the work of creators very comfortable in their artistic skins. Lyrically and tonally melancholy, but musically expansive and exploratory, there’s a warmth at its heart that never dims even in its darker moments. Album high point ‘Gauze für Zah’ is an exemplar of the record’s broad sonic palate, Zach Condon’s drifting, melodic vocal, and the manner in which Beirut are often content to let compositions develop at an unforced pace rather than force a strict structure.</p>
<p>This won’t be for everyone, but it was a record unlike many others I heard this year, and I was grateful to it for bringing Beirut more squarely into focus for me.</p>
<h3 id="14-james-blake--assume-form">14. James Blake — <em>Assume Form</em></h3>
<p>This album came along so early in the year (18 Jan) that I wasn’t sure it would stick around for me, but I’ve played it fairly regularly all year. I know a lot of people call out Blake’s voice as a highlight of his work; I find it very effective (particularly in its higher register), but I would also take an album full of his giddy, kaleidoscopic sonic compositions without the vocals. In fact, the better vocal performances on this record belong to Travis Scott on album highlight ‘Mile High’, and ROSALÍA on the haunting, off-kilter ‘Barefoot in the Park’.</p>
<p>The tempo remains staid throughout, but there’s a range of modes here, between which Blake switches without missing a beat. I find him to be an intriguing musician, and one I can’t quite place comfortably. Somewhere on an archipelago off the coast of electronica, he’s just doing his own thing.</p>
<h3 id="13-foals--part-1-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost">13. Foals — <em>Part 1 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost</em></h3>
<p>I had Foals’ debut, <em>Antidotes</em>, on release in 2008 and I was ready to file them away with other art-math-rock bands like Klaxons, whose debut (<em>Myths of the Near Future</em>) I had admired but not loved the year before. It’s been a welcome surprise to watch Foals grow, and their sonic palate complicate and evolve to something that I can only describe as Biffy Clyro covering The Mars Volta. <em>What Went Down</em> (2015) very nearly made my top 20 of that year, largely on the strength of its unassailably huge title track, and now we’re here.</p>
<p>Double albums are always enormously ambitious projects, and by virtue of the two halves having been released separately I have to consider them individually. You won’t find Part 2 of <em>ENSWBL</em> on this list: its late-October release date hasn’t allowed me time to digest it enough. Part 1 has remained on heavy rotation since March, however, and despite that I feel like there’s still plenty more in there for me to discover.</p>
<h3 id="12-tyler-the-creator--igor">12. Tyler, The Creator — <em>IGOR</em></h3>
<p>I’m not sure where to start with this record. The palate is hip-hop infused with jazz touches, soul, gospel, and funk. The record opens with an extended synth tone that keys you to the texture of what follows, but what follows is a shifting thing. First track proper, ‘EARFQUAKE’ was originally written for (but rejected by) Justin Bieber, so Tyler has turned it into a downbeat pean that has shrugged itself free of anything like traditional song structure. And once you’re on the ride, you have little choice but to strap in and enjoy it; this is an album in the proper sense of the word - obviously intended to be experienced as a whole. A moody melange of twilight production, treated vocals that see Tyler pushing his singing voice as much as he raps, songs that ‘end’ and then continue… twice.</p>
<p>Above all else it’s the sheer inventiveness of the song structures, and the compelling production that kept me coming back. I didn’t hear a finer hip-hop record this year.</p>
<h3 id="11-wand--laughing-matter">11. Wand — <em>Laughing Matter</em></h3>
<p>I’ve long wondered, sometimes aloud, why no one else makes music that sounds anything like Radiohead. My first impression upon hearing <em>Laughing Matter</em> was that Wand are also at least at the same dance, even if they’re moving a bit differently to the Oxford quintet.</p>
<p>Cory Hanson’s soft, tuneful vocals; Lee Landey’s inquisitive bass lines; Evan Burrows’s restless, inventive percussion… it all adds up to something very impressive. Add in Robert Cody’s brilliantly judged guitar - always happy to play a supporting role that makes each track better - and Sofie Arreguin’s synths adding colour and sonic texture, and you have an album that blooms into something genuinely special.</p>
<p>Aside from the, admittedly terrible, none-more-psych-rock album cover, the only disappointment is that the track ‘High Planes Drifter’ isn’t a cover of the 1989 Beastie Boys cut.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-regrettes--how-do-you-love">10. The Regrettes — <em>How Do You Love?</em></h3>
<p>I just looked back at my list from 2017 and apparently The Regrettes’ debut (<em>Feel Your Feelings Fool</em>) didn’t make the final cut. That surprised me, because in retrospect it’s one of the albums from that year that has had the most staying power for me. And now I have this excellent follow-up to file right alongside it.</p>
<p>At heart the record is nothing more complicated than a set of relationship songs (from love songs, to break up songs and everything in between), all laid out in frontwoman Lydia Night’s smoky, bluesy vocal, underpinned by soulful bass lines and bright percussion. With the sound having evolved a hair away from the debut’s punk notes the guitar is a little bit pop and a little bit classic 50s rock n’ roll. I fully expect to be playing album highlights ‘California Friends’, ‘ I Dare You’ and ‘Pumpkin’ for years to come.</p>
<h3 id="9-floating-points-crush">9. Floating Points — <em>Crush</em></h3>
<p>My only other touchstone for the term ‘floating points’ is a measurement of computing power: FLOPS, or floating point operations per second. And to me it feels as though there’s something apt about the name chosen by neuroscientist &amp; epigeneticist Sam Shepherd for his musical project. Intricate, busy beats vie with dense, shifting loops for the listener’s attention; the listening experience is akin to visiting a gallery of impressionist visual art - sometimes bewildering, at points confrontational, but constantly intriguing and compelling.</p>
<p>There are more easygoing moments, such as ‘Anasickmodular’ with its house beat buried deep in the mix under layers of shifting sonic sands. And there are danceable moments like ‘LesAlpx’ with its room-sized bass. It’s a record that ends up feeling far more than the sum of its parts, and one I’ll likely sit down with again and again when I have a good pair of headphones to hand.</p>
<h3 id="8-fennesz--agora">8. Fennesz — <em>Agora</em></h3>
<p>It was an odd year for me and electronic / ambient music. I heard a lot of stuff I liked, but nothing quite hit me in the way LPs by Nicolas Jaar, Takeleave, Shigeto, Loscil, and Submerse etc. have in years past. Agora is the highest placing such album on this year’s list, and the closest thing I encountered to an experience like some of those listed above.</p>
<p>Agora is actually more toward the ambient end of the spectrum. Really what you’re getting here is a quartet of what I’ve spoken of in the past as aural landscapes. This kind of sonic topography has only grown in appeal for me over the years, and Fennesz is working in the same mould as Ryuichi Sakamoto and William Basinski. When I took the time to spend with it properly, I loved it. At other times it acted as slightly odd background music to several meals.</p>
<p>My end of year Music Replay lists Four Tet amongst my most played artists of 2019, and his studio output this year was a pair of singles. Which is to say that, unable to find truly stellar new electronica, I fell back on old favourites. Fennesz, at least, gave me something new and substantial to immerse myself in.</p>
<h3 id="7-vampire-weekend--father-of-the-bride">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Father of the Bride</em></h3>
<p>Without necessarily knowing it, I’ve been waiting for this record for six years. I don’t have a copy of my lists as far back as Vampire Weekend’s eponymous 2008 debut, but I’m guessing it placed high. That album – featuring the perennial modern classics ‘A-Punk’, ‘Oxford Comma’ et al – was the most effortlessly cool arrival on the musical stage since The Strokes’ in 2001. Two years later, <em>Contra</em> took that model and gave it a twist on tracks like the almost-too-jaunty ‘Holiday’ and the almost-too-manic ‘Cousins’. When that record placed seventh on my 2010 list I noted how pleasant a surprise it was that the band had managed to recapture the magic of their debut and replicate its infectious energy.</p>
<p>And then <em>Modern Vampires of the City</em> (2013) threw me for a loop. A little darker, quite a bit stranger, more… mature, if that’s the right word. Vampire Weekend had shifted gears on me, and despite the fact that the album still features perhaps my favourite of the band’s songs (‘Diane Young’), I wasn’t sure how to make the transition. In a weird way, <em>Father of the Bride</em> has returned me to its precursor with new admiration. What the band began six years ago they deliver in spades on this year’s record.</p>
<p>Lead single ‘This Life’ is the sort of song that sounds like it always existed, just waiting for someone to intone the magic words to bring it into being. Ezra Koenig’s always smart lyricism does the trick, and we receive another gem of a pop song as a result.</p>
<p>But Vampire Weekend are reaching for more here. It’s a smart decision to pair Koenig’s (still immediately recognisable) voice with a female guest, and Danielle Haim proves a perfect partner. It’s just one of several signs that the band feel assured enough at this stage to relax away from 3-minute pop-rock jewels, and explore other avenues. At 18 tracks and an hour of running time, <em>Father of the Bride</em> gives them plenty of room to do so, and they don’t waste a moment of it.</p>
<h3 id="6-toro-y-moi--outer-peace">6. Toro y Moi — <em>Outer Peace</em></h3>
<p>Third time on the list in a row for Chaz Bear’s one man hazy vibe machine. In 2015 <em>What For?</em> made 4th, and two years later / ago <em>Boo Boo</em> sat at 13th. In all honesty, there’s not too much to tell the albums apart; if there are musical evolutions here they’re minimal. I for one am quite happy, however, to have one of these records every couple of years – laid back beats, warm, fuzzy production, and Bear’s easygoing vocal delivery remain a tonic.</p>
<p>‘Ordinary Pleasure’ is an effortlessly catchy celebration of art and life in general (and the video’s fun); ‘Who I Am’ is a danceable minimal gem; and ‘Miss Me’ is all space and mood. But the album’s high point for me remains ‘Freelance’, with it’s weird Animal Collective-inspired vocal tic, and typical TyM lyrics mixing the prosaic &amp; profound:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals<br>
I can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old<br>
I can’t hear you, maybe you could change your tone<br>
People tend to listen when they see your soul</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="5-jimmy-eat-world--surviving">5. Jimmy Eat World — <em>Surviving</em></h3>
<p>OK, here’s the formula: first you make sure you have one of the year’s best album covers, then you sequence the album so that you start with a statement-of-intent title track, then you start that track with one of the most Jimmy Eat World guitar riffs imaginable. That’s how you kick off a rock record that will get my attention in 2019, and it’s also how you make your return to this list after more than a decade. Don’t get me wrong, 2016’s <em>Integrity Blues</em> wasn’t a bad record, and there were things to like on <em>Invented</em> (2010) (I barely remember <em>Damage</em> (2013) however; I’m not 100% sure that album exists). But it’s been a long time since Jimmy Eat World made a record that felt genuinely great, and the excellent news is that <em>Surviving</em> is as good an album as they’ve ever made. I still play <em>Clarity</em> (1999) &amp; <em>Bleed American</em> (2001) a fair bit, and I can see myself adding this LP to that rotation.</p>
<p>Take, as just one example, ‘All the Way (Stay)’ - the kind of heartfelt, keenly urgent rock song this band are uniquely capable of writing on their best days. This is a record that suggests those are not all behind them.</p>
<h3 id="4-sigrid--sucker-punch">4. Sigrid — <em>Sucker Punch</em></h3>
<p>Last year Robyn dropped an album called <em>Honey</em> that didn’t make my list, but has grown on me quite a bit since. I mention that here because on <em>Sucker Punch</em> Sigrid is working side by side with her Scandinavian sister in the dance-infused electro-pop mines, and boy is she digging out some jewels.</p>
<p>The album’s title track is a crystal clear, simple slice of joy. ‘Mine Right Now’ feigns innocence for its first 30 seconds and then hits you right in whatever part of your brain responds to synth-driven anthems. And those are just the first two of a dozen near-flawless, glittering pop gems. There are tracks like ‘Don’t Kill My Vibe’ and ‘Level Up’ that are unafraid to dive into more personal, emotional lyricism, but I dare you not to sing along after you’ve heard them a couple of times.</p>
<p>There are no tricks here, just an assured, lilting vocal style and a cache of catchy tunes produced as simply as you like. That will get you in the top five only if you bring the songwriting goods, and Sigrid’s basket is full. More please.</p>
<h3 id="3-madison-cunningham--who-are-you-now">3. Madison Cunningham — <em>Who Are You Now</em></h3>
<p>This was an album that captured me right from the first listen: simple arrangements — rooted in country / folk / bluegrass — and a voice that sounds like clear running water. I was reminded of the stark beauty of Laura Marling’s debut, with a shade of something sharper, à la Jenny Lewis (see eg. the development of ‘Song in My Head’ for a good example of the mix).</p>
<p>There’s a lightness and a freshness to the album that belies some of its lyrical weight, with Cunningham’s voice effortlessly somersaulting over (deceptively complex) acoustic guitar. ‘Something To Believe In’ features an expressive piano arrangement as an exception to prove the rule. This lightness of touch mixed with often stark emotion has secured the record a Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Americana Album’, which feels richly deserved even if I’m not sure of the category definition.</p>
<p>Released in summer, this has really come into its own for me as the days got colder and the evenings longer.</p>
<h3 id="2-jade-bird--jade-bird">2. Jade Bird — <em>Jade Bird</em></h3>
<p>First you have to get over the voice: it sounds like it’s that of a seasoned folk-rock trooper who has been on the road since the 70s with a pack of Marlboros tucked in her sleeve, but it actually belongs to a 22 year old from Northumberland.</p>
<p>Once you’re past that you can enjoy some of the most enjoyable, well crafted voice-and-a-guitar songs I’ve heard in quite some time. Like a louder, brasher Laura Marling who sounds like she might have a knife in her boot, Bird lays out beautiful, impassioned stories of love and loss one after another as though it’s easy to do. The voice <em>or</em> the songwriting would likely place this record on this List, but the combination has it at number two because it’s nothing short of magical.</p>
<p>Sliding up four notes in the final moments of ‘Side Effects’, shifting from fragile to indomitable on ‘My Motto’, or somehow conveying both regret and strength in the same line: “Are you sure you wanna do this now?” (‘Ruins’). There’s also a key change on that last song (in fact the album’s opener) which just about kills me every time. And those are just the first examples that come to mind.</p>
<p>‘Uh Huh’ &amp; ‘Good at It’ are a kind of one-two punch of an update to Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, and in fact the comparison feels apt. This is top tier songwriting and one of the most compelling deliveries I’ve heard in some time.</p>
<h3 id="1-taylor-swift--lover">1. Taylor Swift — <em>Lover</em></h3>
<p>It seems to me that each of the past few years when putting together this list I’ve mounted a case for one straight-ahead pop record or another. (Tove Styrke’s <em>Sway</em> (#13 last year) being the most recent example.) It felt inevitable that at some point one of those records was going to plant its flag this deep in my heart. Top spot this year goes to the record I played more than any other, by the artist I played more than any other.
According to Music I’ve listened to 1,155 hours’ of music this year. That’s 143 different artists, and 186 different releases. And yet seven out of my top ten most listened-to tracks, including the entire top five, come from one record. And I’m not nearly done playing any of them. In reverse order then:</p>
<p>• ‘I Forgot that You Existed’: the album opener is the sound of someone reclaiming their power with as assured a light touch as you can imagine. A sparse musical bed over which Swift’s voice floats, saying goodbye to something she doesn’t need anymore.</p>
<p>• ‘The Man’: an upbeat synth-pop masterpiece by way of feminist anthem, and like every song here entirely impossible not to sing along to every time you hear it.</p>
<p>• ‘The Archer’: a downbeat synth-pop masterpiece showcasing Swift at her most emotionally vulnerable as it builds to something more powerful.</p>
<p>• ‘You Need to Calm Down’: instantly ranks alongside my favourite pop tracks of all time. The five layered “uh ohs” of the bridge have pretty much been stuck in my head all year. A beautiful, righteous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>• ‘Lover’: my most-listened to song of 2019 is an exquisite, tender ballad about holding close that which you love.</p>
<p>And then there’s ‘Paper Rings’, ‘ME!’, ‘I Think He Knows’….</p>
<p>It’s kind of fitting that it’s Swift who takes this giant leap for pop music kind and claims top spot on my List. I’ve been increasingly impressed with her as a cultural figure since she handled the whole Kanye West / VMAs debacle with such grace. It was Swift’s protest that single-handedly got Apple to agree to pay artists when their music was listened to during the free trial period of the Music streaming service. And most recently she has been both an increasingly vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and an increasingly visible opponent of industry practices that place record companies entirely in control of artists’ work.</p>
<p>So, alongside becoming the most decorated performer in the history of the American Music Awards, and being heralded their ‘Artist of the Decade’, here’s another trophy for Taylor’s shelf: she made my favourite album of 2019.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-jaguwar--ringthing">20. JAGUWAR — <em>Ringthing</em></h3>
<p>Sometimes you need some shoegaze. Or, rather, sometimes I just need a sound I can hide my head inside like a great cloud of candyfloss. The peddles are less aggressively tuned, and the layering of tracks frequently too sparse for this to be considered <em>true</em> shoegaze, but JAGUWAR have put my bloody valentine and Battles in a blender, with a dash of The Cure, and poured something out. Sometimes it sounds amiably mournful (‘Crystal’), sometimes it’s mournfully amiable (‘Away’). In either case, I’ve been happy to spend quite a bit of time with headphones on letting this rain down on me.</p>
<h3 id="19-john-tejada--dead-start-program">19. John Tejada — <em>Dead Start Program</em></h3>
<p>Headphone electronica from a journeyman of the genre. This is a record that is uneven in terms of its moods, but unflagging in terms of quality. Tempos and timbres alter from track to track – frenetic and impatient on ‘All at Sea’, upbeat and celebratory on ‘Heal’ – but throughout there’s an attention to detail, and a well-honed sense of experimentation that keeps the listener guessing and the rhythms interesting. Album highlight for me since first listen has been the joyously off-kilter ‘Detector’, which seems to dare you to connect either with its cheeky melody or its grimy bass, and then try to marry the two in your mind.</p>
<h3 id="18-snail-mail--lush">18. Snail Mail — <em>Lush</em></h3>
<p>I closed last year’s list with a note on my amazement that Jay Som’s <em>Everybody Works</em> had emerged from one woman’s bedroom a finished and singular project. I’d like to reiterate those sentiments here with respect to <em>Lush</em> – I don’t understand how a 19 year old can listen (in all likelihood) to a whole bunch of Sonic Youth and Elliot Smith records, and then produce something this heartfelt and eloquent. Even though, in this instance, she’s playing with a band rather than multi-instrumenting it, the question remains: how does one find one’s artistic voice with such clarity? In particular there are some really nice lyrical moments here that elevate simple but effective song structures to something very memorable.</p>
<h3 id="17-this-will-destroy-you--new-others-part-one--two">17. This Will Destroy You — <em>New Others Part One / Two</em></h3>
<p>I’ve been awaiting a new TWDY release since I discovered their self-titled album a few years ago in a lull between Explosions in the Sky LPs. And that’s what’s on offer here. Given to slightly less bombast than their fellow Texans, but painting with similar colours in a similar style, this is wide open music with a big heart and dreams as big as its regrets.</p>
<p>Two albums by the same band, which share a title, but were released weeks apart. So… you’re not going to let me have both, are you? In which case I choose the slightly more familiar, warm embrace of <em>New Others Part One</em> over the marginally more experimental, slightly rougher-around-the-edges, <em>…Part Two</em>. If only they’d released this as a double album though!</p>
<h3 id="16-black-belt-eagle-scout--mother-of-my-children">16. Black Belt Eagle Scout — <em>Mother of My Children</em></h3>
<p>The DNA of this record sounds more complicated to me with each passing listen. What I thought, at first, was a relatively straightforward collection of heartfelt, understated indie-folk started to express different parts of itself the more I replayed the album. There’s some Hole in there somewhere, and some influences or at least similarities with other acts on Saddle Creek. The guitars are by turns strummed or else distorted and contorted. The drums sometimes think they’d like to be on a different album. The vocals are perhaps the most consistent element of the record’s shifting composition, but they’re used to convey lyrics that first burn then soothe; that are twisted with grief, and then adamant with resilience.</p>
<p>All of this starts to make more sense when you learn that the woman behind the record – it’s a solo project by Katherine Paul – identifies as a radical indigenous queer feminist. This is an album that is grown from the soil of both personal losses, and the protests at Standing Rock. It strives to capture something both intimate and universal about loss and change. And from the fuzzed up opener ‘Soft Stud’ to the sad, slight closer ‘Sam, A Dream’, it succeeds again and again.</p>
<h3 id="15-oh-pep--i-wasnt-only-thinking-about-you">15. Oh Pep! — <em>I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You…</em></h3>
<p>Listening to this record calls up for me a history of enjoying the output of Laura Veirs, Azure Ray, Jenny Lewis et al. It’s a lightly whipped mix of indie guitar and personal vocals with the kind of modest scale that means I would rather see them perform at Camden Lock than Brixton Academy. There’s a cute PR backstory about how the two members met by accident and formed a band out of necessity, but the important part is that their twin vocals work superbly well together. The instrumentation is relatively slight, and everything is handled with a deft lightness of touch, counterpointing the sometimes downbeat lyrics. This isn’t a record that demands much of the listener, but provides excellent company whether used as walking-around music, or bright afternoon stereo listening.</p>
<h3 id="14-screaming-females--all-at-once">14. Screaming Females — <em>All At Once</em></h3>
<p>The bedrock of Screaming Females’ sound is a combination of moderately treated guitar, fuzzed-up bass, and largely simple-but-effective drums. Theirs is a sound that, if encountered on the radio, would these days leave you guessing which of the last three decades it had come from. The key is doing it well, and this record is proof enough that the formula still works. The band’s marquee attraction comes in the form of Marissa Paternoster’s vocals. There’s a little Kim Deal here, and a dash of Laura Jane Grace: as driving as the guitars, as rough edged as the bass, and as straight-to-business as the drums. The record’s signature attraction for me is her ability to wind the vocal melodies around her own impressive guitar lines.</p>
<h3 id="13-tove-styrke--sway">13. Tove Styrke — <em>Sway</em></h3>
<p>Pop music! Who doesn’t love (some of) it? Over the years I’ve learned to accept that when a song or album or artist just <em>works</em> for me, I shouldn’t question it, just enjoy it. So, here’s the third album by a Swedish electropop artist I’ve never heard of before.</p>
<p>‘Mistakes’ is a brain limpet of a potency only equalled by a few songs this year; one of them is titled ‘Sway’ and it opens this album with an impossible-to-follow dopamine pop of pure, fleeting pleasure.</p>
<p>Will I still be listening to this album in a couple of years? Unlikely. Did it offer me a lot of unfiltered joy this year? Yes, yes it did.</p>
<p>(For the record, my favourite pop song of the year was probably Ariana Grande’s ‘the light is coming’.)</p>
<h3 id="12-young-fathers--cocoa-sugar">12. Young Fathers — <em>Cocoa Sugar</em></h3>
<p>Like most, I first encountered Young Fathers when they won the Mercury in 2014. I’m remiss in not doing my due diligence in the years since, only catching up with their second LP (<em>White Men are Black Men Too</em> (2015)) late. But I was there for the release of <em>Cocoa Sugar</em>, which immediately won a place on this list with its mercurial strangeness. Like a more introverted TV On The Radio, this is a group that seems to make its music by taking a melody or a bass line or a lyric, and twisting it until it deforms into something else.</p>
<p>‘In My View’ is the album highlight, doing something with syncopation and muted vocals that I haven’t heard used as effectively since Woodkid’s ‘Iron’ (2011). But there’s plenty to love and explore here, whether it’s the dark thicket of ‘Wow’ or the upside-down anthem ‘Picking You’ that closes the record. Come for the eye-catching album cover, stay for… whatever is happening sonically here. You’ll get something from it, even if it’s difficult to predict what, exactly.</p>
<h3 id="11-say-sue-me--where-we-were-together">11. Say Sue Me — <em>Where We Were Together</em></h3>
<p>If a Korean band release a pop record, is it K-pop? Actually, this couldn’t be further from the hyper-stylised output that’s increasingly making its presence felt in western charts. This is as good a collection of understated pop-verging-into-rock songs as any I heard this year. It’s warm and enthusiastic, and cribs from a whole range of western pop influences going back as far as maybe the Beach Boys. The production also has a glow to it that I really like, making it sound at times like elements were recorded in a large room, whilst the vocals remain up close and personal - sometimes barely above a whisper. The effortless, propulsive ’Old Town’ and ‘I Just Wanna Dance’ are where the record really shines, but epic closer ‘Coming to the End’ also deserves a shout out for hinting at ambition the rest of the album hadn’t showcased.</p>
<h3 id="10-gogo-penguin--a-humdrum-star">10. GoGo Penguin — <em>A Humdrum Star</em></h3>
<p>I cheated a bit when searching for a way to describe GoGo Penguin (who are new to me this year despite several records and a Mercury nomination in their past). Here’s a quote pulled from their official site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their music has been described as acoustic-electronica but they draw equally on rock, jazz and minimalism, game soundtracks and glitchy-electronica…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure that enables you to guess precisely what this record sounds like (if you haven’t heard it). For me the closest touchstone is perhaps Portico Quartet in their original incarnation, before they discovered synths. ‘Transient State’ almost runs away with itself, but deceptively complex jazz drumming keeps the piano just about in check. ‘Reactor’ rides its funky bass line down a series of tilting corridors, and ends up somewhere interesting. Sub 3-minute tracks sit alongside 8-minute plus odysseys, as this group of fine musicians seem to just enjoy exploring where they can take their sound.</p>
<h3 id="9-dott--heart-swell">9. DOTT — <em>Heart Swell</em></h3>
<p>There’s nothing new or particularly inventive about this record. I haven’t gone back through the band’s catalogue, but I’m guessing they have been doing more or less exactly this for a while. Power-chord pop, lightly treated vocals, bouncy bass lines, sometimes over-enthusiastic drum fills. They’re simple proof that these particular mines still have some gems left in them to find.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Bleached Blonde’ is a clarion call for enthusiasm, requesting that the listener throw caution to the wind and their arms to the sky. ’Like A Girl’ is a feminist anthem in the making (with a fun video to match). The stand out, for me, is the almost-too-simple ‘How Do I Feel?’: under 2 minutes of pop perfection that could have been released any year since the mid 50s, but still fresh sounding after it has been playing in my head all day.</p>
<h3 id="8-middle-kids--lost-friends">8. Middle Kids — <em>Lost Friends</em></h3>
<p>Every year I have at least one record full of three minute pop songs. This year it comes from an Australian trio, and it’s a little more emotionally diverse than perhaps is usual. ‘On My Knees’ is raucous and built for festival crowds, ‘Hole’ is plaintive, ‘Please’ is anthemic and optimistic, and ‘Mistake’ just might be my favourite song of the whole year (it’s certainly among the most infectious).</p>
<p>Hannah Joy’s vocals are characterised by a strength shot through with wavering vulnerability, and it feels as though the rest of the band’s sound has been modelled around it. This is a sweet record, but one with bruises. Its heart is on its sleeve, and it wants to link arms with you and sing together.</p>
<h3 id="7-shinya-fukumori-trio--for-2-akis">7. Shinya Fukumori Trio — <em>For 2 Akis</em></h3>
<p>You might be expecting by now that each of my lists comes with a token jazz record. I listened to less of the genre than I would have liked this year, with only a handful of releases really breaking through. The most notable amongst them, and the one I played more than any other by some margin, was this debut offering by the Japanese drummer’s newly-formed ensemble. Subtle, creative percussion; sweet, explorative tenor saxophone; contemplative piano. I could listen to this sound all day, preferably on headphones so as to get the most out of the record’s production, which allows each instrument a lot of space and the listener room enough to wander between them.</p>
<h3 id="6-low--double-negative">6. Low — <em>Double Negative</em></h3>
<p>Low are a band that sit squarely within my pile of shame. Formed in 1993, and with no fewer than eleven albums preceding this one, I’ve paid criminally little attention to them if this record is anything to judge by. My guess however (and it is just a guess, since I haven’t done the legwork), is that they weren’t making music that sounded like this in the mid-90s. I could be wrong, but in particular the use of decayed samples here seems very much of the moment.</p>
<p>I love everything about this record, starting with the art direction, and on through its warm production, its subtle instrumentation, and the dreamy texture of the vocals. (This is also my headphone album of the year!) I feel like there’s at least one record every year that I say this about, but every moment of <em>Double Negative</em> speaks to a band at full command of their powers, masterfully employing every tool at their disposal to get the sound in their heads onto tape. On every listen through, 49 minutes flies by and I’m left wanting to re-experience the whole thing.</p>
<h3 id="5-beacon--gravity-pairs">5. Beacon — <em>Gravity Pairs</em></h3>
<p>Here’s a case of first-listen certainty. In fact, arguably, this was a near lock for the list after I had heard only the leading single ‘Be My Organ’, which remains among my favourite tracks of the year.</p>
<p>This is an electronica of smooth, reflective surfaces, that also makes use of acoustic instrumentation (notably piano) to augment it. Layered on top are subtle vocals that are almost played like an additional instrument rather than being the focal point of any of the tracks. It’s melancholy stuff in places (eg. ‘Bending Light’), but many of the melodies are quite beautiful. The group’s most valuable talent seems to be a sense of exactly when to modulate emotions either within individual tracks, or over the album as a whole. As a result <em>Gravity Pairs</em> fits together like a polished crystal - smooth to the touch, but full of fragments and distortions.</p>
<h3 id="4-elohim--elohim">4. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>
<p>Here’s a slightly confusing situation. You may recall that the number 3 spot on 2016’s list was held by Elohim’s self-titled debut album. At the time she was very much talking about it as her first album, but at some point since has decided it was a 10-track EP. To make matters worse, this year she released what she now considers her debut LP… and gave it the same title.</p>
<p>Forget all of that. It makes no difference to the fact that ‘I Want You’ is light and breezy electronic pop of the highest order, ‘F**k Your Money’ is understated and darkly sly, and ‘Panic Attacks’ is an exquisite club anthem with the volume turned waaaaay down.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, Elohim can make whatever she wants and title it whatever she likes. After these two releases, I’ll be there to find out how it gets weirder.</p>
<p>(PS. I <em>really</em> wanted to put this at number 3, just for the symmetry, but…)</p>
<h3 id="3-takeleave--inner-sea">3. Takeleave — <em>Inner Sea</em></h3>
<p>In a year without an album release from my soul’s resident musician Submerse, to whom am I to turn for premium grade liminal electronica™? This is literally the thought process that found me listening to everything Berlin label Project Mooncircle put out this year. And among a veritable bevy of delights I was relieved and overjoyed to find this from Takeleave. It shifts, it glows, it washes over you in waves timed to your slowing heartbeat. Call it downtempo house, or ambient techno, or broken beats… I don’t mind. This is the sound I need to frequently bathe my brain in, and it was so nice to find someone else making it.</p>
<h3 id="2-anna-burch--quit-the-curse">2. Anna Burch — <em>Quit the Curse</em></h3>
<p>On her debut record, Anna Burch sounds like the finished article. And she’s bringing along a complex melding of folk, art-rock, indie, and old-fashioned pop hooks. I don’t know how she got surf-adjacent guitar to sit alongside Pavement vocal stylings. Maybe if Ben Kweller and Lana Del Ray covered Surfer Blood, and you played it back at 2/3 speed it would sound like this?</p>
<p>However she’s managing to do it, and make it sound effortless, <em>Quit The Curse</em> is a very pretty record with its makeup smudged, wearing the same clothes it wore yesterday. I could listen to it all day. Try ‘2 Cool 2 Care’ and ‘In Your Dreams’ and you’ll either fall head over heels for it, or discover your heart has been hardened against all the world’s beauty.</p>
<h3 id="1-aal-against-all-logic--2012-2017">1. AAL (Against All Logic) — <em>2012-2017</em></h3>
<p>OK, this is where the fun begins. First of all, don’t be fooled by the artist’s name: this is a new record by Nicolas Jaar, working under one of his many monikers – presumably to avoid being pigeonholed. His previous release, <em>Sirens</em> (2016), was one I struggled with leaving off my list for that year. I had no such internal conflict with this one; right from the first time I heard it (in February), I knew that <em>2012-2017</em> would make the final cut.</p>
<p>Where I do need to make special pleading, arguably, is the fact that some of the work here has appeared within continuous mixes that Jaar has done for various outlets over the last couple of years. Many tracks are entirely new, but portions of a few have cropped up before. Nevertheless, this is the first time any of the work has been released in record format, so I’m claiming it.</p>
<p>This is precisely at the epicentre of one of my favourite electronica subgenres: endlessly exploratory, and happy to bring in influences from all over the musical spectrum to colour its own sound. Opener ‘This Old House Is All I Have’ twists blues into the mix, album highlight ’Know You’ hijacks soul and funk… and so on. But the record’s sound is also miraculously cohesive and quite singular, providing consistent thrills throughout. Some of music’s most thrilling moments of 2018 are contained herein for me, and they’re couched in a shifting bed of melody that I was absolutely entranced by.<br>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2018/10/07/public-metrics-on.html">Public Metrics on Social Networks</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2018/10/07/public-metrics-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-10-06 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Oct 6, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m convinced that many of the problems with social networks are attributable primarily to the way in which they handle metrics. Data is routinely made public without consideration as to its utility, and as a direct result users are coached to use the services in ways counter to their own interests.</p>
<p>Taking Twitter as an example, consider the various things for which the user is presented a numerical value on their own profile: Tweets; Tweets &amp; Replies; Followers; Following; Lists; Likes; Moments; Notifications; Direct Messages. For the most part these are purely informational with respect to one’s own account; only Notifications and Direct Messages may include calls to action. Now consider the categories of information available when viewing another user’s public account: Tweets; Following; Followers; Likes; Lists. Do any of these numbers, as they relate to another person’s account, have any value to you? Let’s take each one in turn:</p>
<p>• <strong>Tweets</strong>: Reading an account’s public posts is obviously central to how Twitter functions, but there is no need to display a count of how many posts they’ve made overall.</p>
<p>• <strong>Following</strong>: It may be of interest to you to see which accounts a person follows. I would argue that this should be something that each individual user of Twitter should have the ability to share or keep private. In either case, there is no good reason to display the number of accounts they follow.</p>
<p>• <strong>Followers</strong>: The same is true here. You might be interested to see who follows an account, but this should be something the account holder chooses whether or not to share. Regardless, there is no need to display the number of followers an account has.</p>
<p>• <strong>Likes</strong>: I can see no reason to display the number of posts an account holder has liked. As above with Following &amp; Followers, this should be something the account holder can choose to reveal or not. I feel Twitter’s <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html">introduction of Bookmarks</a> in February 2018 — whilst they certainly have valid alternative uses — was partly a tacit admission that Likes being public isn’t ideal.</p>
<p>• <strong>Lists</strong>: Compared with the others the number next to Lists is of little consequence, but the reasons why are revealing. Firstly, Lists are an aspect of Twitter over which the user <em>does</em> have complete control with respect to their public / private status. Private Lists do not show on a user’s Profile, and are not included in the count of Lists. Secondly, there is no judgment associated with the number of Lists one maintains.</p>
<p>This last point brings us to the second part of the argument. Not only does the public nature of these numbers have no <em>positive</em> value, it is often detrimental to the functioning of the service. Social networks are a messy hybrid of communication, publication, and advertising. Nothing good comes of the lines between these functions being blurred or erased, and nothing contributes more to this problem than public metrics. When the count of one’s Tweets, Followers, and Likes is unalterably public, one feels some pressure to keep an eye on the numbers, and quite possibly alter one’s behaviour on the platform (to one degree or another) to change them in the manner one desires to see them change. There is an important distinction here: for example between ‘wanting more followers’ and ‘wanting to <em>be seen</em> to have more followers’. The former may be rooted in a number of motivations, some of them beneficent. The latter is only really attributable to anxiety over reputation, and does no one any good.</p>
<p>The effect of this is even more detrimental in the case of individual posts. Publicly displaying the number of replies, likes, and retweets that a tweet has received is the single worst element of Twitter. Based on a growing corpus of research (such as that by the <a href="https://humanetech.com">Center for Humane Technology</a>) it is increasingly clear that algorithmically-curated services amplify content with a strong emotional valence. Put simply, a post that elicits strong responses gets interacted with more than a neutral post. More people reply, share, like etc., and as a result the system learns that these posts are more valuable. The next step is that the system makes these posts more visible or prioritises them in other ways, which leads to yet more engagement. This is true of content with a positive emotional valence, but it is particularly the case with negative emotional valences. Nothing travels faster and further, or garners more attention on social networks than outrage.</p>
<p>And as much as we’d like to pin this entirely on the algorithms, we’re not blameless in the equation. The lesson we’ve learned from using these networks is the same one the algorithms have learned: in order to get more engagement with our posts, we should post more extreme content. If you want a lot of visibility for your posts it’s better to make them confrontational. If you want your opinion to be noticed it’s more effective to inflate it cartoonishly. And the way you receive feedback on whether it’s working or not is by keeping an eye on the numbers. How many replies; how many retweets; how many likes? What should I do differently next time to make those numbers go up?</p>
<p>Think of this in terms of Instagram, where Likes and Comments are also tabulated publicly. Here the extremes are less likely to be around emotionality, and more commonly to do with beauty or æsthetics. If you post a photo of yourself or your living room decor on a platform where the metrics are publicly viewable, you’re going to naturally be concerned with how it will be received. Not ‘do I like how I look’ but ‘will <em>others</em> like how I look’ in this picture? When the numbers come back and they’re not what you’d hoped for, you naturally make adjustments to how you will present yourself next time.</p>
<p>This is behaviour modification by way of public score-keeping. It’s one thing that you can see that your selfie only got 6 likes, but it’s infinitely worse that <em>everyone else</em> has that information too. There is no reason that the number of engagements with a post should be publicly viewable. The only thing these metrics track accurately is popularity, and that is the least reliable and most widely misinterpreted guide as to value. That something is popular does not make it good. That something is unpopular does not make it bad. That outrage is more virulent than reason does not make it a better response.</p>
<p>Imagine the effects of removing these numbers from public display. You can still find out how many people, and whom, liked your post if you so wish, but no one else can. The benefits of altering one’s behaviour or appearance for a future post are entirely removed, as no one will know whether one post is more popular than another. Think of the times that a news report relies on the volume of engagement with a social network post as an indicator of veracity. It’s inaccurate and potentially dangerous to do so, but it’s common practice – such is the ease with which we mistake ‘popular’ for ‘good’ or ‘true’. It’s a problem easily remedied if the metrics are made private.</p>
<p>These numbers might mean something to you as a user. It bears asking yourself <em>what</em> they mean to you and <em>why</em>. How much of it is because other people see them too? Do you look to the numbers displayed on other people’s accounts and posts as indicators of anything other than popularity? And what value do you place on raw popularity where that’s all that’s being measured?</p>
<p>The unfortunate element of this that should be mentioned is that anything and everything that increases traffic and engagement is by default a positive thing as far as the operators of social networks are concerned. These are free-to-use, advertising-supported platforms, and keeping as many people as possible engaged for as long as possible is their <em>modus operandi</em>. If pushing emotionally charged content is what accomplishes that goal, that’s what they’ll do. And if keeping all of these metrics publicly visible means that users spend more time on the service trying to get their numbers up, that’s a good thing for the advertisers and therefore for the service. As far as I can see, that is the primary obstacle to making this data private (either optionally or by default). I certainly can’t see the benefit to the user of it remaining public.</p>

			 <p>Recently I got to try something I’ve been intrigued by for some time: sensory deprivation. I don’t remember where I first learned about the idea, but since I became aware of it I’ve seen it pitched as the centre of a Venn diagram between spa treatment and mindfulness experience. The core principle is simply to remove as much external stimulus as possible. That means absolute darkness, near silence, and weightless suspension in water heated to your body temperature, such that gravity and touch are counterbalanced.</p>
<p>In a private room, the first step is to take a quick shower whilst the pod finishes its cleaning cycle. Whilst it’s doing this the water bubbles gently and is lit pink by an underwater LED. I felt a little apprehensive about the whole thing at this point, simply because it’s so unlike anything else I’ve done. I would class myself as an experienced novice at meditation. It has been a while since I maintained a regular practice, but I probably have a few hundred hours’ of zazen over the course of two decades. In theory the state inside the tank is one that you seek during meditation: a still place in which to be alone with the breath. But any meditator will tell you that it’s not <em>external</em> stimuli, but the mind, that presents the most persistent obstacle – and I was due to take my mind in with me.</p>
<p>My entry into the tank was graceless. Not only are the surfaces plastic, and as such kind of slippy like the average bathtub, but the water fights you immediately. The 300kg of magnesium sulfate dissolved in the 1,000L of water means you float like a rubber duck. Whilst bobbing around, trying to reach up behind me to pull the lid of the tank down, I felt as ridiculous as I likely looked.</p>
<p>Once that was out of the way, I had a few moments to try and settle in. The pink light remained on in the pod, and the water continued to bubble gently around me. I considered and then rejected the earplugs that had been provided, and made several attempts to find a comfortable position for my arms. In the end I opted to have my hands resting underneath my head. And no sooner had I got that figured out, than the light and the pump shut off. Absolute darkness. Darkness that felt like it had a weight and texture. And complete silence unless I actively made a sound. I’ll admit that the nullification of my senses freaked me out at first. Understanding intellectually what the experience entails, and going into it, are two very different things. A couple of times, just to check I hadn’t entirely disappeared from existence, I moved my foot to splash some water, or stretched out and heard my back crack. Otherwise all I could hear was the beat of my heart.</p>
<p>For a little over an hour I floated; just me, in an enclosed pod about the size of a single bed. I found that, just like meditation when you’re not in the habit, the trickiest part was remembering that there was nothing to do – nothing I <em>should</em> be doing. I, at least, am so accustomed to asking myself whether I’m doing any given task ‘correctly’ or ‘well’ that it becomes reflexive for those questions to arise consistently in my subconscious. Several times throughout the hour I caught myself wondering whether I was floating as I ‘should’ be, or if I was having the ‘right’ thoughts during the experience. In meditation you learn that the mind thinks like the lungs breathe and the heart beats – it happens naturally and it’s not something you can stop; the key is in how you direct you attention. I found floating to be a similar experience.</p>
<p>I had heard beforehand that to many people the hour doesn’t feel like an hour. I didn’t sleep, as some people choose to do, but I did have the experience that the time seemed to pass quite quickly. I have certainly sat half hour sessions of zazen, with a sore lower back and numbing butt, that felt <em>a lot</em> longer. My uneducated guess is that this has something to do with how the mind processes time: that devoid of external stimulus your ability to approximate duration becomes increasingly inexact. When the water began to bubble gently, and then the pink light came on, I climbed (gracelessly) out of the pod. Momentarily it was odd to feel the weight of my own limbs again, and under my feet the grit of a little epsomite that dusted the floor. I showered once more, rinsing the salts off my skin and out of my hair, dressed, and made my way back out of the spa to surprisingly bright sunlight.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the day I felt calm, and more comfortable than normal moving at a slower pace, both physically and mentally. Restful, is probably the most appropriate word I can use. I was glad I didn’t have anything else planned for the day, as it meant I could just enjoy the feeling until I headed to bed a little earlier than usual.</p>
<p>It’s something that I’d like to repeat, I think. If for no other reason than to bypass the initial stage of apprehension at the unfamiliar, lessen the period needed for adjustment, and be able to settle in more quickly to the experience itself. I’d also encourage you to try it if it’s something you’re half curious about. As strange a way as it might seem to sign off an eight paragraph description of an experience, it’s kind of indescribable.</p>

			 <p>It’s been a while since I fell head-over-heels for a comic. I was on board with <em>Paper Girls</em> (2015) from the start, and the first issue of <em>Pearl</em> (2018) was excellent, but the last time I was instantly <em>wowed</em> was probably when I picked up the first <em>Saga</em> trade paperback in 2012. That is until Saturday morning, when I read all five published issues of Brenden Fletcher &amp; Karl Kerschl’s <em>Isola</em> (2018).</p>
<p>Tell me this isn’t just the most compelling opening:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/6a87a95619.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the great pleasures of fantasy fiction, in any medium, is the opportunity to immerse oneself in new worlds. And the genre’s largest potential pitfall is that exposition of the world’s rules and realities requires subtlety and skill. Everything about this book is brilliantly handled. Fletcher &amp; Kerschl’s script is perfectly judged, deftly providing the reader with what they <em>need</em> to know, whilst allowing room for plenty of mystery and wonder at the edges of the story.</p>
<p>Kerschl’s art is by turns evocative, precise, and dynamic; there doesn’t seem to be anything he can’t depict perfectly. Look, for example, at the motion in this page:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/9bee7ba777.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And he’s working alongside an absolutely peerless colourist in Michele “MSASSYK” Assarasakorn. I was consistently knocked out by her use of a broad but controlled palate, and the richness in each panel. Check out the lush greens on this page, on which she also comes the closest I have ever seen to capturing sunlight:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/b3d3a97004.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Even the lettering – the most frequently overlooked and under-appreciated discipline in comics – is remarkable. Without commanding undue attention on the page Aditya Bidikar does an excellent job of representing the varied languages of the world (including sub-vocal). And there are also some neat little moments like this, which I thought worked perfectly to capture two characters’ relationship and history:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/2eb8a41d94.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All of this comes together to make an amazing book. I simply don’t see pages like this too often:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/1c4a98dc20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I cannot recommend <em>Isola</em> strongly enough. I was absolutely captivated throughout, and I’m already counting down to the January release of issue 6 — its world is one I’m eager to get back to.</p>

			 <p>It’s a near certainty that over the last few weeks you’ve received several emails asking you to consent to companies’ amended privacy policies. The short version of the story is that this shift in how companies handle your data has been inspired by the advent of a new piece of EU legislation: the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gdpr-is-here">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->GDPR<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It’s not a panacea – and goodness knows the raft of emails it inspired was irritating – but it’s a step forward in data privacy, and notably it establishes a European position even further advanced beyond the US one than was previously the case.</p>
<p>Several of the bigger operators in online services (ie. those companies whose main business is the providing of online services, as opposed to companies who do other things but have a web presence) have offered a data export service for some time. <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">Google Takeout</a> was the first I had any cause to interact with, and I found it an admirably simple and transparent process. As part of the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, more people seemed to be made aware of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/">Facebook’s data export service</a>. Requesting one’s data from these companies, and receiving it in a giant ZIP file, can be quite overwhelming – particularly if you’ve been a heavy user of their products for some time. But it’s also fascinating. The cache of information you might readily associate with your interactions with the company makes up a small portion of the total: a visible peak of the proverbial data iceberg. The rest of the folder is full of stuff you had either known at some point that they were collecting, but had forgotten, or that you had no idea was being collected in the first place. I recommend doing it if only for the weird feeling of being presented with a box of facts about yourself that someone else has taken note of.</p>
<p>Whether directly inspired by GDPR or not, <a href="https://privacy.apple.com">Apple recently started offering a data export service</a>. So, out of nothing more than sheer curiosity, I requested everything they have on me. Excavating the folder that came back has been super-interesting. Here are a few select pieces of what’s included.</p>
<p>• Every Apple device ever associated with my account, and every firmware version that has ever been installed on each.</p>
<p>• Every email address, physical address, and payment option ever associated with my account.</p>
<p>• Every device from which I have ever logged into my account. This included items like ‘RIVERSIDE22’: my work PC at a job I had in 2009, and listings such as ‘Mendicant Bias’ and ‘Penitent Tangent’ from when I used to name my machines using embarrassingly nerdy references (2011).</p>
<p>• Predictably, every purchase I have ever made from iTunes, starting with my first: ‘Kiss Me’ by Sixpence None the Richer on 5 Aug 2005.</p>
<p>• Also, every free item I’ve downloaded from an Apple digital store.</p>
<p>• Every song and album I’ve played on MUSIC; how many times I’ve listened to it; when I first played it, and when I last played it.</p>
<p>• A complete catalogue of every song or album I have expressed a binary opinion about on MUSIC.</p>
<p>• Hilariously, a subfolder containing a separate document that simply lists the tracks from the U2 album <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, which Apple infamously forced upon everybody with an internet connected iOS device in 2014, and which the majority of us deleted instantly.</p>
<p>• Every item for which I have engaged in the dubious practice of pre-ordering a digital good.</p>
<p>• Every item I’ve ever watched on my TV, including a timestamp of where I left off. (A playcount is also included, revealing my worrying <em>Mr Robot</em> viewing habits.)</p>
<p>• A <em>colossal</em> spreadsheet listing every episode of every podcast I have ever listened to, the date I listened to it, a timestamp of where I left off, and whether or not I am subscribed to the podcast in question.</p>
<p>• A list of all my iBooks purchases, alongside separate documents that mark the position I’ve reached in each book, any highlighting I’ve done, and any annotations that I’ve added.</p>
<p>• Every review I’ve left for an item in an Apple digital store, including the rating out of 5 and any comments I made.</p>
<p>• Every time I’ve complained about another customer’s review of a product in an Apple digital store!</p>
<p>• Every app I’ve beta tested via Apple’s Testflight.</p>
<p>• Every store item I’ve ever gifted, and every gift card I’ve ever redeemed (including date of redemption and value).</p>
<p>• PDF copies of all of the email receipts sent to me following in-person purchases at an Apple retail store. These go back to the time I bought a blue ‘bumper’ for my iPhone 4 in June 2013.</p>
<p>• Every product for which I’ve taken out AppleCare+.</p>
<p>• Every interaction I’ve had with AppleCare support.</p>
<p>• The transcript of every chat I’ve had with AppleCare support. Interestingly these also include the text of chats between Apple employees relating to the support ticket.</p>
<p>• All of my responses to surveys regarding my customer service experiences.</p>
<p>• All of my earned achievements and leaderboard positions for GameCenter enabled iOS games.</p>
<p>• Safari browsing history and bookmarks are empty folders in my case (because I routinely purge them), but they’re in there.</p>
<p>• Details of recent FaceTime calls and message recipients are also blank in my case because I have a habit of erasing the histories every week. But, it would all otherwise be there.</p>
<p>• Map locations I’ve marked as favourites.</p>
<p>• Copies of all iCloud calendars and Reminder lists (both as .ics files).</p>
<p>• Copies of all my iCloud contacts as vCards.</p>
<p>• Plaintext copies of all items kept in iCloud folders in Notes, with rich media attachments in separate folders. Also, a list of any shared notes, with whom they are shared, and the applicable permission structure.</p>
<p>• Every correction I’ve submitted to the Apple Maps team, including screenshots.</p>
<p>• An .xml file of every wifi network I’ve connected to and chosen to remember the login credentials for.</p>
<p>• Finally, in a folder named ‘Other Data’, an absolutely colossal spreadsheet listing every action involving my iCloud storage. It’s a chronological list of every photo / video I’ve uploaded to iCloud, and every time it’s been downloaded on another device; every time I’ve deleted a file from iCloud storage; every time I’ve recovered a recently deleted file; every time I’ve uploaded, downloaded, and deleted a photo from my Photo Stream; every interaction I’ve had with photos / videos in a shared album; every document added to iCloud Drive, and every time I’ve modified one or deleted one; every time I’ve applied a tag to a file in iCloud Drive; every time I’ve enabled or disabled an app to work with iCloud Drive… basically any time anything I’ve done has touched my iCloud storage. Interestingly it’s named ‘iCloudUsageData Set1.csv’ and contains entries only for the last couple of months (it’s still thousands and thousands of rows).</p>
<p>Awe is not something one expects to feel when looking at a series of spreadsheets, but I’m in awe of the engineering it must take to build a system like this. Notably absent from this trove of data is the more personal stuff. I’m an Watch user, and none of the data around my heart rate, exercise habits etc. is here. I also use the Health app and Medical ID on iPhone, and so those apps have information on my weight, blood type, medical history etc. That data is also not included here. Apple has made clear from the launch of those products that user privacy is paramount, and (outside of your devices) that data is only contained in backups the user creates locally <em>and chooses to have encrypted</em>. Similarly the text of iMessage chats is not part of the data that Apple keeps; those are encrypted end-to-end and unreadable by anyone but the sender and recipient, including Apple.</p>
<p>It’s also worth thinking for a moment about why Apple keeps the data that it does. In the vast majority of cases it is kept in order to improve the user’s experience. If I download a film or a podcast episode to a new device and it picks up where I last stopped playing it, I don’t think about the giant spreadsheet that made that possible – I’m just delighted that it works that way. All of the ratings I’ve given items on MUSIC are used to generate custom playlists more to my liking. And, don’t forget the small miracle of logging into a brand new device with one’s AppleID and having all of one’s data available effortlessly: contacts, calendars, notes, music, photos etc. etc. etc. Depending on your age you might recall the stressful, laborious processes involved in transferring all of this stuff before the ubiquity of the cloud.</p>
<p>In short, there’s nothing here that I disagree with Apple retaining. And a large part of that is because I know it is not part of Apple’s business model to leverage this data for their own gain. The data that Facebook and Google retain on you is certainly used to improve your experience with their products, but it is also used to enable their business models, which are reliant almost exclusively on advertising. Despite its growing array of products (digital and physical) <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266471/distribution-of-googles-revenues-by-source/">86% of Google’s revenue still comes from advertisers</a>. In Facebook’s case <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267031/facebooks-annual-revenue-by-segment/">the figure is 98%</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking omission is the fact that there is no record of purchases I’ve made using Pay. Such data points would likely be too potentially rich a seam of information for an advertiser-dependent company to resist collecting, speaking directly as it would to my purchasing habits, preferred brands, and so on.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most.

<h3 id="20-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-3">20. Run The Jewels — <em>Run the Jewels 3</em></h3>
<p>As I write this Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Damn</em> is topping year-end lists left and right and I’m wondering what I missed on an album I just didn’t connect with. Of the hip-hop that passed through my headphones this year I had a good time with Vince Staples’s <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, really liked Open Mike Eagle’s <em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em> (but spent too little time with it), and bounced off most of the big hitters to one degree or another: as well as <em>Damn</em>, Jay-Z’s lukewarm <em>4:44</em> and Drake’s <em>More Life</em> did little for me, and I’ve never clicked with the Migos thing.</p>
<p>That leaves room for only one rap record on this year’s list, but it’s a doozy. RTJ remain a complete enigma to me: I don’t know how they came together, I don’t know why they give every record away instead of selling them, and I don’t know why their combo of braggadocio, political engagement, and downright silliness works (this is a mix that only seems to work in hip-hop, with Beastie Boys as perhaps the flag-bearers) – I’m just grateful for it all.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Legend Has It’ is one of my most quoted songs of the year (for better or worse). It’s just the right mix of all the magic elements that make RTJ special. The moment when El P’s girlfriend interrupts to stop him completing one particularly crude line makes me smile, if not laugh, every time.</p>
<h3 id="19-portico-quartet--art-in-the-age-of-automation">19. Portico Quartet — <em>Art in the Age of Automation</em></h3>
<p>There were three records this year that I returned to time and again for a dose of calm, reflective ambience: one didn’t quite make the list (Andrew Bird’s <em>Echolocations: River</em>), one is further up this list, and the latest from Portico Quartet is the third.
Once again a four-piece following the departure of founding member Nick Mulvey and one record as a trio (renamed, simply Portico), <em>AitAoA</em> finds the band taking another progressive step with their sound. When they took 8th spot on my list in 2012 (with their eponymous LP), I ended my write-up by saying I was excited to see what was next. Actually, 2015’s <em>Living Fields</em> didn’t quite chime for me – essentially an electronica album, with some guest vocals I could live without, it felt like a band deliberately trying to make a clean break with the past, and ignoring their strengths to do so. This year’s record (following the addition to the roster of Kier Vine) feels like a very deliberate further sonic evolution, which brings back the more organic instrumentation and cuts the vocals. It’s precisely what I wanted from the follow up to Portico Quartet, and perhaps their strongest album to date.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Current History’ takes as its base an effervescent, <em>Amnesiac</em>-style percussion pattern and layers tones and loops on top.</p>
<h3 id="18-death-from-above--outrage-is-now">18. Death From Above — <em>Outrage! Is Now</em></h3>
<p>Here’s something I wrote when DFA’s <em>The Physical World</em> took top spot in my list for 2014:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power is a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what kind of albums this band could have made in the decade-long interval between their studio debut and its follow-up? Perhaps it took that time, and the up &amp; down intra-bandmate relationship, to make that second record. Whatever the case, I’m glad we didn’t have to wait so long for a third LP.</p>
<p>Sebastien Grainger is a great drummer and Jesse F. Keeler is a great bassist; both have a great ear for infectious hooks, and they share a willingness to push their compositions as far as they’ll go: harder, faster, heavier, groovier. Perhaps the least talked about weapon in the band’s arsenal is Grainger’s voice; it’s a passionate, vaulting, wonderfully tuneful thing that serves as a solid third pillar in their song-craft.</p>
<p><em>Outrage! Is Now</em> sounds like DFA. It sounds like someone lent them a couple of synths, but it’s unmistakably the same racket they made on the previous records. And man does it still get me!?</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Nvr 4Evr’ is classic DFA; the kind of track that bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club wish they’d written.</p>
<h3 id="17-beck--colors">17. Beck — <em>Colors</em></h3>
<p>Do you remember that part in <em>Superman Returns</em> where Lex Luther explains to Kitty Kowalski that crystals take on the properties of the elements that surround them? I feel that Beck operates in a similar fashion: whatever given sound or vibe he turns his attention to, he’s able to produce music that feels authentic. Sometimes it’s meditative (eg. <em>Sea Change</em> (2002)), sometimes a little sombre (eg. <em>Morning Phase</em> (2014)), and sometimes poppy and easygoing (eg. <em>Odelay</em> (1996) &amp; <em>Guero</em> (2005)). And no matter which category he’s playing in, Beck’s consistently doing something interesting with it. Whether it’s Brazilian influences on <em>Guero</em>, or the hip-hop touches to <em>The Information</em> (2006), Beck is a restlessly inventive artist in the same mould as Madonna or Björk (perhaps it’s something to do with the mononyms?).
<em>Colors</em> is Beck in full-on pop assault mode. And he’s happy to pull from anywhere and everywhere to make it happen. Shamelessly detuned guitars and anthemic choruses; jaunty Beatles-esque piano; ’No Distraction’ sounds like Sting collaborating with The Killers.
In sum it’s the same trick that Daniel Johns et al managed to pull off with <em>Young Modern</em> (2007): the making of a pop album on one’s own artistic terms. It’s not quite as strange (or as sublime) as that Silverchair record, but both are unmistakably the work of diversely-talented musicians making a direct assault on whatever part of the brain responds to catchy pop music.</p>
<p>Highlight: The panpipe melody that runs through title track ‘Colors’ – anything that can make me love the sound of an instrument I previously hated has to be doing something right.</p>
<h3 id="16-the-xx--i-see-you">16. The xx — <em>I See You</em></h3>
<p>To my ears the third album from The xx sounds like a natural progression of a sound that started off very simple and somewhat reserved, and has blossomed into a form somewhat brighter, self-assured, and colourful. It’s only natural, in fact, that the band’s third album as a trio takes notes from <em>In Colour</em>, Jamie xx’s vibrant, dance-floor friendly solo album of 2015 (#8 on that year’s List). The blaring horns that start the record were called out by several reviewers as a shock departure for The xx’s sound; but the shock was far less if you’d allowed Jamie’s solo LP to work its magic on you a couple of years previously.</p>
<p>All of which is not to say that <em>I See You</em> sounds entirely different from its predecessors. The heart of the record is still the haunted, sleek blend of trip-hop and the lighter side of the EDM spectrum. And the songwriting is still coming from somewhere intensely personal. It’s not necessary to know about the friction between bandmates that sits behind tracks like ‘Say Something Loving’, and ‘Test Me’ in order to feel that these are songs crafted by people who felt them intensely.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘On Hold’ seemed a bit divisive when it was released ahead of the album, as it calls out the departures that The xx’s sound was taking on the record. Some reacted with shock or disappointment, but I was onboard immediately.</p>
<h3 id="15-submerse--are-you-anywhere">15. Submerse — <em>Are You Anywhere</em></h3>
<p>For my money <em>Are You Anywhere</em> represents as strong a set of tracks as Submerse has released since I’ve been listening to him, starting with <em>Slow Waves</em> – which was my number 5 album of 2014. (<em>Stay Home</em> just missed out on a spot in 2015, and in 2016 he grabbed 13th for <em>Awake</em>.) Both the mix of organic &amp; electronic elements, and the dazed-sounding production, are familiar from previous albums, and the spell that’s cast here is just as effective on me as ever.</p>
<p>In four albums and a couple of EPs over the last four years Submerse hasn’t really made much of a departure from his core sound. However, it’s a sound that I can’t get enough of, and my only complaint here is that 31 minutes is too short a time to spend in this sonic space.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Too Many Sidequests’ makes use of Submerse’s knack for incorporating video game sound effects into alien soundscapes.</p>
<h3 id="14-inheaven--inheaven">14. INHEAVEN — <em>INHEAVEN</em></h3>
<p>What happened to The Subways? Wikipedia says they’re still extant, but nothing’s been released in 5 years, and I don’t remember hearing anything in nearly a decade. Anyway: INHEAVEN have made a pretty great record in the same mould, with perhaps a bit more Pixies influence (hence the name, I guess), and a bit more lightness in its step. It’s loud, it’s brash, and it’s unashamedly fun more-or-less from start to finish.</p>
<p>Songs like ‘Treats’ &amp; ‘Vulture’ are designed for chanting along to, and I can’t listen to them without imagining what they would do to the front half of Brixton Academy. But this is a band that does have at least one gear above ‘simple crowd-pleasing stomper’ and it’s telling that several of the tracks here very quickly feel as though you’ve known them for a long time.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Stupid Things’ is half sickly-sweet pop song and half tender-hearted confession.</p>
<h3 id="13-toro-y-moi--boo-boo">13. Toro y Moi — <em>Boo Boo</em></h3>
<p>Chaz Bear took fourth spot in 2015 with <em>What For?</em>, and it’s largely the same formula of dreamy tones, soft beats, and lightly-treated vocals that has him back on the list this time. ‘Mirage’ kicks off the album as it means to go on, and when it pauses three minutes in for Chaz to intone “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there”, I 100% believe that this music is just the soundtrack to his life, and we’re just showing up to peep in for another 50 minute dose.</p>
<p>The sound palate that <em>Boo Boo</em> shares with <em>What For?</em> is pretty singular – it’s identifiable within a couple of bars as TyM – and, as such, it’s likely to be a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Personally I find the relaxed, pastel-infused vibes on these records to be borderline medicinal.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Girl Like You’ sounds like an 80s chart pop song (which I absolutely do not intend as a pejorative) fed through Chaz’s particular filter, and it comes out sounding no less sweet but perhaps a bit more interesting.</p>
<h3 id="12-charly-bliss--guppy">12. Charly Bliss — <em>Guppy</em></h3>
<p>Remember that dog. (mandatory lower case and full stop) – 90s grunge-influenced, optimismcore / original recipe emo LA outfit who released at least one and maybe two masterpieces on Geffen? There’s still a part of me that identifies strongly with late 90s cartoon misanthrope Daria, and in that guise I love both that dog. and, now, Charly Bliss. They’re from the other coast, and they’re 20 years late, but there’s no doubting they’re playing from the heart, and maybe that’s all you need to rekindle an old sound. It certainly worked on me instantly; there are guitar sounds on this record I haven’t heard since <em>Pinkerton</em> and, turns out, I’ve been missing them dearly.</p>
<p>Infectious; exuberant; wilfully, naively upbeat… I need more of this sound in my life. There’s not much depth to what’s on offer here, but there doesn’t have to be. At least for a couple of records let’s just close our eyes and pretend it’s a couple of decades ago.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Ruby’ just might be my favourite song of the year. Pixies bass, vintage Weezer guitar, and one of the album’s best lilting, acrobatic vocals. If you’ll forgive the pun, it’s kind of blissful.</p>
<h3 id="11-shigeto--the-new-monday">11. Shigeto — <em>The New Monday</em></h3>
<p>When I grow up I want to be Jason Heyward, five-time Gold Glove winner and flawless right-fielder for the Chicago Cubs. One of the many problems with that is that Heyward is eight years younger than me. So my second choice is Zachary Shigeto Saginaw. (I’m pretty sure Shigeto is also younger than me, but I don’t know that for a fact!)</p>
<p>My first Shigeto record was <em>No Better Time Than Now</em>, 17th spot on this list for 2013, and I’ve been captivated ever since by his particular blend of electronica, hip-hop, and jazz. He’s endlessly inventive, effortlessly cool, and seemingly always able to capture a new sound or put a new spin on an old one. He’s also a ridiculous drummer. (I highly recommend watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DduNRXh3h3o">videos of his live performances</a>.)</p>
<p><em>The New Monday</em> is right up there with <em>No Better Time…</em> for me. I’m still listening to the earlier record, and I have no trouble believing I’ll still be playing this in five years.</p>
<p>Highlight: Opener ‘Detroit Pt II’ is an evolution of one of <em>No Better Time Than Now’s</em> strongest tracks: ‘Detroit Pt I’.</p>
<p>(Side note: Shigeto isn’t flawless. He put out another record this year as a duo with vocalist ZelooperZ, as ZGTO. I did not get on with that album at all! Still, even Jason Heyward drops a ball now and then.)</p>
<h3 id="10-paramore--after-laughter">10. Paramore — <em>After Laughter</em></h3>
<p>On 2013’s list I excused Paramore’s inclusion at number 12 by joking that I am, in fact, a 15-year old girl. Quite why one tends to feel some form of guilt or shame for liking certain things, I don’t know. So in that spirit, though I might like to make another joke, I have to hold my hand up now and say that this band makes really good pop-rock albums, and I love them without reservation.</p>
<p>There is likely nothing here to win over new fans. But, that said, there are some new departures in terms of sound. Overall the instrumentation feels more heavily weighted to electronic drums and synths where it would have been more uniformly guitars previously. Several of the tracks have a synthy, 80s vibe to them, telegraphed upfront by the Kraftwerk outro to opener ‘Hard Times’. Hayley Williams’s voice remains the group’s distinguishing factor, and is in fine form throughout here: by turns angry, soothing, empowered &amp; empowering, and never less than note-perfect.</p>
<p>More of this please. Thanks.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Fake Happy’ begins as an acoustic sketch and blossoms into a Cyndi Lauper-esque stomper straight from the heart.</p>
<h3 id="9-arcade-fire--everything-now">9. Arcade Fire — <em>Everything Now</em></h3>
<p>I don’t know how they do it, but every time a new Arcade Fire album comes out I go through a period of disappointment, which lasts a few listens, before ultimately it wins me over completely and captures top spot on my year-end list. Well, everything except the final part of that process happened this time around also.</p>
<p>I think there’s something about AF’s music that has this polarising effect on listeners. Spin called <em>Everything Now</em> “deeply cynical” and “joyless”; Pitchfork termed it “pale” and “joyless”, and yet I honestly don’t know what they’re hearing that I’m not, or what I’m hearing that they’re not. There are at least three tracks here that rank among the most musically euphoric the band have ever recorded. Which is maybe why just as many reviewers gave opinions similar to that of Slant, who thought <em>Everything Now</em> “by far Arcade Fire&rsquo;s most upbeat… album to date”.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to disagree on the quality of an album, but in my experience this level of disparity on something like a record’s tone is very unusual. Maybe this is a band that makes emotionally confusing music, that takes the listener a while to catch up to.
In short, this is still a band without a bad song in their catalogue. ‘Everything Now’, ‘Creature Comfort’, and ‘Put Your Money on Me’ are some of the best songs they’ve recorded, and yet this is their weakest album as a whole. After <em>White Blood Cells</em> and <em>Elephant</em> sometimes there’s an <em>Icky Thump</em>; after <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em> you’re allowed to make <em>The King of Limbs</em>. In both cases, as here, those are very strong records outshone by all their siblings.</p>
<p>Highlight: The slow build of the ABBA-indebted ‘Put Your Money on Me’ is masterly. How something can sound simultaneously sad and like an 80s disco classic is… confusing.</p>
<h3 id="8-lusine--sensorimotor">8. Lusine — <em>Sensorimotor</em></h3>
<p>Back in March I was taking an early morning flight to the UK. It was due to depart Iceland at just after 06:00, which meant arriving at the airport sometime around 04:00; and to get to the airport there’s a ~45 minute coach ride from Reykjavik. That’s too early to pay attention to a podcast, or to concentrate on a book under some tiny, ineffective reading light. So I pressed play on a record I’d added to my library simply because I add everything that Ghostly International release to my library. It seems probable to me that <em>Sensorimotor</em> will always remind me of that drive out to the airport in the early morning dark. That’s just what the album sounds like to me now.
The backbone of the record is a collection of bass beats and superior electronic sweeps. Out of which are composed a series of haunted sonic landscapes that feel monochromatic and restless, like a brain roused too early from sleep it would prefer to return to.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Slow Motion’ is a bundle of nervous energy laid over a kick that sounds like a skipping heartbeat.</p>
<h3 id="7-four-tet--new-energy">7. Four Tet — <em>New Energy</em></h3>
<p>I’ve been listening to Four Tet now for a little less than 15 years. In that time there have been some notable shifts in focus for the music that Kieran Hebden is creating. <em>Rounds</em> (2003) was the record that kicked off my interest, and is still held as the epitome of a certain (now possibly extinct?) sub-sub-genre somewhat awkwardly termed &lsquo;folktronica&rsquo;. <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> (2005) was vibrant and urgent, and in some ways presaged the shift that followed it. <em>There is Love in You</em> (2010) &amp; <em>Pink</em> (2012) felt more like collections of tracks designed for the dance-floor. Not that they weren’t enjoyable coming through headphones or home speakers, just that the records themselves felt a little less cohesive even if they still retained the power to excite and move. This period was capped off with <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> (2013), which felt like the culmination of that particular sound for Hebden. The bifurcated nature of the EP <em>Morning / Evening</em> (2015) was a leading sign of the next shift that Four Tet’s music would take.</p>
<p>To me, even on first listen, <em>New Energy</em> feels like that latest sound’s full arrival. Unmistakably there are call-backs to what has come before – in fact the sound might best be thought of as a seamless amalgamation of everything Four Tet has released to this point. And that’s some feat. This is a complex, multi-layered work that bears repeated listening, but which engages the listener on a very human level. Warm, open, and never less than a joy to listen to.</p>
<p>Highlight: Tough to pick one, but right now the steady, hypnotic ebb of ‘Daughter’ is my favourite. That will change tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="6-st-vincent--masseduction">6. St. Vincent — <em>MASSEDUCTION</em></h3>
<p>Annie Clark nabbed second spot in 2014 with her previous, eponymous album; I’ve been waiting impatiently ever since to find out what would come next. The answer, it seems, is another very fine collection of postmodern agit-pop that contains more ideas in each song than many bands have on a record.</p>
<p>For me, there’s no ‘Digital Witness’ here, and perhaps not quite a ‘Birth in Reverse’, but this is one of those cases where comparison purely to the artist’s own catalogue gives a misleading picture. Simply put: not many musicians are making music like Annie Clark. Maybe it feels particularly acute in the post-Bowie / post-Prince world, but I find myself at pains to find and applaud this kind of brave, soul-searching, uncomfortable artistry. St. Vincent is an artist working in rarified air, way up there on the art-rock mountain. I will gladly continue to receive any and every transmission she sends down to us.</p>
<p>Highlight: ’Pills’ is the off-kilter, whirligig result of Clark processing the modern condition, both her own and society’s. It’s wild-eyed and sarcastic, but also compassionate. (I recommend <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/st-vincents-seduction-and-my-mothers-career-at-playboy">Clark’s appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour</a>, where she talks about the record and this song in particular.)</p>
<h3 id="5-sampha--process">5. Sampha — <em>Process</em></h3>
<p>I knew Sampha’s voice from no fewer than three 5-star tracks on SBTRKT’s 2014 record <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em> (#3 on my list that year), and a feature on Kanye’s ‘Saint Pablo’. Additionally, though the exact vector escapes me now, somehow I heard Sampha’s track ‘Blood on Me’ toward the end of last year, and knew I had to look out for the album. That song has lost none of its power for me, and is surrounded here by immaculate pieces of songwriting that balance strength and tenderness both sonically and lyrically. Warm beats matched with soft tones play host to Sampha’s voice, which is perhaps the album’s most singular instrument as it floats above the music and dips down into it to play amongst the melodies. Throughout it’s a spectacularly accomplished and self-assured debut, clearly the product of a phenomenally talented musician bringing forth precisely the sound that’s in his head.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano’ is one of those tracks where a musician strips everything back to voice and one instrument and leaves you in awe. As emotionally raw as it is stark in its composition; it’s a striking moment at the centre of the album.</p>
<h3 id="4-fazerdaze--morningside">4. Fazerdaze — <em>Morningside</em></h3>
<p>There are some albums that you want to live inside. Imbued with warmth and brightness throughout, and a sense of weightless flow, <em>Morningside</em> joins my shortlist.
There are elements of shoegaze to the sound, particularly in the way the vocals are treated, but the relative sparseness of the instrumentation and lightness of the production leaves the record feeling open and inviting. It’s notable that several of the tracks get their pace from prominent bass lines that are very effective despite (or perhaps because of) their simplicity. There’s not a great variety to the sound, but the record is only just over the half-hour mark and at ~3 minutes per song it can feel as though each track is a variation on a theme. The result is an understated gem of an indie pop record that I expect to be playing for some time to come.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Lucky Girl’ is perhaps the most distilled form of the record’s sound, and eminently danceable.</p>
<h3 id="3-bing--ruth--no-home-of-the-mind">3. Bing &amp; Ruth — <em>No Home of the Mind</em></h3>
<p>I know very little about the artist(s) behind this record, and I realise that I’ve unconsciously been safeguarding that ignorance so as not to spoil the mystique. This is ambient, post-classic music of precisely the kind I feel most in tune with. By turns haunting, uplifting, and meditative, these are pieces of tremendously adroit, understated composition. The piano is at each track’s centre, but is often found drifting in a sea of warm, shifting tones. The more I listened to it I started to feel as though this album sits somewhere halfway between the Radiohead of ‘Videotape’ &amp; ‘Give Up the Ghost’, and William Basinski’s <em>The Disintegration Loops</em>. It’s a more abstracted version of the former, which retains more of its formal integrity than that latter. And, similar to Basinski’s pieces, I’d be quite happy to play this for hours.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘The How of it Sped’ sounds as though it is accompanying some moment of heartbreak from an unseen film.</p>
<h3 id="2-joywave--content">2. Joywave — <em>Content</em></h3>
<p>I don’t know what to do with this record. It snuck up on me. Joywave have one previous album to their name, which remains unknown to me because I have enough on my plate trying to digest this one.</p>
<p>Comprising an eclectic sound palate (including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…) <em>Content</em> is mercurial in the extreme. The post-nu-metal riff that closes the otherwise danceable paean to lost innocence ‘Rumors’ doesn’t belong on the same album as the quiet, solo-piano lament of ‘Confidence’. But they’re actually sequenced right next to each other. And the latter is 48 seconds long. And it works!
There are obvious allusions to Radiohead circa <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) here, but Joywave occupy a dancier, groovier space than the Oxford set. Lyrically though, they’re dealing with similar themes – technology and its effect on humanity, feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-worth – and, being something like 25 years younger, coming at them from a different point of view.</p>
<p>I find this record fascinating, and this band very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘Going to a Place’ sounds like Keane got trapped in another dimension and sent a cry for help… and then it completely switches up half-way through and becomes something transportive.</p>
<h3 id="1-jay-som--everybody-works">1. Jay Som — <em>Everybody Works</em></h3>
<p>Not infrequently it still amazes me what can come out of one person’s bedroom. Speaking personally for a moment, as someone who has spent the past year coming to terms with their own artistic limitations, it’s nothing short of astounding to me that one person, skilled in the use of the tools of a craft, can bring something as beautiful as <em>Everybody Works</em> forth from nothing.</p>
<p>I could list some presumed influences on this record (shoegaze &amp; post-rock for example) but there’s at least a half-dozen distinct genres in the blend here. The result is an album that feels truly singular and of a piece to me: a 36 minute work of artistic expression, filled with human warmth, colour, and feeling.</p>
<p>Highlight: ‘One More Time, Please’ is a perfect microcosm of the record in some respects. A disarming vocal, shining keys, and subtle low-key percussion, which all builds to a crescendoing guitar solo. Every note of every instrument performed by a 22 year old in her bedroom, sending something remarkable out into the world.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2017/06/06/who-goes-nazi.html">&#39;Who Goes Nazi?&#39; — Dorothy Thompson (1941)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2017/06/06/who-goes-nazi.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-06-05 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Jun 5, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently I was tipped to an excellent essay from a 1941 issue of <em>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</em>: <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/">&lsquo;Who Goes Nazi?'</a> by Dorothy Thompson. By way of imagining a series of guests at a dinner, Thompson interrogates the traits that incline someone towards fascism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His code is not his own; it is that of his class—no worse, no better, He fits easily into whatever pattern is successful. That is his sole measure of value—success. Nazism as a minority movement would not attract him. As a movement likely to attain power, it would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cumulative effect of the essay&rsquo;s construction is impressive; it&rsquo;s a brilliant piece of social anthropology, and perhaps even more so considering when it was written and published.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kind, good, happy, gentlemanly, secure people never go Nazi. They may be the gentle philosopher whose name is in the Blue Book, or Bill from City College to whom democracy gave a chance to design airplanes—you’ll never make Nazis out of them. But the frustrated and humiliated intellectual, the rich and scared speculator, the spoiled son, the labor tyrant, the fellow who has achieved success by smelling out the wind of success—they would all go Nazi in a crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the modern political climate of emboldened, far-right / alt-right nationalism it&rsquo;s impossible to <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/">read the piece</a> and <em>not</em> mentally extrapolate Thompson&rsquo;s exercise into our current circumstance.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2017/06/06/moderation.html">Moderation</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2017/06/06/moderation.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-06-05 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Jun 5, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Possibly in light of the weaponising of fake news during the 2016 American presidential election, and the increasing frequency with which acts of violence are being livestreamed, the debate around methods of moderation on the internet has seemingly heated up again. The crux of the problem is that more content is uploaded to popular platforms every minute than can be screened by even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/facebook-to-hire-3000-to-review-posts-with-hate-speech-crimes-and-other-harming-posts/">an army of human moderators</a>, and the algorithms aren&rsquo;t yet capable of parsing the nuances in text (let alone images or video) that would be required for them to make determinations on context, intent, and suitability. Add in the <em>The Guardian&rsquo;s</em> recent reporting on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/facebook-files">Facebook&rsquo;s policies for its human moderators</a>, and the problem seems ever more intractable. On the flipside, I&rsquo;m noticing the case being made more frequently that the seeming necessity of turning over more control to algorithms is in fact actively worsening the standard of content and the experience of internet use. In his recent talk at re:publica &lsquo;17 in Berlin (titled <a href="https://youtu.be/rSrLjb3k1II">&lsquo;Notes from an Emergency&rsquo;</a>) Maciej Ceglowski phrased it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The danger facing us is not Orwell, but Huxley. The combo of data collection and machine learning is too good at catering to human nature, seducing us and appealing to our worst instincts. We have to put controls on it. The algorithms are amoral; to make them behave morally will require active intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggestion, that the algorithms are exacerbating the problem rather than assisting in eliminating it, is also echoed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html">this recent piece on Ev Williams</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trouble with the internet, Mr. Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you’re driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behavior like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="20-deftones--gore">20. Deftones — <em>Gore</em></h3>
<p>Deftones topped 2012’s List with <em>Koi No Yokan</em> after a stretch of three albums in ten years that
didn&rsquo;t live up to the promise of 2000’s career-defining <em>White Pony</em>. Four years
later I’m happy to find <em>Gore</em> again hitting all of the right notes and innovating a
little further sonically to keep them where they belong (as pretty much the
only heavy rock act I pay attention to any more). <em>Gore</em> is the first album to be
released since the death of original bassist Chi Cheng in 2013 (following the
car crash in 2008 that left him in a coma). As such it is necessarily coloured
(particularly lyrically) by Chino Moreno dealing with the final loss of his friend
and bandmate. As with much of Deftones’ previous work, there is an expert
blending of darkness &amp; anger with lighter, more emotionally nuanced
elements that allow the band to access a lot of places that other acts in the
same space can&rsquo;t or don’t. There’s a finesse to their art, with Moreno’s voice
still setting the tone, and the instrumentation as adept as ever in supporting
the emotional direction(s) of the songs.</p>
<p>Following Cheng’s death there has been talk of releasing the now legendary
<em>Eros</em>, the album that was near-complete at the time of his accident. It would
be very interesting to know what a Deftones album recorded in 2008 would
sound like were it released now. As it is, I’m just happy that the band are still
making new music of this standard.</p>
<h3 id="19-honeyblood--babes-never-die">19. Honeyblood — <em>Babes Never Die</em></h3>
<p>After a swelling intro, the title track establishes quickly exactly what kind of
record Honeyblood have made: post-bubblegum garage pop, and throughout
a dozen tracks it’s delivered here in excellent form. Album high-point ‘Ready
for the Magic’ has detuned bass, handclaps, and a chorus to die for or dance
to (take your pick). There are a couple of down-tempo moments (such as the
Melvins-meet-Breeders dirge of ‘Love is a Disease’), but the main vibe is a
kind of slant coyness, showcased in various attitudes from the sweeping
‘Gangs’ to the low thrum of ‘Walking at Midnight’. Honeyblood know how to
craft a bridge, and at 39 minutes they also know how to get in and get out
having delivered a few body blows.</p>
<h3 id="18-chance-the-rapper--coloring-book">18. Chance the Rapper — <em>Coloring Book</em></h3>
<p>Spoilers: you’re not going to find Kanye West’s <em>The Life of Pablo</em> on this list. That
record is overly long, very self-indulgent (as you might expect), occasionally
transcendently masterful, but often frustratingly pedestrian or confused. As
events surrounding its release may have hinted, and events since have
confirmed, Kanye isn’t in a great place right now, and personally I think that
contributed to <em>…Pablo</em> being a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>Chance’s <em>Coloring Book</em> is the record I wish Kanye still feels he could make.
It’s the record that <em>Late Registration</em>-era Kanye could have put together in two
weeks, but its relaxed attitude, sunny vibes, and good humour now seem
(temporarily at least) beyond Chicago’s first son of rap; that baton has been
passed, and Chance is running with it. Perhaps ironically it picks up precisely
where Chance’s contribution to Kanye’s best track of 2016 — ‘Ultralight
Beam’ — left off, and from there it soars through bouncy floor-fillers and
relaxed summer jams, rarely pausing to take a breath. With ‘Blessings’
Chance has fashioned perhaps what amounts to a sonic calling card: humble,
not overworked, relaxed, and fairly glowing right out the speakers.</p>
<h3 id="17-thao--the-get-down-stay-down--a-man-alive">17. Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down — <em>A Man Alive</em></h3>
<p>30 seconds or so into album opener ‘Astonished Man’ one thinks ‘this sounds
kinda like tUnE-yArDs’, and one is not wrong: produced by Merrill Garbus,
this set of quirky dark-pop belays her ear for space and gain, for fuzz and
weird editing choices and for simple, driving percussion that holds down
something otherwise less grounded. (‘Astonished Man’ was also the subject
of an excellent <a href="http://songexploder.net/thao">episode of Song Exploder</a> this year, which reveals the song’s
deeply-personal roots.) Thao’s voice is an instrument perfectly-suited to
switching from conversational to plaintive to innocent and sing-songy. It’s in
particularly good form somersaulting all over the Pixies-ish ‘The Evening’,
which just about loses out on album-highlight honours in favour of the catchy
moodswing of ‘Nobody Dies’, which is possessed of the kind of chorus you’ll
sing the first time, hum for days, and then just bellow out the next time you
hear it. Every part of the band gets a moment to shine on <em>A Man Alive</em>, but I
found that my favourite moments were often the Regina Spektor-esque
confessional moments, such as on ‘Guts’ (the second-best song with that title
in 2016). Come for the pop, stay for the barrage of interesting ideas and left-
of-centre hooks. </p>
<h3 id="16-beyonce--lemonade">16. Beyonce — <em>Lemonade</em></h3>
<p>To this point Beyonce hasn’t been an album artist for me. There have been a
handful of singles through the years that have lit up my radar and caught in
my mind, but it hasn’t been enough to convince me to spend an hour with her
music. The 65 minute music video that accompanied the release of
<em>Lemonade</em> was more than enough to change my mind: beautiful, inventive,
and extraordinarily accomplished, the first watch of that film remains one of
my cultural high-points of 2016. It also serves as an excellent showcase of
what a diverse collection of music is to be found on the album itself. Hip-hop,
R&amp;B, soul-flavours, a little country on ‘Daddy Lessons’, a pure-bred ballad
like ‘Sandcastles’, whatever garage rock-vibed thing Jack White’s helping bring
forth on ‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’&hellip; there’s a lot here. And it’s all delivered with
energy to spare and immaculately produced. There’s also the much-
publicised matter of the album’s central subject: her husband’s infidelity. It’s a
theme that provides the emotional fuel for all of the music here, and keeps
it feeling honest, and it’s also the joining thread that runs through what
otherwise may have felt like a disparate collection of tracks. It should also be
noted that ‘Freedom’ is top 5 songs of the year material, and felt increasingly
prophetic and necessary as 2016 wore on.</p>
<h3 id="15-olafur-arnalds--nils-frahm--trance-frendz">15. Olafur Arnalds &amp; Nils Frahm — <em>Trance Frendz</em></h3>
<p>Arnalds’s solo record <em>&hellip;And They Have Escaped
the Weight of Darkness</em> places 12th on my List in 2010, and represents both my serious
introduction to his work and the reason I’ve followed him since. Nils Frahm
took a deserved 12th spot with <em>Solo</em> last year (a record given some new life
this year by the release of a kind of director’s cut edition: <em>Solo Remains</em>).
Their working together is the kind of partnership that seems so inevitable that
it must surely have been a case of when as opposed to whether. Pleasingly,
the fruits of the partnership, whilst familiar-sounding, are different enough that
they seem unlikely to have ever emerged from one or other of the artists
alone. Spare and delicate in composition as they both are they have taken
obvious care not to do too much here, and to facilitate one another where it
would have been easy for toes to be trodden upon. An ill-fitting title (it would
have been incredible if they’d made a trance record though), inscrutable track
names, and an album cover that looks like something they decided wasn’t
quite interesting enough to go on Instagram, is all par for the course, and all
meaningless once ‘20:17’ begins and you can forget everything else in the
world for three-quarters of an hour. Beautiful stuff.</p>
<h3 id="14-flume--skin">14. Flume — <em>Skin</em></h3>
<p>The last few years I’ve seemingly latched on to at least one album of bright,
warm electronica that stays on heavy rotation for months. Fort Romeau’s
<em>Insides</em> played the role last year, and it was SBTRKT’s sublime <em>Wonder
Where We&rsquo;ll Land</em> in 2014; this year the task falls to <em>Flume</em>. Similarly to that
SBTRKT record this is a set of songs that benefit from a host of guest
vocalists lending distinct flavours to a number of tracks throughout, but it’s all
underpinned with the a softly undulating blanket of pastel-coloured warmth
that ebbs and flows to its own hypnotising rhythm. Album-opener ‘Helix’
crests with a minute to go, and sets the relaxed tempo, then picked up by
highlight track ‘Never Be Like You’. Raekwon makes a notable appearance,
and the record closes on a mellow high with Beck lending vocals to ‘Tiny
Cities’, but what kept this playing for me was the soundscape that Flume
conjures throughout.</p>
<h3 id="13-submerse--awake">13. Submerse — <em>Awake</em></h3>
<p>Submerse took 5th spot in 2014 with the wonderful <em>Slow Waves</em>, and whilst I
enjoyed the follow-up (2015’s <em>Stay Home</em>) it just missed out on last year’s list.
<em>Awake</em> finds Submerse back on The List and further securing his place as
one of my desert island artists. Ethereal opener &lsquo;Too Late, They’re Already
Here’ is transportive, and gives way to perhaps my favourite Submerse track,
‘Sidequests’: a shimmering pool of muted pops, shining chimes, and a mellow
synth are met by a minimal refrain in a climbing register. Like many of his
tracks, it blends the electronic and the acoustic seamlessly into something
unique-feeling and oddly alive. I listened to this set of tracks dozens of times
this year and found new things on each play through. At this point it would be
a shock if the next Submerse release sounded dramatically different to this,
since his recent output is all quite similar, but I’m excited for it regardless.
This is a sonic space I&rsquo;ll happily return to time and time again.</p>
<h3 id="12-solange--a-seat-at-the-table">12. Solange — <em>A Seat at the Table</em></h3>
<p>Here’s something I’ve struggled with a bit this year: a prevailing sense that
some of the music I got the most enjoyment from is not intended for me.
Whilst sensitive to cultural heritage I’m not a believer that such broad
distinctions as ‘white music’ and ‘black music’ exist; I don’t subscribe to the
reductive idea that entire genres of music are the province of one set of
people or another. However, when an album like <em>A Seat at the Table</em> comes
along, and speaks in large part about the black experience, there’s a reflexive
guilt and fear of cultural appropriation that rises in me at claiming it as one of
my favourite albums of the year. Oddly, this isn’t something that seems to
translate to other media: I have no problem saying that Ta-Nehisi Coates’s
<em>Between the World and Me</em> was one of the very best books I read this year, or
that <em>The Get Down</em> and <em>Atlanta</em> were two of my favourite TV shows of 2016 -
all exemplary pieces of art that deal directly, primarily with black cultural
history. Still, in the final analysis it would be disingenuous of me to leave
Solange off this list. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is a collection of beautifully crafted,
soul-infused R&amp;B songs that mix the deeply personal with insightful social
commentary like few records I’ve heard the last couple of years. It is bold and
vital, and despite all the ways in which it’s not for me it gave me too much not
to recognise the important role it played in my listening in 2016.</p>
<h3 id="11-angel-olsen--my-woman">11. Angel Olsen — <em>MY WOMAN</em></h3>
<p>What drew me to the (obligatorily fully capped-up) MY WOMAN in the first
place was catching the track ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ being played on Beats1. Had
the album been a wash that still would have been fine, since that one track — with it’s endearing mix of bokeh warmth and aching longing — ended up being
probably my favourite song of 2016. Fortunately there are plenty of other
treats in store on an album that puts garage pop-rock through its paces,
whilst bending it to all of its intended purposes: exciting, yearning,
commiserating, celebrating, and the painting of personal stories of loss and
misunderstanding in love. Olsen’s voice is the right balance between
emotionally affected and lackadaisical, and her guitar is usually found in a
similar (Ben Kweller-esque) attitude, moving between relaxed strum and
energised pounding of the three or four chords that make up each song.</p>
<p>This is an easygoing album full of memorable, hummable, sing-alongable
songs. It spawned a couple of the year’s stickiest tracks as far as my inner
ear was concerned, with ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ not the only song from the
collection that continued spinning ad infinitum in my mind. (PS The roller-skating video to that song is also a lot of fun.)</p>
<h3 id="10-ryo-fukui--mellow-dream">10. Ryo Fukui — <em>Mellow Dream</em></h3>
<p>I listened to a bit more jazz this year than has been the case the last couple,
and whilst there have been a few records I’ve enjoyed (shouts to Takuya
Kuroda’s <em>Zigzagger</em> and Shabaka &amp; the Ancestors’ <em>Wisdom of Elders</em>) only
one really got its hooks into me in a serious must-play-every-other-day kind of
way. <em>Mellow Dream</em> is aptly titled, and I never got tired of closing my eyes and
revisiting Fukui’s lively, colourful compositions. Some of the absolute best,
most energetic and surprising piano playing I’ve heard in years over the top of
a bass and percussion line that always knows just what’s required to keep
each piece flowing. The title track / opener and follow-up ‘My Foolish Heart’
are light and breezy, where ‘Baron Potato Blues’ has a bit more of a swagger,
and the closing rendition of ‘My Funny Valentine’ is a little sad and demure. Throughout it’s impossible not to be impressed by Fukui’s playing, but taken holistically the
album is an equally impressive achievement.</p>
<h3 id="9-gold-panda--good-luck-and-do-your-best">9. Gold Panda — <em>Good Luck and Do Your Best</em></h3>
<p>The charming friendliness of this album’s title is carried over into its
welcoming ambience. Though occasionally employing some harder edges
(such as on the haunting ‘Song for a Dead Friend’), the album’s overall vibe is
of easygoing acceptance. Acoustic instruments layer upon drum patterns and
sparingly-employed synth to make beautiful sculptures of sound like the
meditative and hypnotic ‘Time Eater’, and the resigned, good-natured
‘Autumn Fall’. At the album’s centre is a track called ‘I Am Real Punk’ which
despite its title displays a kind of measured grace; its a microcosm of this self-
assured, slightly odd collection of electronica.</p>
<h3 id="8-lone--levitate">8. Lone — <em>Levitate</em></h3>
<p>I find it difficult to believe now that Lone’s 2014 record <em>Reality Testing</em> didn&rsquo;t
make my top 20 for that year, but there you go: times change. Much like on
that record <em>Lone</em> has here put together a dazzling set of breakbeats over and
through which he weaves hard-edged synth in deeply rhythmic patterns. Very
few tracks swung harder for me this year than ‘Backtail Was Heavy’, and it
has a couple of nice counterpoints here in the frenetic ‘Triple Helix’ and the
slowly imploding ‘Sleepwalkers’. Levitate is a record that finds that sweet
spot: at 34 minutes (good portions of which push the BPMs) it doesn’t outstay
its welcome, but it also never runs out of ideas. As the closing moments of
‘Hiraeth’ ebb away I almost always wanted to loop back to the start and take
the journey again.</p>
<h3 id="7-holy-fuck--congrats">7. Holy Fuck — <em>Congrats</em></h3>
<p>Holy Fuck are one of those bands that I’ve been hearing about for years, and
have never taken the time to get to know. When I finally saw too many
recommendations for <em>Congrats</em> to ignore, and tuned in, I was immediately
glad that I did. For one thing — speaking a bit reductively — in a year with no
Liars LP and no Battles LP this helped fill a requirement for a particular type
of over-energised, spiralling, de-tuned noise. Taken on its own merits though
(as it should be) <em>Congrats</em> is raucous, sonically all-encompassing, and
endlessly inventive: it keeps you off balance throughout in the same way the
better Mars Volta records do. Album high point ‘House of Glass’ takes turns at
being punishing, then jaunty, then punishing again as it unleashes a central
bass-heavy refrain that sounds like a heart attack. There are certainly subtler
moments, such as on the interlude ‘Shimmering’ and the rather poppier ‘Neon
Dad’, but this isn’t pretending to be a pop album. It’s an odd thing, which
challenges you to wrestle with it and in doing so dig out some hidden
treasures. It’s well worth the effort.</p>
<h3 id="6-tegan--sara--love-you-to-death">6. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Love You To Death</em></h3>
<p>A new T&amp;S album will likely always remain a landmark release for me purely
on the strength of 2004’s near-flawless <em>So Jealous</em>. But it would be wrong to
think of the Quins as still riding the wake of one great album as they’ve
consistently found ways to experiment with their own sound in new and
impressive ways. <em>The Con</em> (2007) managed to find a way out of <em>So Jealous’s</em>
shadow by virtue of being odder, exhibiting rougher textures and sharper
angles; <em>Sainthood</em> in 2009 took a larger step towards synth-based
compositions, and <em>Heartthrob</em> doubled down on that in 2013. If anything I feel
like I was a little behind the curve on those last two records, feeling a little
disappointed by them in the first instance before being won over by their
infectious charms. I felt more prepared for <em>Love You To Death</em>, and sure
enough I was on board from Music’s first plays of ‘Boyfriend’, ‘100x’ and
personal favourite ‘Stop Desire’ that preceded the albums release. 32
minutes, 10 tracks, not a bad one in sight (despite some occasionally
questionable half-rhyme lyrics here and there) and this record takes its place
amongst my top 5 Tegan &amp; Sara albums. It’s testament to their enduring
excellence that that is rare company to be in. </p>
<h3 id="5-explosions-in-the-sky--the-wilderness">5. Explosions in the Sky — <em>The Wilderness</em></h3>
<p>The short way to encapsulate how I feel about <em>The Wilderness</em> is to say that
it’s EitS’s best LP since 2003’s <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em>, which
pretty much defined my personal understanding of post-rock. They’ve made
very good albums since, but this is the first to light up my synapses like the
album that introduced me to them. Built largely of the same stuff as previous
albums — percussion that has the force of weather events, and great, snaking
rivers of melody carving through canyon walls of guitar — this record also finds
places to introduce some muted electronic elements; never in a way that
radically alters the band’s now-signature sound, but certainly in ways that
complement and tweak it in subtle ways, surely make long-term
listeners to EitS prick up their ears. My favourite of the record’s tracks is a
toss-up between the propulsive, evangelic currant of ‘Tangle Formations’, and
the darker, Basinski-referencing first single ‘Disintegration Anxiety’. Nothing
here is going to change anyone’s mind about the band (I wonder sometimes
whether their rapturous live show might have the power to do so), but it is a
welcome thing to find a band 17 years on from their formation still making
compelling music that is very much their own. </p>
<h3 id="4-bloc-party--hymns">4. Bloc Party — <em>Hymns</em></h3>
<p>In some respects the most quietly revolutionary album of 2016. After a four
year break following <em>Intimacy</em> it didn’t feel like a sure thing that we’d see
another Bloc Party album. And even after the successes of <em>Four</em> (2012) the
four year break that followed that album had a ring of finality about it.
In some bands (even four-pieces) it would be no big thing to replace the
drummer and bassist; not so with Bloc Party, where Matt Tong and Gordon
Moakes’s contributions were always beyond the average. Sure enough
<em>Hymns</em> isn’t showcase to the same kind of frenetic, self-perpetuating drum
patterns as previous of the band’s albums, and there are perhaps fewer truly
memorable bass lines. However, that is at least in part down to the way in
which the band’s sound has reconfigured itself here. The tempos are often
more forgiving (certainly than was the case on <em>Four</em>), there is greater
emphasis on Kele’s voice (with which he seems to feel increasingly
comfortable). What remains is songwriting split fairly evenly between
confessional and social commentary, and equally strong at each. But the
textures that are new to Bloc Party offer an opportunity to reach into new
spaces: the unsettled oddness of ‘Different Drugs’; the romantic swell of ‘My
True Name’ undercut by a haunting choral vocal; the proto-gospel euphoria of
‘Only He Can Heal Me’, which takes its place amongst the band’s best tracks.
I remain happy just to have this band around, I’m always excited to see what
Bloc Party do next, and for the first time I don’t really have a good idea what it
might sound like. </p>
<h3 id="3-elohim--elohim">3. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>
<p>Elohim was the discovery of 2016 for me, and several months on this record
remains just as alluring and confounding as when I first ran across it. Opener
‘Sensations’ is all you need in order to know whether this will be a record for
you; it hooked me after a single verse and chorus and hasn’t let go since.
Poppier than Bat for Lashes and less angular than Grimes, this is still
defiantly odd alt-pop music and with a dark edge that’s reflected in the
performer’s penchant for wearing masks onstage and in her videos. (It’s
worth mentioning that one of Elohim’s strongest tracks from 2016 —’Hallucinations’ —isn’t on this album, but was released on a subsequent EP
and is also accompanied by perhaps my favourite (single-track) music video
of the year.) ‘She Talks Too Much’ is winking and a little giddy; ‘Xanax’ is aptly
washed out and dreamlike, and feature’s one of 2016’s most memorable
refrains (“every day of my day of my day of my life”); ‘Guts’, though, squeaks
into the album-highlight spot by somehow channeling both Robyn and Jim
Guthrie. Singular but all the more magnetic for it, I couldn’t get enough of this. </p>
<h3 id="2-rihanna--anti">2. Rihanna — <em>ANTI</em></h3>
<p>As I wrote above in relation to Beyoncé, despite a set of jewel-perfect singles
I had not previously thought of Rihanna as an album artist. Like the rest of the
world then (if for different reasons), I wasn’t prepared for <em>ANTI</em>. Long in
coming though it has been, when the album finally arrived at the tail end of
the kind of wilfully obfuscatory social-media marketing campaign that is
seemingly now de rigueur (see also <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, <em>Views</em>, <em>Lemonade</em>,
<em>Blond(e)</em>) the reaction from music press and listening public alike was a near-
universal: ‘wha?’. I lost track of the number of times people pointed out there
was no ‘Umbrella’ here, no ‘Take a Bow’ or ‘Only Girl’, as though a pop artist
is expected to work to a quota of one banger per x number of other songs,
with which they can do what they like. On <em>ANTI</em> Rihanna is plainly not
interested in working to the one-for-me-one-for-the-dancefloor model. Instead
she’s happy to be flirtatious and demanding on ‘Work’, coy on ‘Kiss it Better’,
and somewhat terrifying on ‘Needed Me’, all the while delivering flawless
vocal performances (seriously, ‘Higher’ alone remains near-unbelievable after
100+ listens) over the top of immaculate, captivating beats. If you need
something else you can go listen to those Calvin Harris tracks that she makes
into pop masterpieces just by showing up. I’ll be here swaying to ‘Love on the
Brain’ or crying to ‘Close to You’. </p>
<h3 id="1-radiohead--a-moon-shaped-pool">1. Radiohead — <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em></h3>
<p>I honestly don’t know where to start when talking about Radiohead. Perhaps
it’s enough to say that I’ve been on a quest for about 10 years to find anyone
who makes music that sounds anything like theirs, and I haven’t come up with
anything. Radiohead, at this point, is a one-band genre, but one that shifts
and re-colours itself to always remain stunningly relevant and new-seeming.
<em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em> isn’t so much an album of music as it is the latest
dispatch in the cataloguing of the British liberal psyche: this is who we are at
the moment, and how we feel, it seems to say. Still concerned about our
lonelinesses and our failures, still preoccupied with finding a place in the
world, but also increasingly overwhelmed by larger events, and frightened by
the evanescence of hope.</p>
<p>Arcade Fire do voice and hope, and are similarly documentarian; Liars do
complex and dense layers of confused feeling; Sigur Ros do rapture;
Explosions in the Sky do overwhelm and exorcism… only Radiohead
consistently find a way to put all of those components together, and always in
beautiful new ways that continue to awe me. We’re so very lucky to have
them.</p>

			 <p>Michael Ondaatje’s novel <em>In The Skin of a Lion</em> (1987) is full of exquisite detail, used in bringing to life some beautifully crafted characters and extraordinary events. It’s a book that moves from a brilliantly rendered Canadian river to a palatial waterworks plant via a stolen yacht, a mushroom factory, a prison and a house aflame. Ondaatje’s command of language is absolute; no matter how unlikely the situation he does not fall into cartoonishness, and even though some of his more colourful characters risk caricature, he expertly keeps them from crossing that line. And yet for all this, the one sentence of the novel that caught me most off guard is simple and declarative, possessed of some less ornate form of the magic the author uses elsewhere. I stopped, copied the sentence out onto a notepad and stared at it for a while.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The waitress with the tattoo gave him his coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was it about these nine words that had stopped me in my tracks? My immediate impression of the sentence was of its crystalline clarity; it gives the reader an action perfectly, and more than that it gives us a scene. We have been introduced to this waitress a couple of chapters before. She was the subject of four paragraphs in which Ondaatje gives us his protagonist’s impressions of her: she is silent, adept at her job, complete in and of herself, and harmoniously integrated with her workplace. She is the subject of Patrick’s somewhat melancholy attention only briefly on the page, though she represents something important to him: a part of his routine. The waitress’s constancy is reassuring to Patrick amid the absences and uncertainties elsewhere in his life. Her tattoo is mentioned only briefly, its primary purpose here being to serve as a hint of personal detail, enough to allow for the possibility that away from the Thompson Grill she leads a rich, unknowable life.</p>
<p>All that is required for Ondaatje to reprise those feelings a dozen pages later is the presence of this detail. He includes mention of the tattoo in the waitress’s one sentence appearance and all of Patrick’s feelings about what she represents arise again in the reader’s mind. It is a powerful trick that works so subtly in bringing extra colour to the later passage that the reader may not even be aware of it.</p>
<p>As well as performing this tonal function the sentence is also appealing because it&rsquo;s structurally immaculate. There are the paired Ws of ‘waitress’ and ‘with’, neatly mirrored by the symmetrically placed paired Hs of ‘him’ and ‘his’. Then there is the cute match of paired consonants and paired vowels that occurs in both ‘tattoo’ and ‘coffee’. It looks great on the page, and gives the reader the little thrill of that elongated vowel sound at the middle and end of the sentence: ‘oo’, ‘ee’.</p>
<p>And what about that word ‘tattoo’? It’s the most unusual of the nine; the most exotic sounding; the most unlikely: just three Ts and a couple of vowels. Ondaatje has placed it dead center in terms of both word and syllable count, lending it a nice primacy. As it completes the description of the waitress it also marks a natural pause when read, separating the sentence into two pieces of seven and five syllables respectively. Coupled with this, the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable of each of the disyllabic words and that they are preceded by one, two and three monosyllabic words respectively, gives the sentence real rhythm. The staccato triplet of ‘gave him his’ after the natural pause propels the reader towards the end of the sentence and that second elongated vowel sound.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful, poetic writing: a simple, finely crafted piece of description that has emotional colour to it and is rhythmically pleasing to the reader’s mind.</p>

			 <p>This book, which takes the form of an open letter from author Ta-Nehisi Coates to his young son, is without equivocation the most beautifully written non-fiction work I’ve read in a decade. Unfailingly insightful in its dissection of troubling facts, as well as in the explication of the depth of feeling experienced as a direct result of those same facts, Coates’s voice presents hard emotional truths with peerless clarity and directness.</p>
<p>Much of the power of the work is derived from the author’s ability to find a way of viewing the universal through the lens of the intensely personal. The bridging of this dichotomy is exemplified in the fact that the text’s argument is centred not on something as intangible as the concept of &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo; but on the more concrete half of the <em>habeas corpus</em> equation: the body. Coates returns time and again to the effects upon the black body of the rules, systems, histories, and environments he examines. No injustice is so abstract that it cannot be characterised—at least partially—by way of its effects upon the body. And no system can remain entirely impersonal when it is considered in relation to its effects upon the person.</p>
<p>Coates' interrogation succeeds primarily in the building of his argument fourth-dimensionally: the construction of a palimpsest which brings into focus the contemporary results of historic injustices. He calls out causal connections where they are too often forgotten or denied, and instructs the reader in the re-framing of slavery not as a discrete period of the American story but as part of a multi-generational and multi-national narrative; part of the narrative of capitalism; part of the narrative of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; in the first world; a colossal human endeavour with real and lasting effects in the present day. Here too Coates takes on the task of navigating between talk of people and talk of institutions. His gift is in relating one to the other: a conglomerate nothing more than an amalgamation of numerous individuals; individuals peculiarly susceptible to the unique power of collectives, and both in thrall to their inheritance of history&rsquo;s lessons and codes.</p>
<p>That Coates has chosen to write this letter to his son as an open one is a gift to us; it’s our privilege to read it. I could not help but read it partly as a continuation of the autobiographical project in the vein of <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</em> (1845) and Richard Wright&rsquo;s <em>Black Boy</em> (1945) (with which it shares interesting considerations of the authors’ contemporary Chicago, and of their atheism). However, there is something immediate and important in reading a record of one’s own time and recognising in it the truth of the injustices of which it speaks.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-the-necks--vertigo">20. The Necks — <em>Vertigo</em></h3>
<p>Kicked off in 2006 when I fell hard for <em>Chemist</em>, and continuing through a dalliance with the peerless <em>Silverwater</em> (2009) as well as an <a href="/neckslive">unforgettable Barbican live performance</a>, my love affair with The Necks continues. There have been a few releases in between, but the 44 minutes of <em>Vertigo’s</em> single track have been the first to stick firmly in my mind and find me consistently playing a Necks release in a little while.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the band’s sound this is exactly what you’d expect, and if you’re not it’s very difficult to describe. The tags you’d apply to it—’improvised’ &amp; ‘jazz’ chief amongst them—are useful to a point, but not necessarily indicative of just how successfully this trio create a singular-feeling music: unrepeatable and yet entirely consistent in terms of the levels of interest and intrigue it sustains. All of which makes it even less palatable that I was in London on the final night of their Café Oto residency and did not manage to secure a ticket!</p>
<h3 id="19-battles--la-di-da-di">19. Battles — <em>La Di Da Di</em></h3>
<p>When the new Battles line-up dropped <em>Dross Glop</em> in 2012, five years on and one member down from the glorious debut <em>Mirrored</em> (2007) I was super-excited, and then — once the sugar rush had abated — a little disappointed with the result. The album had its moments, but the loss of Tyondai Braxton was notable (indeed, in retrospect, Braxton’s solo album <em>Central Market</em> (2009) was the stronger post-<em>Mirrored</em> output). It’s gratifying then to find Battles, a couple of years into the new lineup, genuinely returned to their full strength. Opener here ‘The Yabba’ (the track titles make as little sense as ever) is as strong as anything on the debut; both ‘Dot Net’ and ‘FF Bada’ repurpose drum patterns familiar from that first record but find new and inventive ways to use them - woven in with an instrumental palate that has the strange honour of now feeling totally familiar as well as distinctly off-kilter.</p>
<p>There’s certainly the odd moment when you wonder whether a line has been crossed (such as on the impenetrable opening minute of &lsquo;Tricentennial’) but those can be waived in light of how good it is to hear this band back to their endlessly inventive best.</p>
<h3 id="18-florence--the-machine--how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful">18. Florence + The Machine — <em>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</em></h3>
<p>I haven’t paid all that much attention to Florence Welch since debut album <em>Lungs</em> arrived alongside debuts from Little Boots &amp; La Roux in 2009. It was ‘Bulletproof’ &amp; ‘In For The Kill’ from the latter that stuck with me that year, and then all three artists kind of faded from view for me.</p>
<p>After an underwhelming return by La Roux last year, it comes as a welcome surprise that F+TM’s record really got to me this time around. I read a review at the time that pointed out the symbolic importance of Welch’s facing forward on the album cover for the first time. And indeed this does feel like a more directly addressed, more personal set of songs. Less obtuse, adorned with less in the way of theatrics, the record embraces naked emotionality as its throughline. There are certainly poetic flourishes to the lyrics, and the album isn’t without bombast (‘Queen of Peace’ rises and blooms like a firework display), but it feels somehow more personal than both the artist’s previous output and that of the majority of her contemporaries.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned also, that the 4-minute white rapids journey of opener ‘Ship to Wreck’ is quite possibly the best song I heard all year.</p>
<h3 id="17-squarepusher--damogen-furies">17. Squarepusher — <em>Damogen Furies</em></h3>
<p>Over a 20+ year career I’ve payed far too little attention to Squarepusher. The closest I got previously was a dip into 2010’s Shobaleader One: <em>d’Demonstrator</em> - itself a kind of spin-off album featuring an expanded lineup. <em>Damogen Furies</em> is my first exposure to Squarepusher-prime, and it’s left me a little shaken but thrilled and hungry for more. Comprising a host of somewhat raw-sounding electronica elements, settled in a bed of off-kilter, low wind instruments, or 16-bit era videogame chiptune soundscapes, the overall tone of the album is somewhere between menacing and schizophrenic — not dissimilar to Reznor’s OST for <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em>.</p>
<p>At its most frenetic the drum patterning walks a line between highly measured and almost-freeform jazz, ricocheting all over the map and pulling the melodies into any number of new, convoluted forms. (One of my favourite examples of this is once ‘Baltang Ort’ gets past the 4.30 mark and loses its composure a bit; that last minute is insane.) It’s a remarkable achievement to make something so mechanical seem at the same time organic - responsive to shifts in the music’s mood.</p>
<h3 id="16-will-butler--policy">16. Will Butler — <em>Policy</em></h3>
<p>Will Butler, here, has the same thing going for him as going against him: his membership of Arcade Fire. It’s doubtful — or at least significantly less likely — that I would have picked up this record without that background, and yet it comes freighted with a baggage that is entirely unfair. What Butler has produced is nothing more and nothing less than a collection of simple songs. Each one has an emotional directness familiar to listeners of his previous works, and they move between valences with aplomb. ‘Finish What I Started’ is a two-minute plea from the heart, and then it’s straight into ‘Son of God’: something close to an understated call for revolution.</p>
<p>There’s a smattering of multi-instrumentalism, but it sounds more like one man jumping from piano to keyboard to guitar, and less like the glorious, polychromatic racket that the collective of which he’s an integral part are capable of building. There’s also the nagging fact of how close Will’s voice is to that of brother Win. In a year without an Arcade Fire album this was a welcome dose of some watered-down substitute. That’s a very unfair thing to say about a pretty great album of alt-pop songs, but it was the feeling I couldn’t shake on the many occasions I listened to it. Sorry Will.</p>
<h3 id="15-wolf-alice--my-love-is-cool">15. Wolf Alice — <em>My Love is Cool</em></h3>
<p>The list of bands I listened to religiously in the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s that are obvious influences on Wolf Alice is long. And there’s no effort made to disguise that here, on an album that feels both a little familiar and oddly quaint in its delivery of a 20+ year old sound. Opener ‘Turn to Dust’ is as pretty as it is alluring, with just a hint of sadness enough to make you wonder what other colours the band will paint with. It’s the sort of effortless conjuring of mood that Laura Marling displayed time and again on her first couple of albums. When, after just over 3 minutes, the album shifts into ‘Bros’, the listener is assured that they’re in safe hands; I certainly didn’t hear a prettier straight-ahead, guitar-led pop song this year - so simple in its construction, yet executed beautifully enough to bring a tear to my eye on several listens.</p>
<p>I’m left with questions about what the future holds for Wolf Alice: another collection of easygoing pop-rock singalongs that risks diminishing returns, or the temptation to risk something that may be outside their comfort zone? For now though, we have a really solid debut that does one thing very well indeed.</p>
<h3 id="14-fort-romeau--insides">14. Fort Romeau — <em>Insides</em></h3>
<p>I’d made the decision before the start of the year to listen to every 2015 release that Ghostly International put out, so – even if this hadn’t come recommended by Kieran Hebden — I would have run across it eventually.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why the man behind Four Tet likes what fellow Brit Mike Greene is doing here: it occupies largely the same space as Hebden’s own <em>Rounds</em> (2003): a kind of warm, comfortable, trancelike feeling somewhere between early morning tiredness and lazy sunbeam comfort. There are denser moments, such as the bass-driven ‘All I Want’, but they are swells upon an otherwise even-tempered expanse of musical ocean.</p>
<p>(This ended up being my favourite eligible Ghostly release for the year, though Shigeto’s <em>Intermission</em> EP, would be way up there if it was a little longer than 6 tracks &amp; ~20 minutes.)</p>
<h3 id="13-ibeyi--ibeyi">13. Ibeyi — <em>Ibeyi</em></h3>
<p>The two voices at the heart of Ibeyi’s self-titled debut are almost indistinguishable, belonging as they do to twins: Naomi &amp; Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Both are light, playful, and soulful, painting flowing lines over beds of minimal piano and simple beats. At times they’re also haunting, used to great effect in mirroring or weaving in and out of each other, such as on album highlight ‘River’ where they hold a kind of conversation amid the waves of their own background harmonising.</p>
<p>It no doubt helps that I first heard this record when we were in Copenhagen in February, and it’s linked in my mind with a great week we spent out there. The album’s sonic warmth conjures for me, every time, the warmth of the apartment we were staying in, and to which we returned after days walking in biting cold.</p>
<h3 id="12-nils-frahm--solo">12. Nils Frahm — <em>Solo</em></h3>
<p>In much the same way that Ghostly International started to colonise great swathes of my listening time a couple of years ago, London-based label Erased Tapes have made a huge impact for me recently: I got a lot of listening out of Kiasmos’s self-titled LP last year; A Winged Victory for the Sullen provided me with an unforgettable live experience in a Danish church this February&hellip; and there’s another ET artist elsewhere on this list. Hence it’s fitting that I came to Frahm via labelmate Ólafur Arnalds, a kindred spirit and sometime collaborator (they put out an EP together this year actually, which — though ineligible for The List — is a recommended listen also).</p>
<p>In terms of the album itself — a collection of masterfully constructed piano pieces —there’s not too much to say. There is some variation: the slightness of ‘Chant’ and the swell of ‘Wall’, but the album is best considered of a piece, and the mood it evokes is singular. The <em>Pitchfork</em> review phrased it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[I]t’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, it was, easily. On several occasions this year it was precisely the record I needed, and to which I turned when nothing else would do.</p>
<h3 id="11-the-sidekicks--runners-in-the-nerved-world">11. The Sidekicks — <em>Runners in the Nerved World</em></h3>
<p>I’m not sure how I came to listen to this; a January release that has stuck around tenaciously to claim a spot on The List, and has done so by charm more than anything else. Touchstones here are bands like The Shins and Saves the Day, and this record firmly filled the same spot this year as Local Natives’ <em>Hummingbird</em> a couple of years ago: the best example that happened to cross into my awareness of a musical style far more prevalent on these lists in the early 2000s and appearing with increasing rarity since. Nevertheless this is the real thing and faithfully delivered. Steve Ciolek’s voice is an empathetic through-line with a range between falsetto fragility and convincing moments of emotional conviction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blissfield, MI’ is the record’s high point, though its driving bravado is something of an outlier on an album primarily comprising prettier pop-rock. The track also contains the album’s best lyric; the kind of glimpse into personal emotional-geography that late ‘90s / early ’00s emo at its best did so well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like how the Bulls felt in 1993<br>
I feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="10-shamir--ratchet">10. Shamir — <em>Ratchet</em></h3>
<p>Another debut album for The List, and another distinct vocal - Shamir Bailey’s performance is by turns fragile (in the manner of a Michael Jackson ballad), cocky, or occasionally fierce. Low-key opener ‘Vegas’ keys the listener into a couple of the record’s themes — sin, pleasure — but is quickly undercut in a piece of genius sequencing by ‘Make A Scene’: a none-more-pop chant littered with unidentifiable sound effects, something that sounds distinctly like cow-bell, and a vaulting laser effect that draws the listener’s ear up and over Bailey’s falsetto.</p>
<p>There are plenty of catchy — if insubstantial — pleasures on offer, but the best track on the album is inarguably ‘On The Regular’, also probably 2015’s most infectious song. Its blend of lightness, self-assurance, and touches of thematic darkness are a good microcosm of the album in general. In the final analysis though, it was Shamir’s ear for a hook and the wit of his lyrics that brought me back to this time and again.</p>
<h3 id="9-purity-ring--another-eternity">9. Purity Ring — <em>Another Eternity</em></h3>
<p>For whatever reason Purity Ring’s debut (<em>Shrines</em> (2012)) didn’t make it onto my radar, and my introduction to the band came when I asked Siri to identify a song which turned out to be ‘Bodyache’ in a coffee shop this summer. Not long after that I was hooked on an album delicately balancing bright, dense synths and a similarly-toned female vocal. There are a few rhythm &amp; blues touches here and there (the cadence of ‘Repetition’ for example), but it’s one influence among a spectrum, all blended here amongst warm synth-swaths to produce an album it’s easy to submerge yourself in and not want to emerge from.</p>
<p>There’s nothing even slightly revolutionary here, but it’s an album — like Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> (2012) and SBTRKT’s <em>Wonder Where We Land</em> (2014) — that builds a cohesive and vibrant world of sound that pulled me in and kept me entranced.</p>
<h3 id="8-jamie-xx--in-colour">8. Jamie xx — <em>In Colour</em></h3>
<p>There’s something very smart about Jamie xx’s marking this solo release by calling out in the title (and album cover) the contrast to The xx’s predominantly monochrome aesthetic. That relationship is carried through to the music also, with the record feeling more expansive, more energetic, and wider-ranging than the (superb) work Jamie’s put out alongside Romy Madley Croft &amp; Oliver Sim. Touching on the same positive-vibes club scene sound as Four Tet’s recent output, the record moves at a pace and imparts a real warmth without ever moving much beyond third gear.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Gosh’ is a cheeky statement of intent. ’Stranger in a Room’ is night-driving music; traffic-lights refracted through rain music - cool in tone and soporific. ‘Hold Tight’ is a helter-skelter, hypnotic headphone trip. ’Obvs’ even manages to make good use of one of my least-favourite instruments: the steel drum.</p>
<p>I got a real kick out of this collection of assorted brighter, club-electronica sounds, and it’s left me even more excited for a third LP from The xx in 2016.</p>
<h3 id="7-rival-consoles--howl">7. Rival Consoles — <em>Howl</em></h3>
<p>And here’s that other member of the Erased Tapes roster alluded to earlier. Ryan Lee West’s set of constantly shifting soundscapes put a spell on me this year. As with Squarepusher earlier in this list, this is electronic music engaged in the exploration of what happens when a pattern is disrupted, complicated, and altered. Not as fraught as the music on <em>Damogen Furies</em>, but just as restless, this is an album for headphones not just because of its density and intricacy, but also because of its propulsiveness. It’s music to walk to, run to, and ride rails to.</p>
<p>Each track is distinct, none outstay their welcome, and West knows when he’s stretched a beat to its breaking point, and thus when to move on. There’s a melancholy to some of the album’s lower tones, but elsewhere there’s a playfulness, and energy to spare (such as displayed by the shuffling brush-played drums underneath album highlight ‘Low’). Closing track ‘Looming’ is perhaps the collection’s tightest package; the euphoric shivers of synth that run through it ringing out like harbingers of a sunrise.</p>
<h3 id="6-nosaj-thing--fated">6. Nosaj Thing — <em>Fated</em></h3>
<p>There’s a tone and a tempo of electronica that I’ve been continuously hunting since Flying Lotus’s <em>Cosmogramma</em> put me under its spell in 2010. Shigeto’s <em>No Better Time Than Now</em> satisfied the itch in 2013, and last year the role was played by Submerse’s <em>Slow Waves</em>; in 2015 the honour goes to the third record by Jason Chung a.k.a. Nosaj Thing.</p>
<p>Laid back to the point of near-horizontality, and characterised by nothing so much as a pervading sense of warmth, this is a species of electronic music that finds soul and humanity within the machines - blood in the wires. If I could pick a record of 2015 to live inside, it might well be <em>Fated</em>. The cover image is a simple black &amp; white photo of Chung holding up a fork by the tines, a butter knife suspended from it at 6 o’clock, pulled by gravity and held by some quirk of magnetism. The album somehow feels the same: a long, suspended moment, slightly magical, in tune with chance. For whatever reason I think of this sub-category as liminal electronica - and, considering that that’s a musical genre that doesn’t exist outside of my head, Chung does a remarkable job of getting it just right.</p>
<h3 id="5-metric--pagans-in-vegas">5. Metric — <em>Pagans in Vegas</em></h3>
<p>This album’s a disappointment within the limited framework of comparison to its predecessor: the flawless <em>Synthetica</em> (2012). Still present are the sure-footedly executed balance of pop sensibilities and underlying electro menace, the flawless understanding of what a key-change or lyrical twist can accomplish, and the sense of a band exploring every corner of their alt-electro-synth-pop palate.</p>
<p>When the pace dipped I found myself losing interest just a little — something that never happened throughout <em>Synthetica</em> — and overall the quality is merely outstanding rather than genre-defining. There are exceptions: the effervescent ‘The Shade’, and the sly, shifting ’Cascades’ are every bit as good as I’d come to expect from Metric. In the final analysis this is a really solid continuation of the band’s sound, somewhat unfairly made to feel slight in comparison to a vastly superior previous album. And yet, these things must be put in context and this place in the top five is richly deserved.</p>
<h3 id="4-toro-y-moi--what-for">4. Toro y Moi — <em>What For?</em></h3>
<p>This is an album possessed of both a distinct sense of the mood it wants to invoke, and also a sense of humour about the single-mindedness with which it sets about the task. Smart, effortlessly cool, and rendered with a fresh clarity, the soul influences are worn as a badge of honour whilst the mismatch of laid-back delivery and sometimes heavier content is endlessly compelling.</p>
<p>The vocals are liberally treated with effects, but its done with such a holistic sense of the album’s sonic world that instead of risking distraction it instead echoes the warm distortion of the guitars, and serves to deepen the rich, swaying textures of the lower- tempo tracks. When the pace picks up on tracks like ‘Empty Nesters’ it takes the edge off the more cutting lyrics (“Call Mom &amp; Dad because their nest is empty, and so are you”) and keeps the mood light. Aaron Gold’s drums perform the same trick throughout, keeping things light and moving swiftly.</p>
<p>The record’s finest moment comes in the shape of ‘Spell It Out’: a three-minute sideswipe that comes off like a simultaneous slap and kiss to the cheek.</p>
<h3 id="3-grimes--art-angels">3. Grimes — <em>Art Angels</em></h3>
<p>Rumour has it that after the unexpected level of attention garnered by 2012’s <em>Visions</em>, Clare Boucher made an album’s worth of material — including ill-conceived single release ’Go’ — before scrapping the whole thing and starting again. If true it’s perhaps indicative of how seriously Boucher sees the task of representing herself truthfully through her art in the glare of intensified media interest.</p>
<p>She starts, simply, on the introductory ‘Laughing and Not Being Normal’, by reminding us that she has a spectacular voice, sometimes overlooked in commentary that focusses on her layering techniques and beat-making. From there she progresses into the achingly-beautiful ‘California’, which contains perhaps Grimes’s clearest method statement: &ldquo;I love this music / It sounds just like my soul&rdquo;. And so unfolds a record democratic in its tastes, eclectic in its tone and tempo, and yet singularly focussed on the task of pure artistic expression. Whatever reception the release received it seems clear that the most important thing to the artist here was making a record she was happy with. And so she indulges every whim for the duration that it retains her attention: sweetness, savagery, choral melody, multi-layered spiral-staircase beats&hellip; and on.</p>
<p>‘Kill V. Maim’ is the album’s centrepiece, a crucible for all this particularly brilliant form of compositional madness, and — by some miracle — one of the best synth-pop anthems since Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em> five years ago.</p>
<h3 id="2-sleater-kinney--no-cities-to-love">2. Sleater-Kinney — <em>No Cities to Love</em></h3>
<p>Where did this come from?</p>
<p>I had a slight familiarity with S-K’s previous album: <em>The Woods</em> (2005), but that was a decade ago, and prior to that — in the pre-streaming / pre-download era — they’d never really crossed my radar other than as mentions in articles analysing the impact of grunge, listed alongside Belly and Sonic Youth, and a dozen other bands I never really connected with for whatever reason. So it comes as something of a surprise that I fell so hard for this album, having tuned in after hearing it compared to Wild Flag’s 2011 debut. (It’s pretty funny how clearly I had that influence the wrong way around.)
Released not three weeks into the year it was immediately obvious that this album would stick around for a place on The List. ‘Price Tag’ might be the best opening track of any album this year, and like ‘Surface Envy’, ‘A New Wave’ and&hellip; well, most of the album, it’s a ~3-minute masterpiece of concentrated energy driving forward a smart lyric. This collection of songs is near bursting at the seams with ideas, energy and new directionality; it’s possible that after 10 years away the three members of Sleater-Kinney came back together with so many ideas that <em>No Cities to Love</em> represents the finest 10 tracks of dozens recorded. Whatever the case, they’ve produced a near-perfect rock album with just the right levels of enthusiasm, menace, sadness, and empowering anger. The title track deserves special mention for balancing these elements particularly flawlessly, whilst showcasing the poppy lightness that keeps the whole record effervescing.</p>
<h3 id="1-chvrches--every-open-eye">1. Chvrches — <em>Every Open Eye</em></h3>
<p>Chvrches’ debut album reached number 4 on my 2013 list and so it’s fitting that this record, which represents a simultaneous strengthening and deepening of their sound, claims a higher spot. In truth the top three here came together pretty late. With Sleater-Kinney having been in pole position since release in Jan, and the Grimes LP not arriving until fairly late in the year, there was a bunch of late-in-the-day shuffling going on.</p>
<p><em>The Bones of What You Believe</em> was one of those records that I loved but which left me with questions as to how it would be followed up. The answer Chvrches have elected to go with — perhaps wisely — is to double down on what they’re indisputably great at: a propulsive strain of synth-pop, underpinned by a strong rhythm section, and shot through with a hint of darkness. Lauren Mayberry’s voice remains the band’s secret weapon: sometimes fragile-seeming and bruised, it is uniquely suited to making anthemic vocals feel tender and personal. It is not Hayley Williams’s absolute siren of a vocal style, but matches it for its ability to make the synaptic connection between head and heart.</p>
<p>The album is near-flawless; even the questionable choice to leave vocals to Martin Doherty on &lsquo;High Enough to Carry You Over’ shifts the album temporarily into a slightly different tone, following which ‘Empty Threat’ (the record’s poppiest moment) feels something like the lifting of a headache or a low mood.</p>
<p>Perhaps the album’s signal moment comes just over two minutes into ‘Clearest Blue’, when the tender build-up crescendos into a euphoric dance beat. Somehow the fact that it resembles nothing more closely than The Pet Shop Boys does nothing to dilute the sheer joy of it.</p>
<p>It’s telling that album number two has pushed Chvrches straight to the top of my list of acts to see live ASAP. Bright, sweet, imbued with boundless energy, and yet knowing and highly polished, this record is a confection but one over which I carry no guilt for adoring.</p>

			 <p>Ahead of Monday’s likely announcement of a streaming music service from Apple, I went back to read <a href="http://macdailynews.com/2007/02/06/apple_ceo_steve_jobs_posts_rare_open_letter_thoughts_on_music/">Steve Jobs’s blogpost from 2007</a> on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DRM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the state of the digital music economy. Jobs writes clearly and his argument is sound, but his frustration is evident; the post is actually part attack on the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; record labels’ shortsightedness, and part lobbying effort toward openness.</p>
<p>What would Jobs have thought of the prospect of streaming music? It seems like a half-way house between siloed ecosystems and platform agnosticism: you get to listen to whatever you like, but you don’t own any of it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, as a consequence of which it’s easy to up sticks and move to a competitor without losing anything apart from some easily recreated playlists. It feels like a compromise, and one in which neither the artists nor the listeners truly win. The labels continue to profit though, and that’s ultimately what made streaming services inevitable and the eradication of DRM an improbability.</p>

			 <p>It’s over. After months of training, and 308 minutes of running (and a little walking) on the streets of London yesterday, the marathon is no longer a milestone I’m headed towards but an accomplishment I can look back on.</p>
<p>It turns out that the night before a marathon – especially, I presume, when it’s your first marathon – you don’t sleep very well. I was a mix of nerves and a little bit of excitement, but whereas Elizabeth said it felt as though she was on the verge of going on holiday, it felt to me as though I was ill prepared for an exam or job interview the next day.</p>
<p>All of the prep was done – clothes laid out, bags all packed – and it was just a matter of getting up early, showering, eating a carb-heavy breakfast of peanut butter on wholemeal toast, and then walking up to the train. From the station to the starting line there was a good atmosphere. Practically the only other people getting a train to London at 7:30am on a Sunday were either fellow runners or friends and family  accompanying them. Leaving the train at the other end we found ourselves walking amid a melange of people in running gear pinning numbers to themselves and attempting to shake out their nervous excitement.</p>
<p>Once I had some paracetamol in my system, ibuprofen gel on my knees, my knee support in place, and a little vaseline on my nipples… I felt kind of ready. Kind of.</p>
<p>The start was a burst of nerves and good feeling as the music swelled and the noise of the crowds started. And it didn’t ever stop. The whole way around there was hardly a stretch of 50m that didn’t have people cheering, applauding, and urging runners on for hours and hours - it was quite a feeling and made me want to do something equally supportive for competitors in a similarly tough event in the future. I lost count of the number of people holding out offered half oranges and even slices of pizza. Reading the signs, meeting the eyes of encouraging spectators, it all helped even if it was just by giving my mind something else to do.</p>
<p>I think my attitude going into the event would have been more positive if I hadn&rsquo;t failed to complete the three longest sessions prescribed in our training plan. As it was I literally didn’t know if I would be able to complete the course. That was what I found myself contending with about half way through. The toughest part was somewhere around 15 miles in: I started to feel nauseated, lightheaded as though I might pass out, and like running was the <em>absolute</em> last thing I wanted to be doing. I thought quite clearly at that point that not only didn’t I <em>want</em> to finish the marathon, but I <em>could&rsquo;nt</em> do it. I remember thinking what a shame it was that all of the training had been for nothing. That was the first point at which I stopped to walk for a minute, and I managed to talk myself around. I switched isotonic drinks for water to calm my stomach, and switched my music off for a bit as it felt weirdly as though I didn’t have the mental capacity to process lyrics and melody as well as concentrate on running.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know how I got through the next 4 or 5 miles. I remember hitting mile 18 knowing that was where Elizabeth&rsquo;s family were watching from, and I amused myself momentarily by thwanging my sweat-soaked hat at her brother as I passed. Then I just kept going… and kept going. I ran as much as I could, walked occasionally when I couldn’t, and rode the highs and lows. Somewhere around mile 21, after walking for a couple of minutes, Kanye West’s ‘Black Skinhead’ came on shuffle in my headphones and I set my fastest kilometre of the race. I don’t know the psychology behind that, but I recall being amazed that my legs were still physically capable of what they were doing as I zipped past dozens of other tired runners. I actually had to make an effort to ease up for fear that my knees would just suddenly give out - I remembered clearly how I’d felt after similarly thrashing out the final 2 miles of the <a href="/halfmarathon">Dartford half marathon</a> a few weeks before.</p>
<p>Another fortuitous musical moment came when My Chemical Romance’s ‘Bulletproof Heart’ began as I reached The Mall and entered the final 800m. It had been my unofficial anthem throughout the months of training, and I very nearly cried to hear it at that point. I stepped up the pace with a big grin when I wasn’t singing it to myself. The song ended with ~25m of the race to go, and I crossed the line to the opening strains of Elton John’s ‘I’m Still Standing’, which seemed appropriately joyful.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/78b8577dce.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The whole process of collecting medals, meeting up with Elizabeth, and getting the train home all happened in an achey kind of blur. Then we showered, ordered pizza, and collapsed into bed before 9pm.</p>
<p>It turns out the night after a marathon you don’t sleep so well. I couldn’t find a position where my legs didn’t throb and ache, and my heart was thrumming and racing, possibly from dehydration. There’s a lot of thinking to be done about whether I’d ever do that again, and it still seems foreign to be able to say that I’ve completed a marathon. But there it is. Along with my MA this will be one of the major things I remember when I look back at my early 30s.</p>

			 <p>My favourite album cover from a couple of years ago was for Shigeto’s <a href="https://ghostly.com/products/shigeto-no-better-time-than-now"><em>No Better Time Than Now</em></a> (2013): an abstract swath of neon colour descending to deep black via a middle third that appears liquid, almost swimming in front of your eyes. It’s the work of Michael Cina, an abstract artist (as well as a director, and typographer amongst other things) based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/9ab3ad572f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I started to seek out more of Cina’s work: other covers for artists on Ghostly International (eg. for <a href="https://ghostly.com/products/matthew-dear-beams">Matthew Dear’s <em>Beams</em></a> (2012)); the series of <a href="https://ghostly.com/products/free-dl-the-fox-is-black-collection">desktop wallpapers</a> he put together for the label; and his broader design work via his company <a href="https://cinaassociates.com">Cina Associates</a>. Cina’s became one of those names that once you’re looking out for it seems to pop up all over the place, mentioned by other artists whose work you admire, or dropped into an article associated with some cool project on the horizon.</p>
<p>An in depth <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/michael-cina">interview at The Great Discontent</a> last year revealed a lot about the breadth of Cina’s work—particularly with regard to typography—and also allowed a glimpse into his practice and his admirable work ethic, and sometime after reading that I joined up to the artist’s mailing list. And it was via the mailing list that I learned a little more about Cina’s process when it comes to making abstract work. When starting on something new he first makes a series of studies, testing colours, sketching ideas - as Cina puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies are smaller pieces that I create when I work. They are an integral part of my process. Sometimes they are just a sketch, sometimes an idea for a larger painting. Many of these have been sourced for larger works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a semi-regular basis Cina puts together a set of these studies and offers them for sale at a nominal price. I’d been watching the listings for a couple of months before I found a piece that grabbed me, but now I’m proud to say I own a unique piece of Michael Cina’s work: ‘SC 107’</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/cf9fcb7dff.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of the wide variety of works employing different styles &amp; techniques, ‘SC 107’ stood out to me for the simple reason that—whether I was correct or not—I immediately perceived that Cina had been sketching towards a human face. What caught my attention first was the eye just left of the image’s centre, and then another, smaller and too far offset from the other but there. A thin, rectangular nose doesn’t entirely match the position of either eye, and is too close to the beginnings of a lower lip. The pen marks themselves may not have been enough, but something about the colouration: a reddish shoulder and then a band of yellow moving up through the right side of the face keyed my eye into the image - made it solid for me.</p>
<p>It arrived this week and I couldn’t be happier with it. The next step is to find a frame that suits; in person the piece has subtle patches of translucency, and I’d like to find something that keeps that visible.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2015/03/30/dorthe-nors-minna.html">Dorthe Nors — Minna Needs Rehearsal Space (2013)</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="/uploads/2023/9fef7ea4de.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I haven’t read a lot of Nordic fiction, but having recently returned from a first trip to Denmark, encountering a review of this new volume of Dorthe Nors’s work, I felt compelled to check it out. The book Pushkin Press has put out is actually a combination of Nors’s 2008 short story collection—<em>Karate Chop</em>—and a newer work: 2013’s prose-poem / novella, <em>Minna Needs Rehearsal Space</em>. I chose to dive into the latter first because I was intrigued by the form, and I remained so throughout its 89 pages.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole the work is decidedly more prosaic than poetic, although Nors nevertheless displays an assured understanding of rhythm and pace. To construct a narrative from largely declarative sentences, none of them long enough to break over two lines, demands a kind of discipline. Perhaps unavoidably, because of how the eye is drawn and how the language flows, the piece is quite propulsive. Nors exacerbates that by choosing to repeatedly start successive sentences with the same word. But within these constraints, she displays a great deal of tonal diversity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One shouldn’t hurt others unnecessarily.
One should above all be kind.
Minna would rather not be anything but.
Minna’s hardly anything but.
The email thunders through the ether toward Karin.
<em>That’s as it should be</em>, thinks Minna.
The ether’s full of malicious messages.
The ether hums with break-ups and loss.
The ether is knives being thrown.
The ether is blood surging back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text moves from Minna’s point of view to comment on her inner monologue and shifts so often and so fluidly that it sometimes occupies a position not readily identifiable to the reader.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minna and Jette sit <em>sans camouflage</em> in the midst of it all.
Jette’s eyes are insistent.
Minna has a hard time relaxing.
The legs biking.
The arms warding off blows.
The body full of vim.
The soul supposed to sit still.
It ain’t easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read the bulk of <em>Minna Needs Rehearsal Space</em> in two large gulps. Partly because the text makes it so easy to slip into its stream and get pulled along, but also because it felt that at any one point I was learning something about the central character—either by revelation or inference—that reframed my understanding of the narrative, whilst drawing me forward to discover more. The writing is, in places, quite beautiful, and whilst it felt at the start that the odd format may be a distraction, that never proved to be the case; Nors’s economy of language always allowed the work’s ideas to shine all the more clearly, rather than diminishing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dad’s hand and Minna’s.
The blue delta of Dad’s hand.
The sea rises in Minna.
The sea finds fissures in Minna.
Minna’s leaky.
Minna opens her eyes and blinks.
The sea tricks slowly.
The sea reaches land.
The beads of gravel rattle.</p>

			 <p>The starting whistle for the 2015 London Marathon will blow at 10:10am on Sunday 26 April. Or it’s a gun they fire, or a klaxon that sounds, or someone drops a handkerchief… I’m not sure <em>how</em> it starts, but I know <em>when</em> it starts: precisely four weeks from the publication of this blogpost. And I also know this: I’ll be there, nervous, excited, the number <strong>4011</strong> pinned to my chest, ready to take on a new challenge.</p>
<p>Back in October I <a href="/200days">wrote about how and why I got into this</a> in the first place. With 28 days to go I’m posting this as a pretty naked appeal for your help. Training has been hard work, and the most important thing in pulling me through it has been the kindness and support of my girlfriend — also running her first marathon — and of my friends &amp; family. This is as good a place as any to say that there is no way I would have come this far without your encouragement, so thank you all.</p>
<p>We’re now in the home stretch, and I’m posting this as a reminder that when I lace up my shoes four Sundays from now I’m doing it partly for myself, yes, but also for two charities. <del>If you’d like to learn more and maybe help me help them, please click on over to the fundraising page</del>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update: link removed now that the event is over.]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Today we reached the end of week 11 of our training plan for this year’s London Marathon, and the order of the day was to go out and run a half marathon. Luckily, there was one being staged 30 minutes away, around the outskirts of Dartford. This was the 39th running of the Dartford Half Marathon, and the first year in which the event had been moved from its previous summer slot to a cooler time of year. This, and the fact that it now falls perfectly for those of us building up towards the big event in six weeks’ time, had swollen the number of participants to more than 600.</p>
<p>The Dartford course — a little research told me ahead of time — is regarded as one of the toughest in the country, with three or four sizeable hills, the steepest of which comes about 10 miles into the race. Still, I was looking forward to the event. The previous three Sundays in the training plan had been beyond half marathon distance, with last Sunday being an 18 mile stretch that I’d found pretty punishing. I’d been having problems first with my right ankle and then — perhaps owing to overcompensating — my left knee, but the shorter runs during this week hadn’t posed any problems, and I felt good about the prospects of doing 13.1 miles at the pace I was aiming for — despite the hills.</p>
<p>Yesterday, whilst doing a bit of final preparation — checking I had the details of the day straight in my mind etc. — I stumbled on an item in the FAQs that put a real kink in my race plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In view of a raised awareness of the threat to safety… runners should not wear personal stereo equipment during this race. [A]nyone wearing such devices during the event will be disqualified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been running for a little over three years and I don’t think I’ve ever gone out for longer than 30 minutes without some form of audio accompaniment: music, podcasts, or an audiobook on longer stints. For me this kind of companionship serves a couple of purposes: music is motivating and helps me keep a rhythm, and listening to conversational podcasts or (usually fiction) audiobooks gives me something to involve myself with mentally as the miles tick past. The most important function, however, is to stop me thinking too much about the run. I have a terrible habit, left to my own devices, of constantly calculating the time elapsed vs. the likely time remaining; the pace of the previous mile and the pace of the present one, how they compare and what overall time would result from carrying on at one pace or altering up or down a gear. The prospect of listening to myself think like this for something like 2.5 hours was exhausting in and of itself.</p>
<p>During the event however, there was something about running a route that was new to me (instead of my usual route, which I know very well), and being surrounded by other runners, which kept my mind occupied to some degree. There were still stretches, particularly in the latter half of the race when I found myself running alone for a while, that I caught myself doing the maths, but overall my mind felt relaxed and engaged.</p>
<p>I did find the endeavour of running an ostensibly competitive race to be a bit strange. I’ve never really enjoyed playing competitive sports, and find my personality much more suited to running as I have sold it to myself: as a solo exercise, where my past self is my only competition. There is, however, still room for that conception whilst running within the framework of an organised, competitive event. I enjoyed the camaraderie that many of the competitors showed toward one another, and the encouragement of the course marshals, but when it came down to it I was by myself out there and had only myself to blame if I failed to meet the goals that I had set myself.</p>
<p>I had in mind the rather arbitrary-sounding finish time of 2h 23m (extrapolated out from the 11 minute miles I had decided upon as my average pace goal), and in the end came in with a time of 2h 14m. My knee hurt a great deal in the aftermath of the race, but I’m convinced that was a result not of the overall length of the course, but of the pounding I gave it in the final two miles as I really pushed towards the line. Had I stuck to putting in miles of between 10m 30s and 11m 30s as planned, I think I could have run on for quite a while without any complaint from my legs.</p>
<p>As I crossed the line and had the timing chip cut from my shoe, I was handed a medal for completing the race, and a ticket by a marshal who told me I’d won a spot prize: this turned out to be a big tub of chocolates, which were welcome, even if the set of stairs I had to traverse to claim them were not.</p>
<p>I had only run half marathon distance three times prior to this race, and 2h 14m is a personal best by some way; I’m pretty happy with the effort, especially over such a tough course. The last two miles were done at a pace that I now most likely won’t reach again until after the London Marathon is complete. What remains is another six weeks of slowly, steadily training my body to accept longer distances. Hopefully the ankle problem is truly behind me. Hopefully the knee will repair over the coming week and be stronger for it. Perhaps the most interesting thing I took from today was the idea that just maybe when I take my place at the start line in London on 26 April, I don’t necessarily need to have my earphones in.</p>

			 <p>What was the last song you became obsessed with? Around this time last year I was playing St. Vincent’s ‘Digital Witness’ <em>a lot</em>, and singing it, humming it, or running parts through in my mind even when the headphones weren’t in. I have a history of that: songs that hook into some recess in me and loop endlessly, happily away seemingly without much effort on my part to call them to mind. But they’re also always the songs to which I find myself returning when I launch Rdio or pick up my phone to play something.</p>
<p>I think last January’s semi-obsessive repetition of that St. Vincent track was the last time it happened for me, but right now there’s another song playing over-and-over in my mind, and which I play (usually just once, but sometimes a couple of times through) at least every other day at this point: Irma Thomas’s 1964 single ‘Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)’.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The song is a three-minute masterpiece of plaintive longing and understated resolve. The subtle echo on Thomas’s voice is haunting and perfectly pitched to lend a hint of loneliness to her plight, and the instrumentation is similarly restrained: a simple piano refrain that sounds like it’s coming from another room, the drumming little more than tempo kept with a brush, and a bright xylophone scale that glints over the verses like light through breeze-blown trees. The pure magic of the track, for me, is caught in one moment at the end of each of the two choruses, with the choice of how to deliver those bracketed words from the title. Every time I play the song I can hear the usual, easy line for the end of that phrase: it starts earlier than Thomas actually does and goes up on the first syllable of ‘understand’ before levelling off. It’s the line that a thousand soul and alt-soul songs choose, and keeps those two words in their parenthetical place. Instead Thomas dips subtly down on that syllable, and extends it, rising slightly, before touching the final two syllables in a soft staccato. Somehow it shifts the whole weight of the song, making it not solely another love song but also a paean for understanding - as vulnerable as it is beautiful.</p>

			 <p>I’ve just finished re-reading Haruki Murakami’s <em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em> (2008). The first time I read the book it was as a fan of Murakami’s work, and over the last couple of weeks I’ve gone back through it as someone who is in training for their first marathon. It’s an odd book: a mix of autobiography, a kind of sports reportage, a little travel writing, and a healthy dose of something akin to philosophy. Murakami isn’t the kind of writer to present athletics in technicolour, super-sized with pomp and meaning; as with his fiction, he’s wonderful on the details: the rituals, the toll on the body, the workings of the mind during prolonged physical activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void. But as you might expect, an occasional thought will slip into this void. People’s minds can’t be a complete blank. Human beings’ emotions are not strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum. What I mean is, the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as I run remain subordinate to that void. Lacking content, they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are my favourite passages of the book, when Murakami meditates on what running has meant to him — what it has taught him. Murakami is a pretty strong and highly experienced runner, whereas I am currently that most dangerous of things: an advanced beginner. I have no aspirations to match the times or distances that he outlines in the book, but I do find much of Murakami’s psychological approach admirable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I’m criticised unjustly (from my point of view, at least), or when someone I’m sure will understand me doesn’t, I go running for a little longer than usual. By running longer it’s like I can physically exhaust that portion of my discontent. It also makes me realize again how weak I am, how limited my abilities are. I become aware, physically, of these low points. And one of the results of running a little father than usual is that I become that much stronger. If I’m angry, I direct that anger toward myself. If I have a frustrating experience, I use that to improve myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Murakami gets close to something I have also found, expressing it more eloquently than I could. To be engaged in something as simple as running, and yet to be confronted by this simple act with concrete proof of your limitations, is humbling. In a very concrete way you are presented with evidence of your mortality, your relative weakness, and you learn something about yourself that feels solid and true.</p>
<p>Writing from decades of experience as both a long-distance runner and the author of multiple lengthy novels, Murakami’s notes on concentrated effort and stamina have a ring of universality to them. As in his fiction it often seems that the simple object of his description is also being treated allegorically. This certainly makes the book worthy of re-reading, and I’m pleased to have been able to take from my second time through what I hope can be lessons, or at least aids the next time I lace up my shoes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Running] should add a few new elements to your inventory in understanding who you are. And as a result your view of your life, its colors and shape, should be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>2015 is off to a great start filmically: in just the first four days of the year I saw a pair of really interesting character studies that are also showpieces of meticulous direction. I thought I’d put together nothing more than a couple of paragraphs of encouragement to seek out these movies, as they’re both better seen without too much in the way of preconceptions.</p>
<h3 id="birdman-dir-alejandro-g-iñárritu-2014"><em>Birdman</em> dir. Alejandro G. Iñárritu (2014)</h3>
<p>I’ve been a Michael Keaton fan for a long while, and the run up to this film’s release was all about the excitement of getting to see him in a leading role that he could really get his teeth into. I found director Iñárritu’s <em>Babel</em> (2006) overlong and too ponderous, and the highly acclaimed <em>Amores Perros</em> (2000) remains a shameful blind spot in my recent cinema knowledge. However, <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/birdman/">the trailer for <em>Birdman</em></a> had an intriguing punk tone to it, and coupled with a really neat poster, I was also going in interested to see how the movie would work visually. </p>
<p>I was blown away on both counts. Keaton has perhaps never been better (though I remain a huge fan of the performances he delivers in <em>Multiplicity</em> (1996), <em>Pacific Heights</em> (1990) and, of course, <em>Batman</em> (1989) in particular), and Iñárritu’s direction (along with Emmanuel Lubezki’s DP work) is absolutely mesmerising throughout. The supposed <em>trick</em> here, of course, is that the whole 119 minutes appears to pass in one solid take - but the real trick is that Iñárritu &amp; Lubezki find a way to do that which doesn’t feel like empty showboating, but rather a vital element of the film’s interrogation of the relationship between the sibling media of cinema &amp; theatre.</p>
<h3 id="enemy-dir-denis-villeneuve-2013"><em>Enemy</em> dir. Denis Villeneuve (2013)</h3>
<p>And then, just after having my head spun by <em>Birdman</em> I find that Denis Villeneuve’s latest is available for rental. I really enjoyed his previous movie—2013’s <em>Prisoners</em>—and had been looking forward to <em>Enemy</em> after seeing <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/enemy/">the trailer</a> a while back.</p>
<p>Again, not to give too much away: Jake Gyllenhaal here plays two characters—a shy, somewhat withdrawn teacher, and a C-list movie actor—the relationship between whom is unclear. They circle each other, their orbits each affected by the other, in trajectories that complicate and darken as the film goes on. Both of Gyllenhaal’s performances are really accomplished: it’s genuinely impressive how he’s able to distinguish the two characters through posture and gesture where a lesser actor would resort to caricature. And the film itself—its look, its feel, its oddities—has really stayed in my thoughts. Immediately that it was finished I started looking around the internet for some explication of its more opaque corners, and I’ve found myself returning in my mind to some of the really striking imagery that Villeneuve constructs. As with <em>Birdman</em>, I’m aching to see it again already.<br>

<p>If these two don’t end up in the top five movies I see this year then 2015 will have been an absolutely outstanding year at the cinema. There are plenty of good reviews for each out there (eg. <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/birdman/"><em>Little White Lies</em> on <em>Birdman</em></a> &amp; <a href="http://thedissolve.com/reviews/632-enemy/"><em>The Dissolve</em> on <em>Enemy</em></a>) but if you trust me enough I fully recommend going into these as cold as possible and having your head opened up a little. Enjoy.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-deru--1979">20. Deru — <em>1979</em></h3>
<p>I was introduced to Deru via his contributions to the <em>Outliers: Volume 1 - Iceland</em>
project, in which his minimalist electronic soundscapes provided the perfect
accompaniment to long, languorous shots of Iceland’s stark landscapes. Over
the duration of an album the tone varies a little more, but retains a chill and a
slight distance. I kept returning to this record to be present with it, simply
because I like the colours it paints with and the patience with which it unfolds.</p>
<h3 id="19-kiasmos--kiasmos">19. Kiasmos — <em>Kiasmos</em></h3>
<p>Billed as Ólafur Arnalds’s electronica side-project, Kiasmos sounds pretty much
as that description would lead you to believe. Built around the basis of Arnalds’s
sweeping strings and intricate, sensitive piano patterns, the augmentation
provided here by synths and drum machines simply serves to lend another
texture to the sound. Sometimes there’s a switch to a pace Arnalds rarely
achieves in his solo work, but the majority of this record poses no surprises.
Regardless, I found myself enjoying this again and again.</p>
<h3 id="18-thom-yorke--tomorrows-modern-boxes">18. Thom Yorke — <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em></h3>
<p>Released by some unusual method — as is now the usual — and instantly
familiar-feeling to anyone who listened to Radiohead’s <em>The King of Limbs</em> (2011)
or Atoms for Peace’s <em>AMOK</em> (2013), <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em> is nevertheless
another fine set of glitchy, angsty, intricate clockworks wound up and let loose
by a master craftsman and endlessly curious tinkerer. Particularly if you
enjoyed the album versions of tracks from Yorke’s <em>The Eraser</em> (2006), before
they morphed and grew slightly when Atoms for Peace came on board to play them live, you’ll feel right at home with this understated collection of modest
but accomplished work.</p>
<h3 id="17-east-india-youth--total-strife-forever">17. East India Youth — <em>Total Strife Forever</em></h3>
<p>A complete mystery to me upon first listen, William Doyle’s set of glittering,
swimming electronica eventually coalesced into something I felt I could get my
hands around. Conversely, I learned the best way to do that was simply to allow
it to wash over me. The titular quartet could have been released as a standalone
work, but surrounding those tracks with more tonally-varied pieces really
serves to bring them into relief as the spine of the album but not its flesh. I’m
not a huge fan of Doyle’s falsetto vocal (which creeps in a few times here and
there and is underwhelming rather than wholly off-putting), but his ear for the
melodic throughline to a complex miasma of sound is impressive throughout.</p>
<h3 id="16-liars--mess">16. Liars — <em>Mess</em></h3>
<p>No two Liars albums are the same, and in the shape of <em>Mess</em> they’ve released
perhaps their best since the career high of <em>Drum’s Not Dead</em> (2006). Opener
‘Mask Maker’ seems like a deliberate attempt to forewarn the listener that
they’re in for a rough ride, but if one can learn to lean into the swings and take
the bumps there’s so much here to be infected by. The album’s best track ‘Mess
on a Mission’ is perhaps the band’s best to date, not to mention the best theme
tune for a non-existent, Warren Ellis-scripted, True Detective-on-
amphetamines, HBO show I can imagine. Liars are talented at conjuring the
sound of nightmares, and are not afraid of unleashing music that is at first
seemingly incomprehensible. Learn to love it however, and you’ll find a lot to
love.</p>
<h3 id="15-tycho--awake">15. Tycho — <em>Awake</em></h3>
<p>I caught up with this album so, so late in the year and have a feeling that given
time to blossom in my mind it may float further up this list. Quickly my
favourite release on label-of-the-year contender Ghostly International, <em>Awake</em> is
a stunning collection of sur-ambient tracks that swell and sweep along lines
that quickly seem familiar and yet continue to grow in the mind with each
listen. I can foresee this being a record I return to for quite a while to come; I’m
already kicking myself a little for not picking it up upon release.</p>
<h3 id="14-sisyphus--sisyphus">14. Sisyphus — <em>Sisyphus</em></h3>
<p>I’m not even sure how I came across this record — perhaps via the Son Lux
connection — but even on first listen I was fascinated by its variety and by how
singular so many of its elements felt. Opening track ‘Calm it Down’ is
doubtlessly one of my tracks of 2014, and Serengeti’s laid-back, self-assured
flow was one of the discoveries of the year for me. The album as a whole is
restlessly inventive - constantly trying on new styles, sometimes two or three
within the space of a single track: soul, hip-hop, R&amp;B, electronica - they’re all in
the mix here, and the combination was consistently alluring to me. My favourite
moment at the time of writing is on ‘Booty Call’: the delivery of the line “Im’a
kiss you like a bubble in the brooks.” I don’t even need to know what that
actually means.</p>
<h3 id="13-aphex-twin--syro">13. Aphex Twin — <em>Syro</em></h3>
<p>The last time Richard James put out an Aphex Twin album my interest in
electronic music was very slight, but even then I knew the name and something
of the reputation. <em>Syro</em> appeared amongst much fanfare in September, and
hasn’t moved far down my ‘recently played’ list since. I used the term ‘restlessly
inventive’ above to describe Sisyphus’s melange of styles, but it applies here too;
I don’t think any two bars of <em>Syro</em> are identical; things are always shifting,
different elements of a track taking momentary prominence and then being
subverted or switched out for some other stem. Four months hasn’t scratched
the surface of unlocking <em>Syro</em> in my mind, but there’s something special about a
record that still feels ultimately unknowable after so much play.</p>
<h3 id="12-manic-street-preachers--futurology">12. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Futurology</em></h3>
<p>At this point in their career it’s a wonder that the Manics are still able to
surprise. But, whilst the vast majority of its component parts are drawn from
elsewhere in their storied history, <em>Futurology</em> still manages to arrange the
building-blocks into some wonderful new shapes. Billed as a poppier
counterpart to last year’s <em>Rewind the Film</em> the album finds the band going
straight ahead on some tracks (’Sex, Power, Love and Money’, ‘Between the
Clock and the Bed’) but still finding plenty of room for introspection (‘Walk me
to the Bridge’) and edgier-sounding fare. ‘The Next Jet to Leave Moscow’ could
only have been written by a band old enough to harbour regrets; their
willingness to spill them and work them through like this is admirable, and to our benefit. When the sums are totalled up this is the fourth in a run of great,
and very different-feeling, albums from The Manics since 2009.</p>
<h3 id="11-caribou--our-love">11. Caribou — <em>Our Love</em></h3>
<p>After a while spent in its company <em>Our Love</em> resolves into a beautiful collection
of bright, spacious electronica. I found myself returning to it as a default album
for lightening an afternoon, or to run to in the evenings. Perfectly paced,
meticulously crafted rhythms are brought to life by an inventive instrumental
palate that kept me guessing until it crept into my head completely. Album
highlight ‘Second Chance’ takes a gamble on the kind of vocal that commonly
renders tracks skippable for me, but for some indiscernible reason here makes it
the song I returned to most often. That’s just one of a thousand impeccable
decisions made by Dan Snaith in his production of a record that took up root on
the brighter end of my electronica spectrum and stayed firmly planted through
the darker months.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-acid--liminal">10. The Acid — <em>Liminal</em></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Liminal&rsquo; is one of my favourite words, and one I perhaps over-used in poetry
seminars. It’s also a word I apply mentally to certain albums and pieces of
music. Deftones’ <em>White Pony</em> (2000) feels that way to me, as does <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) for some reason. The Acid (of whom the only member I was previously
familiar with is Adam Freeland) have chosen a good title for their debut LP
however: the music on <em>Liminal</em> emerges and grows organically, fades, shifts,
and evokes powerfully its own sense of place.</p>
<p>‘Creeper’ is propulsive and straining at itself to break free. ‘Basic Instinct’ is
understated and makes good use of the vocal effect the record’s production
relies on throughout to mask a relatively slight range. I found that with this
record, perhaps because it is so successful in evoking a particular mood, I had to
be in the right mood to play it - but when that mood hit there was little better
than spending time inside the world it builds.</p>
<h3 id="9-nothing--guilty-of-everything">9. Nothing — <em>Guilty Of Everything</em></h3>
<p>The closest stylistic analogue for what Nothing are doing on their debut is
shoegaze, but various elements of their sound push at and perhaps tear the
edges of that envelope. Whilst tracks like ‘Endlessly’ are firmly within the tradition of My Bloody Valentine et al, ‘Get Well’ is too rhythmic and danceable, and ‘Somersault’ is closer to something from Hope of the States’ <em>The Lost Riots</em>
(2004).</p>
<p>Regardless, the production of the record understands well what the band’s
ambition is: to flood the listener’s head with glorious, monochrome noise so
that they feel subsumed by and imbued with it.</p>
<h3 id="8-taylor-mcferrin--early-riser">8. Taylor McFerrin — <em>Early Riser</em></h3>
<p>For some reason I didn’t listen to much jazz this year (Otis Brown III’s <em>The
Thought of You</em> perhaps the best jazz qua jazz LP I spent any significant time
with), and even this is borderline. McFerrin’s modus operandi is to interweave
soulful, understated electronica through elements of jazz (‘4am’, ‘Already
There’), R&amp;B (‘The Antidote’), and back into soul itself (opener, and entrant on
the track-of-the-year shortlist, ‘Postpartum’). Something about the resulting
mix (perhaps the way it moves seamlessly from one sound to another) really
worked for me. On weekend mornings and walks into work it was a pleasure to
be accompanied by this album which, in all its forms, suffuses light and good
feeling.</p>
<h3 id="7-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-2">7. Run The Jewels — <em>Run The Jewels 2</em></h3>
<p>Hip-hop didn’t come through for me this year either. The new Common album
didn’t get close to the hype, the long-awaited Wu Tang Clan LP had its moments
but was never going to be a classic, and the same goes for The Roots’ <em>…And
Then You Shoot Your Cousin</em>. Kanye took a year off, Jay-Z took a year off, who
knows if Yasiin Bey / Mos Def is working on anything?</p>
<p>Anyway, all of which set the stage for something new and Run The Jewels took
full advantage. El-P is a decent rapper and a flat-out great beat-maker. With this
record following up 2013’s <em>R.A.P. Music</em> Killer Mike is making a play for Kanye’s
crown, with a knack for twisted, quotable, clever lyrics and an incredible,
relaxed flow that drives the record.</p>
<p>The album is obviously conceived as a whole - it wouldn’t surprise me to find
that El-P considered the sequencing as carefully as any individual beat. ‘Jeapordy’ comes with no warning, things build on ‘Oh My Darling Don’t Cry’ and when the beat drops on ‘Blockbuster Night Part 1’ I just about lose it each time. But then it goes up another level on ‘Close Your Eyes’, which also happens to feature Zach de la Rocha’s best verse since he stepped out for Saul Williams in 2004.</p>
<h3 id="6-the-new-pornographers--brill-bruisers">6. The New Pornographers — <em>Brill Bruisers</em></h3>
<p>I was a big fan of <em>Twin Cinema</em> (2005) but haven’t exactly flipped for the two
New Pornographers records between then and now. <em>Brill Bruisers</em>, however, is
an unqualified triumph. The opening track is bombastic and sing-along whilst
also proving a great showcase for the band’s huge sound. I love the way
‘Champions of Red Wine’ shimmers and builds, and ‘War on the East Coast’
pulls a bait and switch by flipping from dirge to glam in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Carl Newman refers to Brill Bruisers as &ldquo;a celebration record&rdquo; and certainly it
sticks to the brighter, more upbeat end of the band’s spectrum. The production
is outstanding, and having several male and female vocalists allows for a
dialogue and a lyrical dynamic that works here as it does for Arcade Fire. Take
for example album best ‘Born With A Sound’, which could easily find a home on
<em>The Suburbs</em>: when Amber Webber sings “I want you all of the time” by herself a
shiver runs through me without fail.</p>
<h3 id="5-submerse--slow-waves">5. Submerse — <em>Slow Waves</em></h3>
<p>With the majority of what I listen to these days falling somewhere on the
electronica spectrum, Submerse managed to pinpoint precisely where my head
is with this stuff at the moment. Lushly-produced, infinitely warm
soundscapes, and wonderfully balanced instrumentation helped make this
probably my most-played album of 2014.</p>
<p>Other plaudits headed <em>Slow Waves’s</em> way include best album cover of the year
and best opening track in the form of the stunning ’Let’s Never Come Back Here
Again’. Other highlights include the alluring wash of ‘Snorlax’ and ‘VHS.chords’,
which weaves circa–8-bit videogame sound effects subtly through its ebb and
flow. I’ve been struggling to pinpoint precisely what it is that Rob Orme (aka
Submerse) does so well, and I think the key to this sound is the perfect balance
of organic-seeming electronica: there’s nothing cold here, it all feels very much
as though each of its musical capillaries is pulsing with warmth.</p>
<h3 id="4-spoon--they-want-my-soul">4. Spoon — <em>They Want My Soul</em></h3>
<p>The narrative around the release of this record was all too concerned with the
longevity of the band’s career. As someone with — for better or worse — limited prior
connection with Spoon, I was able to look at the album objectively and found it
to be nothing less or more complicated than a great rock record.</p>
<p>It’s a cleverly sequenced album: ‘Rent I Pay’ is a statement of intent to open
with, ‘Inside Out’ is more ruminative, slightly poppier, and ‘Rainy Taxi’ serves
to display a cutting edge. Most of these 10 tracks move between moods
throughout their runtime, as though the band have too many great ideas for one
album. Nothing feels forced or poorly-executed however - it’s clear without
knowing the back catalogue that this is a group of musicians very assured in
what they’re making.</p>
<p>The warm, just-fuzzy-enough production is outstanding, and is tweaked
masterfully to fit around each song just perfectly. I’ll be playing the title track
and the bombastic, anthem to bravery ’Let Me Be Mine’ for a long while to come - as well as most of the rest of the album I should think.</p>
<h3 id="3-sbtrkt--wonder-where-well-land">3. SBTRKT — <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em></h3>
<p>Previous to this year my only knowledge of SBTRKT was via a couple of (pretty
great) Radiohead remixes (of ‘Everything In Its Right Place’ &amp; ‘Lotus Flower’).
The path to changing that was an odd one: I picked up the single ’NEW DORP.
NEW YORK’ via Ezra Koenig’s Twitter, and liked but didn’t love it. That was
enough to get me to tune into the album via Rdio, and soon after I had
purchased it and was playing a couple of tracks more-or-less daily. There’s a
great variety of styles on display over the generous 15 track running order, but I
started to get even more out of the record when it clicked for me that it had been
built for consumption as a whole.</p>
<p>‘The Light’ sounds like it belongs on a sexier version of <em>Hail To The Thief</em>;
’Temporary View’ — tinged with R&amp;B — is plaintive and uplifting; ‘Higher’
features Raury delivering probably my favourite hip-hop vocal performance of
the year.</p>
<p>For whatever reason even the outlets I’m usually fairly in sync with on music
were relatively down on this record (Pitchfork: 55%; Resident Advisor: 5/10).
That’s a puzzle to me as I continue to find new reasons to love a huge, warm
album in which it’s a pleasure to get lost for a while.</p>
<h3 id="2-st-vincent--st-vincent">2. St. Vincent — <em>St. Vincent</em></h3>
<p>I really liked Annie Clark’s 2009 album <em>Actor</em>, but this record quickly inspired a
whole new level of devotion. That was the case right from the release of ‘Digital
Witness’ on the sixth day of the year - a track I’m still playing regularly 12
months later and have not grown the slightest bit tired of.</p>
<p>‘Birth in Reverse’ is all angular guitar and too-deep grooves, ‘Bring Me Your
Loves’ makes something astounding out of the under-practiced sub-genre of
lament-as-anthem. But it’s ‘Digital Witness’ that still rings the clearest for me as
the album’s centrepiece: in tone and subject matter a kissing-cousin to much of
Arcade Fire’s <em>Reflektor</em>, and just as stirring to each the heart, head, and hips.</p>
<h3 id="1-death-from-above-1979--the-physical-world">1. Death From Above 1979 — <em>The Physical World</em></h3>
<p>I still remember the day in 2006 when I read the post on DFA1979’s website in
which Jesse Keller used those fateful words: “We decided to stop doing the
band…”. That was two years after having released the singularly powerful <em>You’re
A Woman, I’m A Machine</em> and thereby shifting my whole conception of how
much noise two people could make, as well as altering the topography of the
post-punk landscape.</p>
<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of
this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of
the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve
the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power
is a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>
<p>(As an aside, a neat accompaniment to the album was also released this year in
the form of Eva Michon’s insightful, up-close-and-personal doc <em>Life After Death
From Above 1979</em>, which chronicles the tour cycle of the first record, the falling
apart, and the reconstitution of the band.)</p>
<p>‘Right On, Frankenstein!’ &amp; ‘The Physical World’ are my favourite tracks here,
but the whole thing is pretty outstanding from start to finish. Brutal, danceable,
chantable, and full of great hooks - I couldn’t be happier to have DFA1979 back
in the world.</p>

			 <p>OK, maybe you were expecting this. I know that the internet just exploded upon the release of the first teaser trailer for JJ Abrams’s <em>The Force Awakens</em>, but <em>Star Wars</em> has been such a huge part of my life since childhood that I can’t help but add my two pennies’ worth to the flood of opinions that greeted the trailer’s arrival. So here goes nothin’:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/b03c21b8f6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For all of his <a href="https://twitter.com/bad_robot/status/474206241603198976">playful hinting</a> from the set in the wake of spoilers, Abrams’s choice of first shot in the teaser can be read as a reminder that there’s still so much about <em>Episode VII</em> that we don’t know. For example, here’s John Boyega, whom we knew was cast of course, but it’s as though Abrams is intentionally confronting you straight off with the fact that you don’t know the character’s name, whether or not he’s actually a stormtrooper, why he’s so panicked in the sequence… even whether that’s Tatooine.</p>
<p>Secondly, it feels like we’re very deliberately being shown a man in the uniform, sans helmet, Abrams playing up the fact that this isn’t a faceless clone - a subtle way to differentiate his film from the clone-filled prequel trilogy in the minds of people who have a problem with those films.</p>
<p>There’s also a probe droid-esque noise in the background, which—along with Boyega’s outfit—raises some very interesting questions. Remember how Luke <em>et al</em> destroyed the second Death Star, and Vader threw The Emperor to his death, and there were dancing Ewoks and fireworks and everyone celebrating the end of The Empire? Yeah, well so how come ~30 years later there’s still all these stormtroopers around?</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/f6a6a185e3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Feels to me like that guy in the middle is, as Princess Leia would say, a little short for a stormtrooper. Cue wild speculation about why Boyega (5’9”) is hiding out amongst the Imperial ranks, and who is pulling a blaster on whom in the kerfuffle teased here.</p>
<p>Wait - we missed a shot. And it’s the cutest shot too.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/6a5624bece.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Look at that guy! He’s like Artoo meets Wall·E! It’s amazing how much personality this little dude has for less than three seconds of screen time. <a href="http://jalopnik.com/lets-take-a-deep-look-at-the-droid-in-the-new-star-wars-1664482684">Jalopnik has a neat tear-down on this spherical droid</a> which includes discussion of where he might fit in the R-series, and a potential explanation for that head bobble he’s got going on. Also, check out the background for what looks to be a somewhat worse-for-wear podracer engine. Again, not a sure sign we’re on Tatooine, but a possible hint nonetheless.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/587a0c0961.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And here’s Daisy Ridley as… well, everyone’s calling her Kira, though that’s unconfirmed right now. Her character is also rumoured to be the daughter of Han &amp; Leia (so long <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page">Jaina, Jacen &amp; Anakin Solo</a>), but again: speculation at this point. Here’s what is confirmed: she’s in a rush just like that little sphere droid (again, <em>rumoured</em> to belong to her); she looks scared like Boyega; those shades are <em>probably</em> made from a salvaged stormtrooper helmet; that speeder is <strong>cool</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/52ba3c1891.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And then we get to see Oscar Isaac in an X-Wing! Rebel symbols, tinted orange visors, but blue stripes down the sides and <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/S-foils">S-foils</a> that tilt up at the ends? Also, glorious nerds have translated the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Aurebesh">Aurebesh</a> on Isaac’s vest as ‘PULL TO INFLATE’!</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/900790e1f9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is my favourite shot in the trailer: a squadron of X-Wings skimming the surface of a body of water, backgrounded by mountains - this looks like an entirely different environment to all of the action of the trailer so far. At this point it’s clear that Abrams is using his year-ahead teaser trailer to hit on all of the buttons <em>Star Wars</em> fans want pushed. In a little over a minute here we’re given shots of multiple new characters, a new droid, a couple of familiar-seeming but also new vehicles, and a glimpse at a couple of the planets we’ll visit in twelve long months’ time.</p>
<p>And then this:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/72946beb7e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Who’s this guy? Is this Adam Driver? Is it his voiceover we’re hearing throughout (or is that Serkis? or von Sydow?)? Perhaps the only thing that’s obvious is that he’s bad news before he even ignites that lightsaber, and when he does we’re left to speculate about how best to reconcile that leaked concept image of the alleged <a href="http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2014/08/rumor-indie-revolver-reveals-first.html">Sith Inquisitor</a> with the (now pretty legitimate) leaked image of <a href="https://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2014/10/massive-amount-of-episode-vii-concept.html">this masked dude</a>. Also, where is he? Looks too snowy to be the desert planet, and whilst it’s <em>possible</em> we’re in the foothills of those lakeside mountains we just glimpsed, it’s equally possible we’re somewhere else entirely.</p>
<p>So, add a villain to the list of what we’re teased with and it feels like a full house. It seems like such a smart decision at this stage to focus on what’s new and keep the reveals of the returning cast members for later. (Watch the internet melt the day we see frame one of Han Solo!) Intrigue, excitement, new stormtrooper helmets… what more could you want?</p>
<p>Oh…</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/99a0248706.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The longest single shot in the trailer is pre-empted by a beat of black, and then that John Williams score, the looping arc, the scream of TIE Fighters. It’s amazing how much power some symbols retain. <em>Star Wars</em> holds a unique place in popular culture, certain elements of its mythology seemingly so deeply ingrained that even those who have no interest in it know the names of central characters and may be able to quote a line or two. It’s perfectly plausible that people who have never seen one film from the series will still recognise the Millennium Falcon. For those of us who grew up with and love <em>Star Wars</em> this shot is enough to bring tears to the eyes (whilst sat alone in a Regent Street branch of Starbucks). Who’s at the controls? What’s with that new-shaped radar dish? Are those TIEs shooting at each other? We’ll have to wait a while to find out.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.adrian-tomine.com">Adrian Tomine</a> is probably my favourite comics writer &amp; artist working today. I got into his work with <em>Shortcomings</em> (2007), and immediately went back through <em>Summer Blonde</em> (2002), <em>Sleepwalk</em> (1998) and the rawer <em>Optic Nerve</em> stuff (-1998). Since then I’ve picked up pretty much anything with Tomine’s name on it: the 2004 scrapbook of uncollected work, the postcard set, and 2012’s <em>New York Drawings</em> - a wonderful hardback collection of the covers and pieces of artwork that Tomine has contributed to <em>The New Yorker</em> over more than a decade.</p>
<p>The cover of that book features Tomine’s best-known piece: <em>Missed Connection</em>, which was first published as a <em>New Yorker</em> cover on the <a href="https://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2004-11-08#folio=CV1">8 Nov 2004 issue</a>, ten years ago today. It depicts a man and a woman, seated on separate subway train cars, making eye contact and holding copies of the same book.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/75a0e74920.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There’s something immediately sad about the scene - the simultaneous sense of possibility and the loss thereof; the unfairness of their being powerless to change the fate of being headed in different directions. I can’t help but wonder where those two are going, what the likelihood of their encountering each other again might be, just what exactly they are losing by passing by each other. Whilst Tomine’s graphic novel work is full of great characterisation and well-wrought narrative, his ability to capture emotionally resonant moments in single frames is often simply astounding.  Nowhere is this more elegantly done than in ‘Missed Connection’.</p>
<p>Prints of the piece (along with many others) are for sale via <a href="http://www.adrian-tomine.com/Prints.html">Tomine’s site</a>, and more information on his catalogue can be found via his publisher: <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/author/adrian-tomine">Drawn &amp; Quarterly</a>.</p>

			 <p>In 200 days I’ll be doing something perhaps a little crazy - something I wouldn’t have believed, a couple of years ago, that I even would have attempted: I’ll be running the 2015 London Marathon.</p>
<p>I haven’t been running all that long. Having grown up asthmatic and bookish I spend most of my teens and even 20s eschewing pretty much all kinds of exercise where possible, and only laced up a pair of running shoes about three years ago. I remember distinctly, in the early and even medium stages of the ‘couch-to–5K’ programme I was on, feeling like completing a 5K was near impossible… then it was something I accomplished. After that it seemed like trying to break 30 minutes was an insurmountable barrier… until I did it. It’s still kind of shocking to me how quickly running 5K became just something I do a couple or three times a week. The next challenge was longer distances, and recently I broke the hour barrier for 10K. Not world-beating pace, but another personal goal achieved.</p>
<p>I feel like running has taught me something about perseverance—about patience—and has helped shape my temperament over the last three years to some extent. I think of it as a similar discipline to meditation, and approach the two with a similar mindset. Both have taught me about my limitations and helped me start to reach a bit beyond some of them.</p>
<p>I don’t feel anywhere near ready for a marathon! But then, perhaps that’s how you’re supposed to feel with 200 days to go. The jump from 10K to 42.2K is genuinely daunting, and right now the thought of running constantly for what is likely to be somewhere around 4.5 hours is painful. But if it was easy I guess it wouldn’t be as worth doing.</p>
<p>So, now I have 200 days ahead of me in which the marathon will factor into almost everything else I do: 200 days of watching what I eat, training consistently and increasingly vigorously, and working towards a goal that right now seems kind of impossible. As soon as the acceptance letter came through I sublimated my anxiety with two things: first I used it as an excuse to hit the Nike store for gait analysis and finally upgrade my shoes (new Lunarglide 6s are winging their way to me as I type); secondly, I started to think about which charities I’d like to run for. The London Marathon remains Britain’s biggest single-day fundraising event, which in-and-of-itself is pretty remarkable, and if I’m going to put myself through a lot over the next 200 days I’d like it to be about something bigger than just myself. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Update: I ran for Macmillan Cancer Support &amp; POTS UK; this post has been edited to remove a link to a donation page, since the event is now over.]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I’m looking forward to it, though anxiously. And I’ll make sure to keep you all updated on how much I’m missing sugar, and hating the hours spent running through snow-filled streets. Wish me more than luck.</p>

			 <p>The difference between music played from record and music played live is, or should be, the human elements: spontaneity, invention, emotional immediacy. A good record can be wonderful company, its unchanging nature a great comfort - knowing you can return to it, an old friend, and avail yourself of its familiar charms. And it may seem to change, a little, as <em>you</em> change. The act or manner of your receiving it is altered as you are through time, but the recording is a static object.</p>
<p>A great majority of my relationships with art are of this nature. The books, films, paintings etc. that I love, like the records, don&rsquo;t change. I change, my perception of them changes, and there&rsquo;s value in that evolution; one can see oneself reflected in it. How you relate to a book <em>differently</em> to how you once did. What a painting <em>used</em> to mean to you. What you <em>thought</em> a movie was about.</p>
<p>Like performed music, the life of a piece of theatre exists in its human elements and is amplified by uniqueness. Where an academic career in literature nurtured in me the love of the word as written—of <em>text</em>—it has primarily been the decade-plus I have spent working in theatre that has convinced me, slowly but incontrovertibly, of the unique power of performed art.</p>
<p>There was a seed sown maybe at undergraduate level, when I first started reading Samuel Beckett. There is much in Beckett to love on the page: he is lyrical, supremely intelligent, wickedly funny, and can be hauntingly insightful. However, studying the plays alongside the novels and poetry, I began to discern the unique ability of performance to deliver something that even the most beautifully constructed paragraphs of text could not. At their core, perhaps necessarily, my most cherished experiences with texts are cerebral: the thrill of having a new point of view revealed to you, of being transported mentally to another set of circumstances, of becoming acquainted with persons entirely constructed by you, the reader, in collusion with a remote author—the atomic elements of which construction a mere 26 characters and attendant squiggles and dots of punctuation—all this remains something akin to magic in my mind. But there are things that the printed word cannot do.</p>
<p>The mere fact of having a living human being take the stage before you is enough to start firing up empathic impulses that even the most beautifully written first-person narratives can’t reach. Taking that as a starting point the stakes of live performance are exponentially higher, and the potential rewards more visceral, more immediate, less cognitively and more limbically driven. I have long loved film, which seems to fall here at some kind of half-way point: recorded media with a human face. As with recorded music there’s the luxury of replayability, of examining at one’s leisure the minutiae of a performance, and marvelling at the artistry by which it is heightened: camera angle and motion, editing, sound design…. All of which, again, is an exercise in appreciation at a remove that retains great value. But I have found some of the thrill of theatre also to be contained in the knowledge that what one is witnessing is happening in the manner in which one is witnessing it precisely once. No two performances will be the same, no two encounters between you as audience and the performer will be identical. Partly yes, as with the books and the paintings, you’ll carry something into the exchange on a subsequent occasion that wasn’t there the first time around, but also this in front of you is another full person, adding to the equation their own infinity of potential, broadening out the horizon of possibilities as to what might happen between you in the course of the thing to unknowable, dizzying dimensions unfathomable in the case of safe, unchanging works of static, non-performed art.</p>

			 <p>Richard D James just released the first album under the Aphex Twin name for 14 years, and—perhaps just as unexpectedly—has conducted <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/aphex-twin/">a lengthy interview with Pitchfork</a>.</p>
<p>Reading the piece I was struck by the manner in which a number of James’s thoughts seemed applicable universally across all creative disciplines, and at all levels of output. For instance, there’s this on procrastination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then I realized I actually like making studios more than making music, because I like the possibilities of what you can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of times I can convince myself to purchase a new notebook, or spend time tweaking settings in my suite of writing apps, instead of getting to work is maddening, and James captures that idea neatly. Sometimes it becomes about the setup rather than about the process, and the key is in catching yourself before that becomes too consuming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just really wish I could bloody keep the same setup for more than about five minutes, because then I would actually get good at that setup. But I just get bored and swap things out.</p>

<p>Similarly there’s something here about routine, and the ease with which we fall into the trap of changing the wrong things as a way of avoiding the real work. It’s easy to start feeling like the important part is that you have the correct items of kit, and that that’s enough for the work to magically start to flow. When that doesn’t happen I’m certainly dumb enough to think endlessly about changing the setup instead of persevering with the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to be a bit secretive and didn’t want people to know what I was using, or get too fixated and waste their money buying equipment, because it’s not about what equipment you have, it’s what you do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there’s this, which is important I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best artists are people who don’t consider themselves artists, and the people who do are usually the most pretentious and annoying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endless ink has been spilled, and pixels rearranged, on the ways in which the advent of digital has reframed both the publishing &amp; consumption of art; I’ve read less on how that has altered our understanding of what it means to be an ‘artist’. Something about James’s comment speaks to the fact that it’s ultimately the work that’s important, rather than the source. It’s not who you or your marketing team say you are; it’s not the vector by which your output reaches its audience; it’s not even your pedigree that matters - it’s the thing you’ve made, and how it makes people feel. Which, actually, James is also brilliant on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you hear a C-major chord with an equal temperament, you’ve heard it a million times before and your brain accepts it. But if you hear a chord that you’ve never heard before, you’re like, “huh.” And your brain has to change shape to accept it. And once it’s changed shape, then you have changed as a person, in a tiny way. And if you have a whole combination of all these different frequencies, you’re basically reconfiguring your brain. And then you’ve changed as a person, and you can go and do something else. It’s a constant change.</p>

			 <p>Let’s talk briefly about the endless runner. The first instance of the genre I recall encountering was <a href="http://www.twitter.com/adamatomic">Adam Saltsman</a>’s <em>Canabalt</em> in 2009, and it instantly seemed like a game-type whose time had come with the advent of touchscreen handhelds. The roots of the endless runner — with its constantly moving protagonist and emphasis simply on survival as a measure of success — seem to lie in those dreaded platforming levels where the screen scrolls at a constant pace. Entering those levels in Super Mario World or similar, I was usually frustrated by the inability to take a breath and plan my next move, or to take time to break all the blocks I wanted - having control of pace taken from me as a player was often irritating in those circumstances, but that’s not my experience with endless runners as they&rsquo;ve developed into a bona fide subgenre.</p>
<p>It has something to do with the relative simplicity of what’s being asked: to assume control of the character’s movement in a single axis (normally the y in the games I’ve played) and to sustain movement as long as possible. Just as the simplicity of the controls make the genre perfect for playing on an iPhone, so too does the conceit that you’re doing well if you last more than a minute or two, which works well for playing in bursts. However, the genre also has a powerful one-more-go pull that means you can sit and play for a while. Here are my four favourite endless runners, including the two great releases from this last week that inspired this post:</p>
<h3 id="canabalt">Canabalt</h3>
<p>There’s evidence to suggest the endless runner dates back to Commodore 64 gaming in the 80s, but there’s no denying it was <a href="http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/"><em>Canabalt</em></a> that popularised the genre in the modern era. Quite rightly it was one of the first inductees to <a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters/">MoMA’s video game collection</a> in 2012.</p>
<h3 id="super-hexagon">Super Hexagon</h3>
<p><a href="http://superhexagon.com">This one</a> (from Terry Cavanagh) works slightly differently to many of the other entries in the genre, but it’s coming from the same place in terms of gameplay: move that little triangle on its hexagonal axis and keep it from crashing into the incoming walls as long as possible. (As with many endless runners — for some reason — also features a killer soundtrack, this one from <a href="http://chipzel.co.uk">Chipzel</a>).</p>
<h3 id="fotonica">Fotonica</h3>
<p>I had this <a href="http://www.fotonica-game.com">first-person twist on the endless runner</a> for Mac, but it makes so much sense on a touchscreen handheld and the new iOS version is perfectly executed.</p>
<h3 id="alone">Alone</h3>
<p>Described to me as ‘<em>Canabalt</em> at the speed of <em>Super Hexagon</em> and somehow living up to that hype - <a href="http://www.laserdog.co.uk/alone">this is the game</a> I’m currently reaching for when I want to briefly flood my system with a hit of adrenaline.</p>

			 <p>Richard Linklater is one of those rare film directors whose output I’m always compelled by; there’s a meditative streak to the best of his work that I’m really drawn to. It’s there in the stoned, brink-of-adulthood ruminations of <em>SubUrbia</em> (1996), and  the hypnotic, dreamlike conversations of <em>Waking Life</em> (2001). For all of its visual flamboyance, its that same philosophical bent that drives 2006’s (much underrated and under-appreciated ) <em>A Scanner Darkly</em>. And where Linklater’s love for language and ideas really blossoms, of course, is with the <em>Before…</em> trilogy (…<em>Sunrise</em> (1995); …<em>Sunset</em> (2004); &amp; <a href="/beforemidnight">…<em>Midnight</em> (2013)</a>): a cinematic triptych that has a special place in my heart - its characters re-visited every nine years and almost exactly that same distance removed from my own age so that it feels oddly personal, like a visit from the ghost of relationships future.</p>
<p>Not having any knowledge of <em>Boyhood</em> (2014) until shortly before its release, I had a hard time picturing how cinema could match Linklater’s <em>Before…</em> films for the powerful pull of watching a life unfold. (The works coming closest to this in recent years are less grounded, more synesthetic pieces like Malick&rsquo;s (stunning) <em>Tree of Life</em> (2011) and—in some odd, diagonal way—Aronofsky&rsquo;s <em>The Fountain</em> (2006).) And yet, all this time, Linklater was playing himself at his own game: shooting <em>Boyhood</em> piecemeal over more than a decade he has put together exactly the kind of beautiful, human narrative showcased in the <em>Before…</em> films, but without allowing himself to cut away for the best part of a decade between sequences. <em>Boyhood</em> is interested in its characters in the same way as the <em>Before&hellip;</em> pictures and <em>Waking Life</em>  are, and as too few other films seem to be. All of the drama plays out at a relatable level and is all the more powerful for it: no car chases, no gunfights, just the vividly rendered ups &amp; downs of a simple life. (Or, rather, the first couple of decades of one - somewhat greedily I find myself hoping that the project will continue on and I&rsquo;ll be sitting down for <em>Manhood</em> in 2026.)</p>
<p>I was so happy at this year’s Oscars to see Spike Jonze take home a richly deserved award; come March next year Linklater should also have a statue on his mantlepiece. Two easygoing auteurs with a penchant for modest personal exploration - a decade or so ago they seemed unlikely winners. But time, as Linklater’s oeuvre will inform you, has a funny way of changing things.</p>

			 <p>I have just put down Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> having read the final 50 pages in one sitting of constant wrestling between competing desires: to speed through to its conclusion, and to savour its every last word. The final chapters have left me a little stunned, entirely in awe of how sublimely they are written, and—not to put too fine a point on it—elated; glad simply to  have been so touched by a work of art.</p>
<p>The final moments of Chad Harbach’s <em>The Art of Fielding</em> (2011) had a similar emotional upswing that quite literally sent a shiver up my spine, but Tartt’s execution is more sustained. At the end of her 850 page novel she’s bold enough to have her narrator elucidate the emotional truth of the narrative, and somehow it not only works but is thrilling in a way it has no right to be. It’s a trick only a writer of Tartt’s talent could even consider attempting, the poor execution of which would undermine all that had come before. The effect of its resounding success is to leave the reader feeling as though they have been struck like a bell - something of the work itself vibrating out and through them. Personally I don’t think I’ve felt that upon completing a novel since I first read Michael Ondaatje’s <em>In the Skin of a Lion</em>.</p>
<p>I can’t recommend <em>The Goldfinch</em> strongly enough. Read it around Christmas when some of its most important passages are set, when the evenings have grown short and it’s snowing outside. See if there isn’t something there that will be a light and a warmth to you.</p>

			 <p>Time for far too many words of tech nerdery, as I put the two premiere &lsquo;read-it-later&rsquo; services head-to-head in order to determine which I should be using at present.</p>
<h3 id="icon">Icon</h3>
<p>In the first instance, I place quite a lot of stock—perhaps too much—in how my iPhone’s home screen looks. The Pocket icon is pleasingly colourful and for whatever reason the hint at depth that plays along the lower edge doesn’t look out of place amidst the otherwise flat sensibility of iOS 7.</p>
<p>The Instapaper icon has two weaknesses as far as my taste is concerned: firstly it’s black and white, so lets the side down a bit in terms of my home screen’s otherwise pretty colourful array, and secondly it features a prominent capital ‘I’ that (through some quirk of how my brain is wired) I cannot help but pronounce to myself, inwardly, every time I see it. (See also why I can’t have the Tumblr, Vine, or Medium apps on the front page.)</p>
<p>I also quite dig that little Pocket icon, and enjoy seeing it on an extension in Safari, and appearing on tweets that feature links. Far more distinctive, in both cases, than a lone capital letter.</p>
<p>So, so very subjective but this round goes to: <strong>Pocket</strong></p>
<h3 id="web-ui">Web UI</h3>
<p>The article list in Pocket doesn’t quite get things right for me in either of its available formats. The tile view looks good, in the majority of cases, for items that feature an image—though sometimes the auto-cropping makes things messy—but pure text items kind of drown and the snippet of text that’s applied as a descriptor is often nonsensical. The list view is similarly short of ideas as to what to do about items without an image, and settles for putting an ugly placeholder next to them. At least the applied tags are visible in the list view however, whereas they’re inexplicably hidden in the tile layout.</p>
<p>The menus and iconography within the Pocket interface all err on the side of chunkiness. It’s all pretty clean, and the rounded human-sans type makes it seem friendly where Instapaper is more functional, but at times it feels a bit cumbersome - it allows itself too much space and feels inelegant for it. My biggest pet peeve is the occasional appearance of a big yellow button, clearly a hold over from the service’s previous incarnation as Read It Later, it just feels entirely out of place. I do, however, like the choice of a central menu that drops down from the logotype - it looks great and gives quick access to all of the service’s elements.</p>
<p>Where Pocket is blocky and colourful, Instapaper is stark in black &amp; white and (particularly in the ‘Compact’ iteration I prefer) makes great, functional use of every centimetre of screen space. No clumsily auto-generated snippet text, no mis-cropped images, just a crisp and functional UI with a familiar sidebar element. Though I have come to prefer tagging to folders as an organising principle, the folder implementation of Instapaper works well enough with the one exception that I wish filed items still remained in ‘Archive’, keeping that as a universal list of read items.</p>
<p>The iconography isn’t quite as good as Pocket’s, but it works, and the split between a sans serif face for UI items and a serif for content works exceptionally well. Perhaps Instapaper’s biggest advantage of all in this area though is the simple inclusion of an edit function. Allowing me to tweak an article title to my liking allows me to keep things nice and neat, especially important when archiving for future consultation.</p>
<p>Hands down this goes to <strong>Instapaper</strong></p>
<h3 id="app-ui">App UI</h3>
<p>Pocket’s formatting of its item list is more forgivable within the apps, where the pictures are smaller and items that don’t have them do not look as out of place. The tags are visible too! The slide-out main menu looks great and works well and the iconography is strong enough to make the ‘swipe left and choose an icon’ school of actions work flawlessly. Perhaps it’s my feeble brain, but still when I attempt this move within the Instapaper app I occasionally mistake the ‘Folder’ icon for ‘Archive’, and the ‘Archive’ icon proper for a non-existent ‘Print’ function.</p>
<p>In fact, Instapaper’s app UI is a backwards step, not allowing the ‘Compact’ view I prefer on the web, the mandatory couple of lines snipped from the body of the icon make things look busy and untidy. On iPad things are even worse: tile view is mandatory and personally I find it ugly as all heck.</p>
<p>In terms of pure looks, <strong>Pocket</strong> has the upper hand on iOS.</p>
<h3 id="reading-experience">Reading experience</h3>
<p>There’s really not much in this. On the web both services do a good job of delivering on their <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em>: they get out of the way and leave the screen to cleanly presented text. Pocket only features a binary choice with respect to typography: serif or sans-serif, but the sans that’s provided is pleasant enough on the eye, particularly on iOS. Instapaper has a slight upper hand by providing more options, including Lyon - perhaps my favourite face for longform, screen-based reading.</p>
<p>It’s a slight shame that the header bar is always present when viewing Pocket content on the web, but equally irritating is the habit of Instapaper’s header to fade eye-catchingly back into view as soon as one scrolls up a few pixels. It’s a tie on that score.</p>
<p>In fact overall it’s just about even, but I’ll give it to <strong>Instapaper</strong> by a nose just because Lyon is an option.</p>
<h3 id="feeds">Feeds</h3>
<p>This is a tricky one for me because I’m unusually sensitive to the underlying relationships between these read-later apps and other parts of my workflow.</p>
<p>Taking Instapaper first: the service is owned by Betaworks, who also operate the RSS reader service Digg Reader. To use one without the other seems counterintuitive to me, and yet Betaworks don’t make things easy. Perhaps hedging their bets they have retained a ‘save for later’ function within Digg Reader, as well as an Instapaper option. To further complicate things the option exists to automatically send to Instapaper any item that is marked to save for later. Not a huge deal perhaps, but it bugs me every time I encounter it and have to make a false choice.</p>
<p>Feedly has been my RSS service of choice since the demise of Google Reader, and its pro version professes close ties to both Pocket and Evernote. That sounds like the sort of airtight setup that holds a lot of appeal to me, but the reality is a little underwhelming… (see below)</p>
<p>In truth both Pocket &amp; Instapaper are fairly universal export options within most feed reading clients at this point, so it’s hard not to make this one <strong>a tie</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="note-taking--clipping">Note-taking / clipping</h3>
<p>Currently at least, Feedly &amp; Pocket’s vaunted close ties to Evernote extend exactly as far as the option to simply send the entire text of an article to a notebook of your choice. Ironically it’s Instapaper (not, to my knowledge, an Evernote ‘partner’) that has the more granular integration. With the recent addition of its ‘highlighting’ function, and the option to automatically send highlighted passages to Evernote, Instapaper makes for a very neat clipping tool. There’s still some tidying up to do on the Evernote end as each highlight comes through as a separate note regardless of whether several originate form the same item within Instapaper, but it’s a step in a very interesting direction and cuts out a bit of the work of having a separate app open into which to paste clipped passages.</p>
<p>Pocket doesn’t have anything like this… so it’s really down to the user to provide their own solution. Which is why, <strong>Instapaper</strong> takes this round.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h3>
<p>With folders or tagging, both services offer a decent device for maintaining an archive of read material. Still, I use a bookmarking service (Pinboard) for interesting sites and content of various stripes, and it’s nice to be able to have select content that has passed through my read-later service also be stored there. Instapaper has a setting whereby any item that gets ‘Liked’ gets sent on to Pinboard. For the most part this works exceptionally well, with the slight exception that the entry in Pinboard is marked as private without any option to change this. The vast majority of my Pinboard content is public, which means a little bit of curation is still needed on my part once ‘Liked’ Instapaper items make their way over there. There’s also the choice to send any given item to Pinboard manually without the need to ‘Like’ it.</p>
<p>Pocket doesn’t offer a solution to manually send items to Pinboard, or to automatically export ‘Favourite’ items. With a little <a href="http://www.ifttt.com"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->IFTTT<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> magic the latter can be replicated; there’s even the slight advantage of the item importing as public.</p>
<p>Related to this is the question of storing a full-text archive copy of items. Pocket recently introduced this for all items for users with a Premium subscription at $5 per month. An alternative is Pinboard’s archiving service at $25 per year, which does the same thing, but obviously only on items sent to it by one of the routes outlined above.</p>
<p>Again, there’s not much in this one but <strong>Instapaper</strong> edges it for the presence of an automatic <em>and</em> a manual solution.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>Instapaper</strong> 4.5
<strong>Pocket</strong> 2.5</p>
<p>That scoreline looks more one-sided than this feels to me. The things that bug me about Instapaper (the icon, the item list on iOS) really bug me and the things I like about Pocket (the iconography, the ties with Feedly) I really like. However, in a few key areas Instapaper has the upper hand: the web UI is flawless; the typography is stronger across all platforms.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main barrier to me fully embracing <em>Instapaper</em> as my read-later client of choice, is the extent to which I get hung up on the ideal of the holistic setup. If I’m using Instapaper it feels wrong to me not to be using Digg Reader as my RSS client, and that’s not a step I’m prepared to take. Likewise, if I’m to continue using Feedly for RSS, it feels like I should be utilising the other service it is most closely tied: Pocket (particularly as I’m a heavy user of the third piece of that touted puzzle: Evernote). I may consider switching my RSS to something like Feedbin to alleviate this, or I could try and get past it and embrace the decision to use the best tool for each particular job, regardless of who owns them.</p>

			 <p>Even if you’re not hugely into comics there’s a good chance you understand why you’ll never see Superman arm-wrestle Thor, or Batman and Iron Man having a conversation about who’s richer and has cooler gadgets. For the longest time there have been two major players in the world of comics publishing—Marvel &amp; DC—and in each of the above examples the two characters fall on either side of that divide. <em>The Avengers</em> brings together multiple Marvel characters, and the upcoming <em>Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> will see DC’s two titans on the same screen, but never the twain shall meet.</p>
<p>What might be less clear however, is why certain Marvel characters never seem to run into each other on the silver screen. The Avengers movie, and the solo adventures of all its constituent members (plus the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->S.H.I.E.L.D.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> TV show), are happening in one continuity. It’s fun to watch that universe grow, and look for cameos and references across the films, but to a fan of the comics it’s frustratingly obvious to see the film-makers run up against the limits of what they are permitted to show or even reference. Put simply, it’s a drag to know you’ll never see any two of Hulk, Wolverine and Spider-Man in the same frame.</p>
<p>The mystical force that keeps these universes separate is something more powerful than the Infinity Gauntlet, or the Tesseract, and far more insidious even than the Aether… it’s the immutable power of copyright law! Whilst Marvel owns all the rights to the use of its characters in print and on TV, the film rights are a different and more complicated story. Believe it or not there was a time in the distant and murky past (the 1990s) when superhero movies were not a permanent fixture of the box office. The Batman movies of the day were unsuccessful both as action films and in the camp comedy they reached for, and <em>Jurassic Park</em> (1993) and <em>Independence Day</em> (1996) set the templates for the summer blockbuster. It was in this climate that Marvel began selling movie rights to its characters. Spider-Man went to Sony, X-Men went to Fox, and both grew successful franchises out of what they had bought. So successful in fact that Marvel took the decision to begin producing their own films based on the properties they retained, beginning with <em>Iron Man</em> (2008).</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Avi Arad and Kevin Feige, the series of films that introduced Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, and then assembled them for <em>Marvel’s The Avengers</em> (2012) has become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series">second highest-grossing film franchise in history</a>. Now well into its ‘<a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/05/02/iron-man-3-marvel-phase-two/">Phase Two</a>’ and with releases allegedly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/04/marvel-movie-masterplan-2028-president-kevin-feigle-comic-book">planned as far ahead as 2028</a> Marvel’s Cinematic Universe has become as reliable and regular a source of entertainment as the comics themselves.</p>
<p>However, having struck deals for licensing out some of their most popular characters, Marvel—acquired by Disney in 2009—find themselves in a strange position: for all of the epic, dimension-hopping scale of their film series there remain some simple things they cannot do. Things, I’m willing to bet, many of their creatives dearly want to do. The relationship between Spider-Man and Hulk is long-running comic book gold, and it probably stings the writers as much as the fans that we don’t get to see it on screen. It probably makes the accountants weep too; think how much money an X-Men / Avengers cross-over would make! Who wouldn’t want to see what happens if Iron Man runs into Magneto?</p>
<p>But it’s not just the inconvenience - we’re now starting to see the fragmentation of these universes. The character of Quicksilver, seemingly unanimously considered the highlight of Bryan Singer’s <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em> (2014), is also glimpsed at the end of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> (2014). The concepts for the character in each case are clearly different, they’re played by different actors, and what happens to one will have no bearing on what happens to the other. This is seemingly permissible by a quirk of the agreement Marvel has with Fox: Quicksilver (and his sister Scarlet Witch) are the children of Magneto, and therefore part of the X-Men continuity owned by Fox, but both—in print—have served as long-term members of the Avengers and hence are fair game for on-screen use by Marvel. With <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> releasing in 2015, and <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> hitting screens in 2016, the two competing versions of Quicksilver are likely to prove somewhat confusing to moviegoing audiences. Good luck explaining copyright law to the seven year-old who doesn’t understand why one Quicksilver hangs out with Wolverine and the other isn’t even allowed to say his name.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible, of course, that this tangle can be undone. If enough money changes hands we could yet see a cinematic conceit bring together characters from the separate universes. So the idea that we might one day see a Hulk &amp; Wolverine <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Glossary:Fastball_Special">fastball special</a> isn’t completely dead, but I wouldn’t hold my breath… unless I was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namor">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>… the <a href="http://screenrant.com/hulk-3-sequels-universal-owns-namor-rights/">rights to whom seem to be with Universal Studios</a>, along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_the_Duck">Howard the Duck</a>. So there’s your next big team-up blockbuster I guess.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s not the big ideas at work in <em>Incognito</em> that hook you; they’re swirling in there, amidst the cast of variously-accented characters, the parallel plots of brain theft, sexual identity, and memory loss, but–fittingly–they&rsquo;re only a <em>part</em> of the play&rsquo;s make-up. It’s the emotional truth of it that sticks the landing.</p>
<p>Loss is the currency that most of these stories trade in: loss of memory, but also loss of identity (in more than one manner), loss of certainty, loss of control. Nick Payne&rsquo;s play works to keep the ground beneath its characters constantly shifting. There is no surety here in a life&rsquo;s work, or in a lifetime&rsquo;s self-perception. Like memory itself Payne shows us through overlaid examples that everything we know and cherish (including our selves) is a gestalt of ceaselessly shifting pieces; infinitesimal, unknowable elements that comprise life at the scale we recognise it. What happens when we are, knowingly or unknowingly, confronted with that reality is the crucible of <em>Incognito</em>. That the play draws poignancy and humour from this difficult place is testament to a finely balanced text and some truly astounding performances.</p>
<p>Accents are the shortcut to understanding which of the half-dozen or so characters played by each actor is before you at any one time, but the art goes deeper  - each incarnation imbued with a unique posture and set of mannerisms. The retinue brought to life by Sargon Yelda in particular runs the gamut from broadly comic to authentically haunted. It&rsquo;s a dizzying masterclass and breathtaking to behold.</p>
<p>The staging also has its own tics. The brief transitions between scenes swell here with piano and there with birdsong - the chatter of starlings that form the play&rsquo;s central metaphor: persons and lifetimes as the temporary arrangements of circumstance. There is no explicit nod to it in his play, but it makes one wonder whether Payne has any interest in or affinity for Buddhist thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our brains are constantly, exhaustively working overtime to deliver the illusion that we’re in control, but we’re not. The brain builds a narrative to steady us from moment to moment, but it&rsquo;s ultimately an illusion. There is no me, there is no you, and there certainly is no self; we are divided and discontinuous and constantly being duped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Buddha and Payne&rsquo;s Martha Murphy agree, and it&rsquo;s perhaps this that made <em>Incognito</em> feel a warm play to me where it might also be open to the allegation of pessimism about the human condition: the narrative construction retains the courage of its conviction, and bears out the truth that fleeting beauty is no less beautiful.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/18/5629544/nike-reportedly-abandons-the-fuelband-and-lays-off-its-hardware">The news this morning</a> that Nike is effectively exiting the wearable tech market — letting go the bulk of the team behind the Nike+ FuelBand, SportWatch GPS etc. — might seem surprising when every other company is talking up wearables as the next big thing, but it’s a move I’ve been anticipating for a little while.</p>
<p>The demise of the FuelBand in particular is a shame. Since launch it has been an incomparable piece of design in an increasingly crowded market. It did one thing, and from the hardware to the UI of the accompanying app, it did it superbly. When I was first considering getting a FuelBand 18 months ago I was persuaded as much by <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/nike-fuelband">design blogs</a> as tech sites. The original FuelBand was a wonderful piece of minimal design, and last year’s release of the FuelBand SE made some meaningful changes to further perfect it.</p>
<p>It’ll be a shame to see the FuelBand go away, but it’s not a shock. Even when I was looking for a way to track my activity, back in January 2013, the NikeTown employee talking me through my options said that the company’s push was towards the (free) app for iOS. It might seem counterintuitive that instead of trying to sell me a £120 piece of wristwear, Nike was pushing use of an app they don’t make money off. But the latter has two added values: first, there is no manufacturing cost; and second, the app encourages engagement with the NikeFuel community. At a basic level more user engagement means more opportunity to advertise to users, and it’s far easier for Nike to try and sell me some new shoes via the iOS app, than it is via a dot-matrix display on my wrist. The app is a cheaper, easier way to keep me engaged in the Nike ecosystem.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: even if FuelBands stopped rolling off the production line tomorrow, NikeFuel is here to stay. The company’s proprietary unit for measuring activity is baked into every tech venture they’ve launched in the last couple of years and has increasingly been the focus of a lot of their marketing. From software releases like <em><a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training">Nike+ Kinect Training</a></em> for Xbox, and any one of the half-dozen Nike apps in the iTunes App Store (to track running, basketball, your training regimen…), to the recently revamped <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com">Nike+ website</a>, to the API made publicly available in January 2013, it’s clear that NikeFuel isn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>So why abandon the hardware effort? For the past couple of years the tech world has anticipated the advent of wearables as the next big market after smartphones and then tablets. For various reasons, however, the market for smartwatches will never be as lucrative as the one for portable, general-purpose computing, communication, and entertainment devices: the hardware will retail at a significantly lower price than tablets and phones, will likely require a smartphone to be present to make full use of their most interesting features, and will appeal in the first place to a smaller segment of the population than carries a phone. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/think_wearables_are_the_next_tech_boom_think_again/">The predicted $30 billion market for wearables by 2018</a> is dwarfed even by current iPhone &amp; iPad sales alone. There’s no question that Nike will want a front-and-centre presence when wearable tech becomes mainstream, but being one device among many competing for the consumer pound is likely not an exciting prospect for a company which now has a few years’ experience of the overhead cost of producing these devices.</p>
<p>Recently I started to wonder whether it wouldn’t make sense for Nike+ to be baked into whatever device Apple ends up releasing. It would benefit Apple enormously not to have to build their own movement tracking suite, and it would be a win for Nike to be on the wrist of everyone who buys Apple’s product. This relationship goes back quite some way: the 5th gen iPod nano, released in 2009, had a non-deletable Nike+ app built right in - a trend that has continued to the current generations of the device, and spread also to the iPod Touch and the aforementioned clutch of apps in the App Store. When the iPhone 5S was revealed, with the M7 motion co-processor dedicated solely to motion-tracking, it was the Nike+ Move app - launched alongside the device - that first took advantage of the new technology. Furthermore Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has been a member of the Nike Board of Directors since 2005 and is in an excellent position to know which way the wind is shifting with respect to the wearables ecosystem. He’s also been <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1672688/apple-s-tim-cook-on-why-the-nike-fuelband-works-and-google-glass-doesn-t">a vocal proponent</a> of the FuelBand’s value, and with that in mind, though this may be the end of the FuelBand as a standalone device, I fully expect that Apple’s eventual smartwatch will incorporate a large part of what Nike have built (software &amp; community) at system level.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today, 13 April, would have been Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s birthday. Back in 2006, on the centenary of his birth, I was fortunate enough to be at Reading University – home of the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/sc-beckett.aspx">Beckett International Collection</a> – and it was under those circumstances that my relationship with the work of one of the 20th Century&rsquo;s most interesting and influential writers began.</p>
<p>I like to mark Beckett&rsquo;s birthday in some small way: whether it&rsquo;s reading a couple of the poems or watching something from the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckett_on_Film">Beckett on Film</a> collection. This year, however, there was something a bit special on offer: the recent publication of &lsquo;Echo&rsquo;s Bones&rsquo;, a short story written in 1934 and heretofore unpublished. Beckett wrote the ~13,500 word story at the request of his published Chatto &amp; Windus, who were looking to add a final piece to the collection <em>More Pricks Than Kicks</em> to make the slim volume a more substantial offering. The piece that Beckett turned in was rejected as &lsquo;a nightmare&rsquo; that &lsquo;would depress the sales very considerably&rsquo;, and it has existed for the last 80 years in the form of a single typescript and one carbon copy.</p>
<p>As part of its excellent work on the Beckett catalogue since the centenary Faber &amp; Faber this month published the story in a hardback edition. The text itself is dense, allusive, and difficult, and suffers from the odd predicament of having a protagonist whom Beckett had killed off in the final story of <em>More Pricks Than Kicks</em>. Even with the benefit of hindsight (and thus knowledge of the work Beckett would go on to write and gain notoriety for) a modern reader sympathises with Charles Prentice of Chatto &amp; Windus, who found himself rejecting a story that &lsquo;gives me the jim-jams&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Presented on its own, without the accompanying pieces of the collection it was intended to conclude, the text would likely be entirely impenetrable without the concise introduction and precise annotation it&rsquo;s given here by editor Dr. Mark Nixon. As it happens Nixon was my Beckett tutor at Reading, and it was a pleasure to spend Beckett&rsquo;s birthday not just with a text that was new to me, but benefitting once more from Mark&rsquo;s guidance.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m just done watching <em>Everybody Street</em>, a 2013 doc by Cheryl Dunn about the practice of street photography in general, and in particular the development of the artform over several decades in New York.</p>
<p>Dunn’s method is to present a series of photographers in turn, explore their methods, their motivations, and their work. The result is a neat mosaic of some strikingly different personalities, all drawn to turn lenses on the city they call home. Enjoyable as these pieces are, it may have profited the film to have had some dialogue between the various practitioners: to find out what they each think about what makes the others tick. There’s enough for the viewer to piece together where their various interests overlap or diverge, but in holding to the format of presenting one photographer at a time a conversation never develops between them; it feels a little like we’re seeing the surface of a dozen lives at the expense of really coming to understand any one.</p>
<p>If that seems uncharitable it is likely I was spoiled a little by 2010’s <em>Bill Cunningham, New York</em>: a remarkable documentary working similar territory, the magic of which comes when the film moves past Bill Cunningham as photographer and becomes interested in the man. If Dunn’s project here is solely to give an overview of New York street photography it is very well accomplished. That I came away with a list of names to look up, wanting to know more about some of the snappers than the film allows time for, can be read as either a positive or a negative.</p>

			 <p>There’s a tightness between my shoulder blades like some stubborn knot, and a weakness in my knees which feel creaky and slow. Worst of all though is my lower spine and my hips: that whole section of my torso feels fused and unyielding, every movement I ask of it is torturous, and sitting, standing, or lying still is worse.</p>
<p>How have I been reduced to this lumbering, graceless, pain-racked thing? Am I in the latter stages of recovery from a horrific motorbike accident? Perhaps my body has been invaded by some especially virulent strain of influenza: swine, avian, homunculus? No, and no - this is all because I didn’t have a cup of coffee this morning, or the last couple of days. Caffeine has been a habit for more than half of my life, and I thought it might be interesting to find out exactly what role it plays for me by cutting it out for Lent.</p>
<p>Day one I developed a headache: a persistent, dull throb behind my left eye which spread to the top of my skull. I’d been expecting that—anyone with a regular coffee habit will tell you that headaches are quite common if you skip your morning cup—and I’d stockpiled ibuprofen to help. It didn’t alleviate the headache entirely, but it kept it at a low ebb as it stayed resident through the afternoon, and the evening, and the morning of the next day. <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199210153271601">More then half of people who quit caffeine get this</a>, and it was tough not to just go get a macchiato to make it stop.</p>
<p>I was also looking out for irritability and low mood, both of which I definitely noticed creeping in as the day wore on. That evening my girlfriend and I were trying to plan a trip and I found myself unable to concentrate on the details of travel arrangements and hotel rooms, disinterested, and yet annoyed at the lack of progress in our planning. I was also struggling to stay awake. At 8pm that first evening I had my eyes closed through most of an episode of <em>House of Cards</em>, and I was in bed by 9.30pm totally exhausted.</p>
<p>My energy levels bounced back the second day, though the headache continued - in total it lasted somewhere just short of 48 hours. I was also finding myself feeling really hungry earlier in the day than I normally would, and more quickly after eating. I started to regain the ability to concentrate, and my mood lifted, both of which I was thankful for, but the worst symptom yet started to come on in the afternoon of day two and is still with me as I type this on the morning of day four: the kind of pervasive musculoskeletal pain you’d normally associate with flu. I couldn’t get comfortable in my office chair, people looked at me weird when I tried to stretch out my hamstrings in corridors. Sitting meditation that evening was almost fruitless: although my mind was fairly calm the level of discomfort I was in on the cushion was too distracting.</p>
<p>Here on the morning of day four I’m convinced the headache is a thing of the past and I’m free of psychological symptoms, all that remains to fight off is this chronic aching. Painkillers don’t seem to be doing much, so all I have for solace is the fact that all of the articles I’ve read on the subject say that symptoms persist for a week at most.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324904004578537263312778902">Caffeine withdrawal is now listed in the DSM5</a> as a mental disorder, because its effects are severe enough to impair everyday functioning. If I had read that a week ago I may have found it difficult to believe, but just coming down from ~4 cups of coffee a day to none has been a real wake-up-call. It’s been a genuine shock to find out how dependent I was on caffeine for baseline normal function. It leaves me with a tough question about whether, once Easter rolls around, I renew my coffee habit. I enjoy coffee, I miss it, but I’m not sure how I feel about allowing a drug to have that much power over me.</p>

			 <p>David Foster Wallace was a writer who made other writers look plain lazy. The labyrinthine sentence construction for which he became known, and the sometimes unreasonable-seeming depths of his interrogations into just how the pieces fit together, were the hallmarks of a thinker whose horizons of interest were panoramic, and who felt and thought intensely about all aspects of his life and work.</p>
<p>Wallace was also a human being who made others of us seem small-hearted and incurious by comparison. The compassion in which all of his work (fiction &amp; non-fiction) is rooted, and the thirst for understanding by which he was motivated, remain both sadly rare and powerfully inspirational.</p>
<p>To face the world as honestly as Wallace did, and to attempt explication of its boundless mysteries through the tireless employment of all the wattage of the human brain and the human heart combined, are aspirations with which we are left to wrestle. That he supplied some dispatches from that place—hand-drawn maps formed of beautiful, dizzying, acrobatic, or else origami-like sentences—remains our good fortune.</p>

			 <p>In a disused former Royal Mail sorting office next to Paddington Station something strange and wonderful is happening. The shell of the building has been resurrected, and exists now (at least temporarily) in a patchwork of guises: a 1960s Los Angeles film studio; a stretch of woodland populated with caravans; the setting of a desert funeral, its unmoving attendees stuffed with straw. These environs, meticulously realised and possessed of the unsettling ability to shift one-into-another, are the set of <a href="http://www.punchdrunk.com">Punchdrunk</a>’s <em>The Drowned Man</em>, an epic work of promenade theatre employing a cast of 32 to tell numerous intertwining stories over three head-spinning hours.<br>

</p>
<p>I’ve never experienced anything quite like <em>The Drowned Man</em>. During my time wandering inside it a number of other works of art in various media came to mind: David Lynch is an obvious touchstone (perhaps particularly 2006’s <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>) for the tonal sense of magic hour dread; there is something akin to the feeling of being lost in the collapsing text of Danielewski’s byzantine novel <em>House of Leaves</em> (2000); some video games have begun to stretch into this off-kilter experiential realm, such as <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> (both 2013). Ultimately, however, this intricately constructed piece of immersive performance art is powerful in ways that those other media cannot approximate.</p>
<p>The strength of theatre is the fact of it being live, happening before you within parameters of time and space which it creates for itself. Punchdrunk’s reputation is for refiguring those parameters so as to include the audience as a vital axis of the story’s telling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Punchdrunk is about empowering the audience. The more curious they are, the more they are rewarded.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/punchdrunk-to-stage-major-production-in-london-this-summer">Felix Barrett</a> (Artistic Director, Punchdrunk)</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Upon arrival at a performance of <em>The Drowned Man</em> visitors are instructed to be silent for the duration of the show, and are issued with a mask. It does not take long for these simple things to radically alter one’s experience. To have become one of hundreds wearing an identical white visage, and to be tasked with nothing more than moving silently, is equal parts liberating and unsettling. This is the skewed starting point from which your journey branches - and no two will be alike.</p>
<p>The experience of voyeurism is a powerfully odd thing. You might find yourself one of a handful of white masks in a hotel room, watching someone do their make-up. You may be alone in the diner, reading the menu or the pin-board full of notes by the telephone whilst the waitress polishes glasses, seemingly oblivious to your presence. It doesn’t take long to get used to being a ghost.</p>
<p>One of the more Lynchian moments I witnessed was a dancer auditioning on a checkerboard stage. To her mind her audience is one seated individual who sits in a leather chair sipping from a tumbler. In fact, however, she is surrounded by more than a hundred of us, white masks lined up in silence and stillness not just in front of the stage but to the side, and even from the back.</p>
<p>During my visit I was witness to a few of these set pieces. As you wander the labyrinthine sets you often catch sight of an unmasked face, or hear a voice around some corner and know that you have stumbled across some unfolding moment - a piece of the larger story. Many audience members tend to latch on to a character and follow them from scene to scene, perhaps switching to another character if the fancy takes them, all the the while shining a little more light on the arcs of these presented lives. Some of my favourite moments came in the wake of those scenes, after the audience had moved on - lingering in the empty section of set and examine its contents: read handwritten notes from one character to another, look through the press clippings a starlet has chosen to deface, peruse a collection of props neatly arranged and labelled in glass cabinets. Even wandering in this relatively aimless manner I came across a line dance, a drowning, an overdose… and many more. One of the few things I knew of the show before attending was to be wary of its scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember there is always one more floor than you think there is. I thought it was quite an experience, and one with moments of real jaw-dropping wonder.</p>
<p>— <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/jul/19/punchrunk-hype-drowned-man-lyn-gardner">Lyn Gardner</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a visitor you are quickly relieved of the idea that you will be able to take in all that <em>The Drowned Man</em> has to offer. I seemed to spend the first 45 minutes on a single floor, and even then without venturing into some of its corners. A cinema, a drug store, a bar, hotel rooms…. The moment of arriving to another floor and setting foot on sand for the first time was a small revelation to me: there were worlds contained here, and without intention or comprehension I had penetrated some barrier. It felt like this from one level to the next: from the soaring tress of the wood-chip floored forest to the depths of the basement with its heavy doors that close with an unsettling finality, leaving you in tiny rooms of authentic dankness, lone props on pedestals your only company.</p>
<p>By virtue of its sheer size there are corners of these worlds that feel untouched - places you find yourself in alone. I had this experience in a room behind a curtain where a reel-to-reel tape intoned the voice of studio director Leland Stanford giving directions for what turned out to be a scene I would witness play out later on. Or at least, I believe it was later. The flow of time inside the world of the work seems disrupted. There are two stories playing out (at least, not to mention the innumerable, equally fascinating attendant narratives with which they touch), and your experience of them is dictated by your choice of how to move about the world Punchdrunk has created. “Tonight your bearing shapes your fate” as Stanford informs / warns you as you enter. You catch moments, run into characters, hear things in the distance wreathed in all of that fog, and you’re able to put some of it together. But what happened to whom and when, and why… these questions will likely remain unanswered when you emerge blinking into the London streets a few hours later feeling changed.</p>
<p>Whilst it wears film as a badge of influence, the piece takes joy in the freedom of eschewing that medium’s conventions of sequential narrative structure. Even the most well-realised world of the novel cannot supply the sensory experience of wandering around unguided, immersed in a truly altered reality, at liberty to inspect any of its minutiae that you choose. The closest experience perhaps is to be found in the realm of video games, where narrative can move at the player’s pace and exploratory freedom is accepted as the determining factor of the world-building enterprise. Even then, however, efforts will always fall short of the incomparable fidelity of this masterfully realised performance space, and the immaculate work of the players within it.</p>

<p>It’s about a heightened state of awareness.</p>

<p>If I hadn’t been convinced of the work’s singular brilliance by the <em>sui generis</em> experience of wandering within <em>The Drowned Man</em> as a whole, I most certainly was by one moment in particular. At one point I found myself at the back of a large group of white masks looking on as a dance number was filmed on one of the studio’s sets. I could hardly see anything and resorted to waiting in a hallway to see how the crowd would disperse. As I did so the character of The Seamstress walked past me and disappeared into a nearby doorway.  Provoked by curiosity, and secure in my status as a phantom, I followed and found her attending to racks of costumes in the studio’s wardrobe department. I took to examining the room and was poking at shelves filled with shoes when she approached, looked me straight in the eye, and held out her hand. I had been a ghost for 90 minutes by this time, and this simple gesture so completely altered my perception of the role I was playing within the world of the performance that it took a few seconds and a raise of her eyebrows before I comprehended what was being asked of me. Taking The Seamstress’s hand I was led to a dressing room, the door to which she quickly locked behind us. Once we were alone she spoke to me, instructing me to sit, then to come closer, and then telling me that she was going to get me ready for my “next big scene”. She performed another simple action that again had the effect of changing my whole experience: she removed my mask and set it aside as she began to tell me what was needed - “a little to the eyes, something to the lips”. She took up a pinch of some substance from the make-up tray and began to rub it into my lips, all the time telling me that I reminded her of someone: of “the first painted queen”. Adding dabs of something black to the corners of my eyes she told me how people had said the queen had “promise in her lips, or poison”, and taking hold of my face she told me “but you know which it is don’t you?”. As whatever she had rubbed into my lips began to warm and tingle, The Seamstress turned my head so that I saw myself in the mirror for the first time, and as I did so the image changed revealing a face made of twigs.</p>
<p>These few minutes, behind a locked door, revealed to me the power of Punchdrunk’s art. The timing of it, how the music was made to crescendo at the correct moment, and how the special effect was triggered are parts of a mystery I have little interest in solving. The experience, to be that close to a performance, to be the only one being performed to, and what’s more to remain utterly convinced of it—to find not a hint of a crack in the artifice—was absolutely unlike any other interaction I have ever had with a work of art, and nothing short of astounding.<br>

<p>I haven’t been willing or able to put <em>The Drowned Man</em> out of my head since seeing it, and my post-show experience is characterised by contradictions. Many of the sets were so beautifully constructed and so richly detailed that I longed to be able to capture some of the images; at the same time, however, I’m keenly aware that the experience would have been greatly diminished by the permission to do so. Hundreds of ghosts with camera-phones would quickly dispel the show’s magical atmosphere. Similarly I am compelled by the concept of recreating that world, its characters and rhythms, in the form of a digital replica in which I would have unlimited time to walk around and make new discoveries. Yet, conversely, I’m in love with the mystery of the piece; the very fact of my experience’s incompleteness has a powerful romantic pull.</p>
<p>A few more hours in that awe inspiring place couldn’t hurt, however, and if the <a href="https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/plans-to-extend-punchdrunks-drowned-man-to-end-of-2014">planned extension of the run</a> goes ahead, I’ll certainly want to revisit Temple Studios.</p>

			 <p>Unlike movies, music, books, and even AAA games, one of the beauties of the App Store system (for all of its flaws) is that often you don’t know when an app is coming, if it’s coming, or when it’ll be updated. There’s always the prospect that, on any given day, you might learn about something incredible that just materialised, or that one of your favourite apps might get a surprise new feature.</p>
<p>The flip side of that capricious coin is that occasionally you catch talk about an app in advance, and end up waiting in perpetuity for a release that never comes. The buzz persists, the promise is there, but there’s no way to know whether the project will ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>Here are notes on three apps that I’ve had that experience with:</p>
<h3 id="hexxis">Hexxis</h3>
<p>FORMation Alliance was one of the first iOS developers whose sense of style struck me hard enough that I was excited for every new project they released. The minimal, well-organised interfaces of typography-based game <em>Kern</em>, and two-player colour-match contest <em>Eye vs Eye</em> (both outlined in this <a href="https://coolhunting.com/tech/formation-iphon/">Coolhunting article</a>) had me hooked; another type-centric offering — <em>Press Check</em> — was smart but flawed, and five-part storytelling experiment <em>Treehouse</em> was an interesting precursor to projects like Simogo’s <a href="https://simogo.com/work/device-6/"><em>Device 6</em></a>.</p>
<p>Of all of FORMation’s projects however, <em>Hexxis</em> was the one I was the most excited about. With each release the studio was getting stronger, making really interesting advances, and the teaser video for this puzzle game looked like the culmination of all of that:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/8796303" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="vimeo video" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></p>
<p>There are many aspects to <em>Hexxis</em> that appeal to me: the neatness of its geometry, its striking colour palate, the seeming simplicity of its ruleset. Before the game saw release however, FORMation ceased to be. Designer Jason Franzen went on to form new studio <a href="http://www.moresimple.com">More Simple</a>, where <em>Hexxis</em> at least lives on as a project page<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but that ‘Coming Soon’ badge has now been attached to the game for more than four years.</p>
<h3 id="nizo">Nizo</h3>
<p>It was around the time that Instagram was starting to pick up a lot of traffic that I started to see talk on Twitter about an app named <em>Nizo</em>. The premise was a video app that would bring new life to the 8mm film aesthetic. That sounded cool enough, and then there was the fact that Nizo had simply the best <a href="https://www.nizo.co">teaser page</a> I’d ever seen. That page still ends with ‘Coming to the App Store’, and a semi-active <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nizo">Twitter account</a> still hints tantalisingly at progress now and again. The big question for <em>Nizo</em> is whether the radical UI changes that came with iOS 7 have meant a re-think of the app. I’m still cautiously optimistic that it may someday see release.</p>
<h3 id="scoundrel">Scoundrel</h3>
<p>This is the big one.</p>
<p>Zach Gage (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/helvetica">@helvetica</a>) is one of my absolute favourite developers working on iOS: <a href="http://www.spelltower.com"><em>Spelltower</em></a> alone makes him a rock star, and he also has work like <a href="http://www.bitpilotgame.com"><em>Bit Pilot</em></a> and the under-appreciated <a href="http://www.unifygame.com"><em>Unify</em></a> in his extensive back catalogue, as well as great conceptual pieces like <a href="http://www.stfj.net/art/2009/loselose/"><em>Lose/Lose</em></a>. Alongside <a href="http://www.vlambeer.com">Vlambeer</a> he made one of the best iOS game of 2013 in the shape of <a href="http://www.ridiculousfishing.com"><em>Ridiculous Fishing</em></a> - and those are just some select picks from his extensive portfolio (check it out at his site <a href="http://www.stfj.net">stfj.net</a>- you’ll need to scroll!).</p>
<p>One game missing from that list is <em>Scoundrel</em>:  a super-inventive card-based roguelike with a twist. From the first buzz on <em>Scoundrel</em> I’ve been aching to try it out. There have been favourable comparisons to iOS classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_7"><em>Drop7</em></a> in terms of sheer addictive appeal, which seemed to be justified on the evidence of a five minute <a href="https://vimeo.com/30717174">preview video</a> uploaded to Vimeo. It seemed for a while that all of the indie game folks I follow in Twitter were talking about the game; Doug Wilson of Die Gute Fabrik picked an early build of <em>Scoundrel</em> as his <a href="http://gutefabrik.com/blog/?p=1064">favourite game of 2011</a>, all of which had this at the top of my wish list for ages.</p>
<p>As it stands this Hookshot preview<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> in February 2012, is the last news I’ve seen on the game. Gage was wrapped up with <em>Ridiculous Fishing</em> and has since been hard at work on some really interesting tabletop games like <a href="http://www.gutsofglorygame.com"><em>Guts of Glory</em></a> and <a href="http://stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2013/Grit.pdf"><em>Grit</em></a>. The current status of <em>Scoundrel</em> is uncertain. As with <em>Hexxis</em>, my guess — and it is just a guess — is that once the mechanics were in place and working the balancing and building out of the game posed some unforeseen challenges. I’m sure that’s the way of game development as with any creative project, and for whatever reason Gage’s mind turned to other projects.</p>
<p>I’m not quite ready to write off <em>Scoundrel</em> as completely dead just yet. It remains one project among many for a talented and prolific developer who currently has other priorities. All signs pointed to <em>Scoundrel</em> being something really special, and maybe we’ll never find out… but just maybe, someday, we will.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-roly-porter--life-cycle-of-a-massive-star">20. Roly Porter — <em>Life Cycle of a Massive Star</em></h3>
<p>I listened to and loved a lot of electronic music this year, from danceable stuff like Gesaffelstein’s <em>Aleph</em> and Four Tet’s <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> down to more experimental work like this. Porter’s ~35 minute album is a musical exploration of how a celestial body forms, exists, and decays; it’s probably best considered a single piece of music and it’s for this reason that a pretty incredible album is so low on the list: I just haven’t managed to sit down and listen to it start-to-finish more than a couple of times. When I have though, particularly through good headphones, it’s stunning.</p>
<h3 id="19-pantha-du-prince--the-bell-laboratory--elements-of-light">19. Pantha du Prince &amp; The Bell Laboratory — <em>Elements of Light</em></h3>
<p>Another relatively short electronic album with a physics-based title. <em>Elements of Light</em> is more easily digestible than Porter’s record, and is based around a fascinating interplay between minimal electronica and a whole suite of bells played by the Norwegian ensemble The Bell Laboratory. This came out all the way back in January and must be one of my most listened to albums of 2013, but the way these two constituent elements play around and interact with each other never got tired for me.</p>
<h3 id="18-surfer-blood--pythons">18. Surfer Blood — <em>Pythons</em></h3>
<p>Hark! Guitars! And what a joyful racket Surfer Blood make on their second LP. To my ear this recalls mid-90s Weezer crossed with just a touch of something from the millennial New York scene of The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs etc. There’s nothing surprising here if you listened to their first album (and EP) as many times as I did, but there is so much to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. A dozen three-minute pop gems that vary in emotional tonality around the same bases as all my favourite emo / bubblegum bands of the past (shout out to That Dog!). Surfer Blood’s secret weapon, it should be noted, is John Paul Pitts’s voice: unusually tuneful and rich, but also capable of a Frank Black-esque scream if required.</p>
<h3 id="17-shigeto--no-better-time-than-now">17. Shigeto — <em>No Better Time Than Now</em></h3>
<p>I came to Shigeto via a project by photographer Tim Navis in which several artists across various disciplines (video, photography, music&hellip;) took a trip to and around Iceland capturing their thoughts and experiences. That was enough to put this guy on my radar, and when Ghostly International put out this album - an immaculate set of spacious and contemplative electronica with some jazz influences - in August I was all over it. It’s been spinning regularly ever since.</p>
<h3 id="16-jon-hopkins--immunity">16. Jon Hopkins — <em>Immunity</em></h3>
<p>A blend of dance and more avant-garde melodic composition, <em>Immunity</em> is a very difficult album to categorise. In places it’s quite trancy and heavy, and then it’ll break for a meditative interlude and allow piano notes to linger amid a weighted silence. After dozens of listens I can’t entirely work out how such dramatic shifts are made to feel like a whole piece, but this remains one of the albums I’d recommend if someone was looking for an instrumental record from 2013.</p>
<h3 id="15-local-natives--hummingbird">15. Local Natives — <em>Hummingbird</em></h3>
<p>To my mind the sound of Local Natives is centred on Taylor Rice’s vocals: there’s a quiet melancholy there that sets the pace, and then thoughtful, spacious composition, and not- too-warm production paint the rest of the picture. There are some wonderfully emotive moments such as the quietly heartbreaking refrain of “you gave, and gave, and gave, and gave” in ‘Colombia’ that really struck a true chord for me, and tracks like ‘Ceilings’ that felt like perfect walking around music in spring and then again in autumn. A new band to me, I’ll be keeping an eye out for what follows next.</p>
<h3 id="14-queens-of-the-stone-age--like-clockwork">14. Queens of the Stone Age — <em>&hellip;Like Clockwork</em></h3>
<p>It was immediately apparent to me, only a couple of tracks into my first listen, that this was the QotSA album I’d been waiting for since 2002. I’m not sure how, but Homme et al have managed to recapture pretty near all the magic that seemed to have ebbed away over the last decade, and perhaps even more perplexingly, they make it sound effortless. At their best Queens combine a sense of genuine menace and darkness with an irresistibly catchy edge. Often that dichotomy is presented in an even split between guitars and the rhythm section respectively, with Homme’s incomparable vocals snaking their way somewhere through the middle ground. They don’t really put a foot wrong across these 10 tracks and it feels great to have them back at full strength.</p>
<h3 id="13-mikal-cronin--mcii">13. Mikal Cronin — <em>MCII</em></h3>
<p>I didn’t know Mikal Cronin at the start of the year and tuned into this album on the strength of a great review I happened across upon its release in May. Not wishing to be reductive but this record fit perfectly into the gap left by the absence of a Ben Kweller album this year. It is built of the same stuff (pop-rock roots, folk-leanings, garage rock with a seriously melodic underpinning) and executed with the same verve, energy, and colour. There’s nothing too complex here, Cronin wears his heart on his sleeve musically, and has made an album that you feel like you’re intimately familiar with by about the third listen through.</p>
<h3 id="12-paramore--paramore">12. Paramore — <em>Paramore</em></h3>
<p>It’s no surprise that I have a soft spot for Paramore - they’re hitting a lot of the emo buttons I have wired up from years of listening to Jimmy Eat World and Jenny Lewis, whilst at the same time crafting huge singalong pop-rock that the Biffy Clyro / Foo Fighters listening part of me is still in love with. At 17 tracks this album is perhaps a little overlong considering the breadth of what is on offer, but I’ve played it a lot and the majority of it is pretty great. ‘Still Into You’ is unashamedly on the shortlist for songs of the year because at heart I’m a 15 year old girl.</p>
<h3 id="11-holden--the-inheritors">11. Holden — <em>The Inheritors</em></h3>
<p>This set of endlessly inventive electronica ranges from complex &amp; heavy rhythms to lighter and more playful fare that recalls chiptune artists like Disasterpeace. James Holden can get pretty far out there, and his use of glitch and dissonance on some tracks makes for an uneven, if consistently interesting, listening experience. Not everything here is easy to love, but I’ve found myself being drawn in more and more over repeated listens. Once I felt I could trust Holden to make smart choices in his composition I started to really get into a lot of what is on offer here. If you can give yourself over to it, it’s an enormously rewarding record.</p>
<h3 id="10-dawn-of-midi--dysnomia">10. Dawn of Midi — <em>Dysnomia</em></h3>
<p>I feel bad for Roly Porter down there in 20th, my reasoning having been that I hadn’t found the time to listen to his LP in its entirety on enough occasions. I found that time for <em>Dysnomia</em>, partly because I came to the record earlier in the year, but also because it absolutely floored me on first listen. I was introduced to this band and this album by an episode of the Radiolab podcast and the ideas clicked with me: musical improvisation as a competitive artform; Aphex Twin and trance as rhythmic progenitors; the incremental development of a new style that brings the cold precision of computer-generated electronica through the warming filter of human players and acoustic instruments. The closest touchstone in my listening experience is probably The Necks, but this album feels tighter and more sparse in a way I find completely captivating. Dawn of Midi do an awful lot with comparatively little here, and I just can’t get enough of it.</p>
<h3 id="9-atoms-for-peace--amok">9. Atoms for Peace — <em>AMOK</em></h3>
<p>I don’t need to waste words here explaining how central Thom Yorke has been to my musical life since the mid-90s. What does need to be said, for fear of it being taken for granted, is how ceaselessly inquisitive he is as a musician. This latest dispatch seems to be an offshoot of the <em>Eraser</em> / <em>King of Limbs</em> branch (no pun intended) but has more than enough to it to also feel new and vital. Nothing feels like a retread, perhaps because Yorke is smart enough to surround himself with world-class musicians and do exactly what they collectively intend without compromise. I do feel that it’s easy to accept brilliance as a given from Yorke, and that threatens to obscure the achievement - I’ve loved listening to this album all year and I remain super-excited to learn what comes next.</p>
<h3 id="8-tegan--sara--heartthrob">8. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Heartthrob</em></h3>
<p>I was disappointed in this record at first. 2004’s <em>So Jealous</em> remains my favourite T&amp;S album, and it’s taken some effort of will to contend with the reality that with each subsequent release they’re moving in a different direction. <em>Sainthood</em> (2009) took me some time to adjust to, and the jump to <em>Heartthrob</em> (perhaps evidenced in the four-year wait) felt even greater to me. The Quins sound like almost entirely different musicians from three albums ago, and that’s something to celebrate and marvel at. It’s not quite a Madonna-style wholesale reinvention but something more organic, the thread of which can now be traced back through <em>Sainthood</em> and <em>The Con</em> (2007). Of course, until the next album <em>Heartthrob</em> feels like the destination rather than another point on a continuum, but through repeated listening I gradually fell for the evolution represented on this record. I can’t resist chanting along with ‘Shock to Your System’, and the opening couplets of ‘I Was a Fool’ are capable of bringing a tear to my eye.</p>
<h3 id="7-emptyset--recur">7. Emptyset — <em>Recur</em></h3>
<p>Not wishing to place too much importance on categories, electronic music of various stripes was huge for me in 2013, and <em>Recur</em> quickly materialised as the zenith of that when it was released in October. There’s a great balance on this album of slowly building - via loops, modular tones, white-noise patterns etc. - and surprising the listener with some new element. The titular recursion is both rhythmic and thematic, and provides the album’s spine. On to that are grafted some of the most sonically interesting and exciting pieces of techno / noise / sound collage I found this year. As I’ve begun to explore some of the topography of electronica it has, naturally, been a process of learning where my tastes lie. Of all the records from that world that I heard this year <em>Recur</em> cascaded more dopamine into my system than any other.</p>
<h3 id="6-haim--days-are-gone">6. HAIM — <em>Days Are Gone</em></h3>
<p>The debut album from these three Californian sisters (+ non-sibling drummer) is ridiculously catchy and possessed of a self-assurance in exactly what it is, which makes it pretty much irresistible. Part Fleetwood Mac, part 80s pop, part neon-lit dance, and soulful at the same time there’s is a lot to love here - especially since the mix doesn’t feel forced and doesn’t take any effort to listen to or learn, hum or sing along to. Songs such as album highlight ‘If I Could Change Your Mind’, Springsteen-esque ‘Don’t Save Me’, and the title track reveal a mature sense for songwriting and an emotional range that marks HAIM out from many of the poppier records I heard this year.</p>
<h3 id="5-kanye-west--yeezus">5. Kanye West — <em>Yeezus</em></h3>
<p>It still bugs me that I didn’t pick up Kanye’s previous album (<em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> (2010)) in the year of release; it would easily have been up there on the list. I had liked but not loved the first couple of albums, and been left cold by 2008’s <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>, but when I finally got around to listening to <em>MBDTF</em> it felt like the fulfilment of a promise. There’s little dispute about the fact that West is at the height of his powers right now, and <em>Yeezus</em> is unequivocally the product of an artist feeling completely unrestrained to create. The production alone here is flat-out stunning from first to last, sounding like nothing else I’ve heard. There are missteps (I’m not convinced Nina Simone’s ‘Strange Fruit’ is properly repurposed on ‘Blood on the Leaves’), and the album sags a bit in the middle, but nothing hit harder in 2013 than the first four tracks of this record. In terms of personality Kanye is hard to like, and some of the content is unsavoury, but it’s impossible to deny the artistry on display.</p>
<h3 id="4-chvrches--the-bones-of-what-you-believe">4. Chvrches — <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em></h3>
<p>To my mind this record is the pinnacle of what pop music produced this year. It fills the same role for me as Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em> did in 2010 and Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> last year: a meticulously crafted, brightly coloured blast of exuberant synth and singalong choruses. It’s not quite as flawless as the latter of those, but it is nevertheless an outstanding 50 minutes of polished, indelible songs, pretty much all of which are guaranteed to stick firmly in my head for hours and hours after listening. Not life changing perhaps, but thoroughly life-affirming.</p>
<h3 id="3-biffy-clyro--opposites">3. Biffy Clyro — <em>Opposites</em></h3>
<p>I was skeptical that Biffy Clyro would be able to follow 2007’s <em>Puzzle</em> with anything that hit me as hard, and somehow they bottled lightning and produced a genuinely incredible next step in <em>Only Revolutions</em> (2009). How do you follow those two? Apparently you make a record as big as both of them combined, reaching further in both directions - esoterica and radio anthem - than before, and leave pretty much everyone else looking like they’re not trying.</p>
<p>It took a long time for me to digest <em>Opposites</em>. I was so excited to hear it that as soon as it was released I had it on repeat and found myself dismayed that I wasn&rsquo;t keying into many of the tracks. I find that most Biffy songs lure you in with a seeming familiarity (of structure, of chord progression, of percussion) but are just off-kilter enough to ask the listener to do some of the work and meet them part-way. Listening to the entire album in whole gulps wasn’t doing it, and I had to break it up into two pieces and almost treat it as two separate albums. Then the rewards started flowing thick and fast: one giant-sized, super-powered anthem after another made its home in my head.</p>
<p>This album has been a near-constant presence throughout the year, and has survived since January to claim a place in the top 5 without any real doubt.</p>
<h3 id="2-manic-street-preachers--rewind-the-film">2. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Rewind the Film</em></h3>
<p>This year I saw Soundgarden play Brixton Academy. The material from their early-to- mid-90s heyday sounded great and the newer stuff sounded like they still want to be that same band (and aren’t quite capable of it). Here, on the other hand, is the 11th studio album from a band that have been together for more than two decades, and it’s a record that feels entirely at home in its skin. This year’s Pearl Jam album displays a similar understanding of how the musicians and the band’s place within the musical landscape has evolved, but the returns are lesser. What the Manics have achieved with <em>Rewind the Film</em> is very impressive indeed: a thoughtful, mature album that foregrounds the intelligence that their music has always possessed and doesn’t balk from examining the deeply unsexy subjects of middle age, depression, and Conservative Britain. As a document of a band’s continued mastery of their form it’s exceptional.</p>
<p>Some of that same confidence is also present in the decisions to stick almost entirely to acoustic instrumentation, and to let guest vocalists lead some of the album’s best songs. The interplay between Bradfield and Lucy Rose on opener ‘This Sullen Welsh Heart’ is inspired, and Richard Hawley’s performance on the title track is simply incredible.</p>
<p>This album was conceived as the first half of a two-album set, alongside the forthcoming <em>Futurology</em> (described as the next step on the path of <em>The Holy Bible</em> (1994) and <em>Journal for Plague Lovers</em> (2009)). I couldn’t be more excited to find out what the other half of the Manics’ sound has evolved into.</p>
<h3 id="1-arcade-fire--reflektor">1. Arcade Fire — <em>Reflektor</em></h3>
<p>There are many elements to my relationship with this record that echo my comments on Biffy Clyro’s: a double album the arrival of which had me wondering how it could possibly follow what came before, it also initially proved too large for me to parse as a single artefact. As with <em>Opposites</em>, breaking it in two bore fruit and it didn’t take long for me to fall for each piece of music, one-by-one. The genuine revelation, however, came when I was then able to recombine the constituent pieces into a whole, and follow the album’s many threads as they appear, disappear, reappear, and reflect over songs that feel at once entirely at home in the Arcade Fire catalogue and yet in many respects very new.</p>
<p>Each AF album feels so stylistically of-a-piece to me: <em>Funeral</em> is modest and even-tempered; <em>Neon Bible</em> showier and more sharply critical; <em>The Suburbs</em> a balanced maturation and expansion of <em>Funeral&rsquo;s</em> themes of home &amp; family etc. It seem to me that <em>Reflektor</em> is closer to <em>Neon Bible</em>: like that album it’s in some manner a conceptual statement, here repeatedly returning to the subject of modern relationships. The explorations it makes on its themes are nuanced, insightful, and never stray into heavy-handed cliché - there are few bands reporting the modern experience to us with this degree of authenticity and artistry. Arcade Fire are operating on a new level with <em>Reflektor</em>, and are quite possibly the only ones inhabiting it.</p>
<p>This is Arcade Fire’s fourth appearance at the top of my yearly list, and it was earned on merit. Already my favourite contemporary musical artists, I remain awed by what they are capable of.</p>

			 <p>For as long as I can recall I’ve had a propensity for starting more books than I finish, and for having more books in progress than I could sensibly manage at once. With other long-form media I tend to be fairly faithful to one offering at a time: I rarely have more than one narrative video game in progress, and whilst Elizabeth and I are adherents of the box-set as a manner of watching television we tend to stick to one show at a time. With books, however, I tend to wander.</p>
<p>Perhaps it comes from having spent five years as a literature student. In that time I was bound to a relatively strict reading regimen, within which texts were selected for me and had to be finished by a certain date. Fruitful seminar discussion, the delivering of presentations, and the writing of essay papers all depended on the timely completion of reading assignments, and whilst reading around the subject was encouraged, there was nevertheless a very definite structure of what to read and when to read it.</p>
<p>Conversely, there was another element to literary study that wasn’t all rigorous working to a reading list. Particularly within my postgraduate study the research and composition of longer critical pieces called for the development of a certain set of skills: the ability to parse information from multiple, diverse sources and draw parallels and comparisons between them whilst building a coherent argument of one’s own. I loved this part - the collecting of tangentially related texts, coming to a greater understanding of how the art and the arguments hung together. Paintings mentioned in poems that were referred to in journal articles about novels. I can see some of that reflected in my natural inclination to start one book and then reach for another. Before leaving for New York recently I decided to (re-)read some novels set in the city. I managed Teju Cole’s <em>Open City</em>, about half of Adelle Waldman’s <em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.</em>, 30 pages of Paul Auster’s <em>New York Trilogy</em>, and part of DeLillo’s <em>Falling Man</em>… the rest of the time was spent reading sections of Leo Hollis’s <em>Cities are Good For You</em>, and dipping into Ann Beattie’s <em>New Yorker Stories</em>. One book sparked off an interest in another, and reading each opened a new window onto the ones that came before and after.</p>
<p>In-and-of-itself this kind of scattershot approach to text selection is not an inherently bad thing; the only real shame of it is that I manage to see so few books through to the end. I have lost track of the number of novels, non-fiction books, and collections of short stories I have started in the last year, but I would guess that the number I have completed is in single digits. Reading for pleasure - or perhaps I should say ‘casual reading’, since reading for class was often also pleasurable - can (and perhaps should) be approached with a different mindset to reading for study. With no goal other than the completion of the text perhaps there is an argument to be made for giving oneself over to the book at hand and expending less energy on trying to understand its place within the larger literary universe. I’ve decided to put this idea to the test by resolving to read just one book at a time for a while. I think it might be interesting to see how my reading habits change, and whether I get something different from the texts when they’re read in isolation.</p>
<p>To test my newfound resolve the first novel I’ve decided upon is Haruki Murakami’s three-volume, 928-page opus <em>1Q84</em>. It may seem counterintuitive to make the first hurdle a particularly high one, but looked at a different way <em>1Q84</em> is a proposition so solid and implacable that it provides the perfect object to which to anchor myself. To make it through a 200 page novel without deviating into infidelity might be a fluke; if I can get straight through to the end of <em>1Q84</em> it’ll be something of an accomplishment.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing I am making good progress (volume 2, page 617 to be exact), and I have every hope that I’m going to make it to the end uninterrupted. I <em>have</em>, I should admit, already begun to daydream about what to start next. Before this new regime came into play I purchased a copy of JJ Abrams &amp; Dave Dorst’s <em>S.</em> (2013) whilst waiting for a flight at JFK, and read the first 40 or so pages. That book is calling me back, though I have my reservations: at 472 pages it’s another fairly substantial commitment, plus the various convoluted machinations of the narrative and structure mean it requires close reading. Also, since the book is in some ways a celebration of the printed word it really needs to be read in paper form to be properly appreciated, and that would cut out nighttime iPad reading which is when I tend to make substantial progress. All of which is the kind of problem I don’t mind having!</p>
<p>Right now, once I’m done with the Murakami, I like the idea of powering through something thin in a day or two and really trying to hit my stride. I’d like to finish more books in 2014, which in my case is a very different thing to ‘reading more’ - it just means more consistently finishing what I start.</p>

			 <p>Having variously stared at the floor and attempted to disappear behind his own hand during the event organisers' laudatory introductions of him, <a href="https://www.ryoichikurokawa.com/">Ryoichi Kurokawa</a> takes the stage quickly and silently. BFI Southbank&rsquo;s NFT1 is sold to capacity<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and in near complete darkness, the brightest light source in the room being the glowing apple on the lid of one of Kurokawa&rsquo;s MacBooks. This is the debut UK performance of <em>syn_</em> (2011), a powerful and complex sensory experience which is at times designedly overwhelming. The piece is an evolution of <em>cm: av_c</em> (2005), a version of which was presented at Tate Modern in 2007, and the performance is Kurokawa&rsquo;s first in the UK since appearing at The Roundhouse in 2010.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/5aaae9cccb.png" alt="">

<p>Just about discernible, silhouetted against a pair of giant projected screens, Kurokawa works concentratedly and fluidly at a pair of laptops, mixing and affecting image and sound which comes now in a stream, now in a barrage, and then in fits &amp; starts. Skittering, incomplete breakbeats loop in and out of beds of white and pink noise; bass or synth throbs, crescendos, dies; the seeming randomness of this least-hummable of music actively combats the tendency of ear and mind to relax into the familiarity of pattern recognition.</p>
<p>It goes similarly with the visuals: they flare up, flash, morph one to another to another, spawn unanticipated lines of connection. Whilst the event notes entreat the viewer / listener not to &lsquo;digest gradually with the head&rsquo; but rather to &lsquo;feel simultaneously with the eyes and ears&rsquo; I found myself able to experience the work at this pre-cognitive level only for very short periods. The mind&rsquo;s tendency toward processing and categorisation is too strong and too deeply ingrained to consistently suppress, and even making the effort to do so with respect to higher cognition I found myself incapable of not perceiving the visual elements of the piece as belonging to particular sets: organic, geometric, topographical…</p>
<p>As brilliantly matched as the aural &amp; visual elements of <em>syn_</em> are, the differences between the acts of listening and looking become starkly apparent. I was aware of sonic elements shifting between the left and right speakers, but never felt that I was hearing only <em>part</em> of the composition. Conversely, the separation of the visuals over two screens (combined with my relative closeness to the stage) meant that it was only possible to take in the visuals from one or other at any one time. The volume and frequencies of the music are judged to be loud but not challenging, whereas the visuals are occasionally tuned to be difficult to watch: too bright and too sudden, bracketed by periods of darkness.</p>
<p>As both a live music and a visual arts experience the 45 minute performance was quite unlike anything I&rsquo;ve witnessed before: enthralling and powerful, it makes a compelling case for the digital arts as live event.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>On 20th November 2003 I took a long walk. Over the preceding few weeks I had fallen for a girl, and it took a couple of hours walking the streets surrounding the university campus to find the courage to tell her. At sunset exactly ten years later, I was stood with her at the top of the Empire State Building.</p>
<p>Our recent trip to New York was a dream come true for me. I had been to the US a couple of times as a child — Florida on one occasion, and California on another — and had long wanted to return as an adult. To be making the journey with the woman I love, and celebrating a decade spent together, was a special addition.</p>
<p>In the months of anticipation running up to the trip we had amassed guidebooks, put in hours of research online, made lists, and stuck more pins in virtual maps than we could ever have hoped to cover in a month, let alone a week. We wanted to strike a balance between tourist stuff — not knowing if we&rsquo;d ever be back in NY — and other activities that would give us a sense of the city as a lived-in place rather than a visited one. I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by cities: the organisation of them; the way they work; the benefits and compromises of living within them — and New York, in many respects, felt like the <em>non plus ultra</em> of the metropolitan concept.</p>
<p>There was a point in the planning when we&rsquo;d considered getting a hotel in Brooklyn, but eventually decided on lower Manhattan — <a href="http://www.nolitanhotel.com">The Nolitan</a> on Kenmare St — which I think proved to be the right choice. Over the week we spent the majority of our time in various parts of Manhattan, and a day in Brooklyn. In the end I was really happy with how much we managed to fit in: both the bigger things like The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building, Central Park etc. and those smaller items on my mental tick-list such as getting a pretzel, seeing a smoking manhole cover, and reading <em>The New York Times</em> over breakfast. We saw a basketball game, went to a movie just off of Times Square, and drank tea in Bryant Park whilst we watched people skate&hellip;. The days were so full and I spent the evenings furiously scribbling down the details in a notebook so I wouldn&rsquo;t forget anything; if you&rsquo;re planning a trip and want restaurant tips just ask!</p>
<p>I brought back so many memories from NY, along with the sense of having been incredibly lucky to get to do it all. We may have visited a week before Thanksgiving, but no one could have been more thankful than I was on 20th November 2013 — just beneath the sky, looking down on the glowing grid of streetlights and taillights, my head on Elizabeth&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

			 <p>This year&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en movie of choice was <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> (2012), the story of a British sound engineer working on an Italian horror movie, which had been on my radar as one of the first films to receive a glowing review from <a href="http://thedissolve.com/reviews/25-berberian-sound-studio/">The Dissolve</a>.</p>
<p>The film, a British production from director Peter Strickland, is an oddly tense mood piece centred around a brilliantly restrained performance by career character actor Toby Jones. Over the years Jones has had a couple of prominent roles - most notably perhaps as the lead in 2006&rsquo;s <em>other</em> Truman Capote biopic - and recently he appeared as a fantastically loathsome Percy Alleline in Tomas Alfredson&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>. He was amongst a pretty stellar cast there, but here he&rsquo;s likely to be the most recognisable face. His range in the role of Gilderoy is just wide enough to introduce questions about the character&rsquo;s psychological state as events proceed, without making the film something it&rsquo;s not supposed to be.</p>
<p>That same thin line is walked expertly in the direction. It would have been very easy to allow the elements of this film to creep into pastiche, but Strickland has found a balance reminiscent of David Lynch in which the material is self-aware but still retains an unsettling aspect. As the various story threads progress the plot begins to blur some of the lines between what Gilderoy is working on and what he&rsquo;s living through. This bleeding of realities is mirrored in the construction of the film itself. Visual elements are often quickly intercut or presented as layered onscreen: characters seen behind glass which also reflects something else; light leaks encroaching onto the faces of (mock-)terrified voice actors.</p>
<p>In one particularly memorable moment the very fabric of the film seems to corrupt, celluloid skipping off the reel and melting. Strickland uses a lot of these tricks to speak to Gilderoy&rsquo;s deteriorating state, and one of the film&rsquo;s great charms is that so little of the turmoil actually plays out in Gilderoy himself. Jones&rsquo;s portrayal is too thoroughly British to resort to overt displays of emotion: he&rsquo;s the anti-Jack Torrance, battling homesickness by listening to recordings of a mantlepiece clock and quietly reading (increasingly disturbing) letters from his mother. The one occasion on which he does try to channel the passionate Italian way of doing things is presented as a laughable failure. The dichotomy of a staid central performance amid increasing visual and narrative discord is tremendously effective.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly for a film set predominantly in a sound studio however, the greatest achievement here is in sound design. More so than any film I can think of <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> intends the audience to be aware of its auditory elements as vital components in storytelling. Early on we are introduced to the concepts of overdubbing and foley, and presented with a character in Gilderoy whose reputation is as a master of sound mixing. The film&rsquo;s genius is in the fact that no matter how frequently it draws attention to soundtrack as an artificial construction of filmmaking you never stop falling for the trick. Strickland employs many techniques to foreground the production of film audio: frequent close-ups on dials, sliders, and tape machines; full-screen shots of oscilloscopes; characters surrounded by magnetic tape that moves and shimmers as it records. And yet, as soon as the film provides you with something else to concentrate on you cease to consider the effects of the soundtrack on your viewing experience. The delight Strickland takes in whipping that particular rug out from under the audience is palpable, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed as I realised for the dozenth time that I&rsquo;d been fooled by the same sleight-of-ear. The co-conspirator in the mix is a knowing soundtrack by Birmingham electronic outfit Broadcast, making this one of the most sonically interesting films I&rsquo;ve ever come across.</p>
<p><em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> is wonderfully unique. Lynch may be the closest touchstone, but this is a more muted offering that remains just this side of psychological freefall. It also knows when to end, the lack of a neat resolution implying that what we have seen thus far is the start of something perhaps unresolvable - a loop of tape skipping reels, and playing over.</p>

			 <p><em>Böikzmöind</em> is a half-hour doc on Bristol&rsquo;s fixed-gear cycling scene, and more broadly on fixie culture in general. It&rsquo;s well shot, slickly edited, and smart about what it makes time for: as you might expect from a movie made by enthusiasts it&rsquo;s brimming with all kinds of positivity. Each successive interviewee and rider has a new angle on why they love riding fixed, and their passion is infectious. Bristol, which features just as prominently as any one rider, also comes through looking like a challenging but pretty idyllic space to cycle.<br>

</div></p>
<p>The whole feel of the doc is impressively thought through: it has a great selection of music via Bristol&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.invada.co.uk">Invada Records</a>, and the red &amp; white colour scheme, and bold typography give the whole thing a simple, clean, cohesive identity. The credit sequences in particular show a really strong aesthetic, and the website carries all this over neatly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see a well made document of a scene like this, which feels born very naturally out of a desire to showcase the people and their passion. Those extraneous umlauts are a clue to the film&rsquo;s tone, which takes its subjects about as seriously as they take themselves. Ultimately that&rsquo;s what makes the whole thing so entertaining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d definitely also recommend checking out the 4-minute short <em>Fixed &amp; Chips</em> over on Böikzmöind&rsquo;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/55007585">Vimeo page</a>.</p>

			 <p>“Going&hellip;” Celine says. And a moment later: “Going&hellip;.”</p>
<p>She and Jesse sit watching the orange Sun fall into the hills of the southern Greek Peloponnese.</p>
<p>“Going&hellip;” she says, and then: “Gone.”</p>
<p>In many ways, where <em>Before Sunrise</em> (1995) was concerned with beginnings and with possibilities, and where <em>Before Sunset</em> (2004) was interested in interruption and continuation, this third film in Linklater, Delpy, &amp; Hawke’s series deals with endings. So much of the film’s wonderful dialogue - which again flows naturally and musically back and forth both in communal conversations and the prolonged two-party scenes that are the films' hallmark - is given over to topics around absence, lessening, and loss. That isn’t to say that <em>Before Midnight</em> (2013) is a tonally bleak piece of cinema: a rich vein of humour runs throughout it, and the characters’ warmth of personality, their likability and the vitality of their relationships one to another is too engaging and heartening a spectacle for this to be a downbeat film.</p>
<p>There is some darkness here, including a real-seeming threat to a relationship that we as an audience have built a genuine attachment to. The three main creative parties - and all say that this is now an enterprise born equally of three minds - do not shy from examining the flaws in the characters’ relationship. The evolution from starry-eyed naifs engaged in the idyllic night-long walk that forms the basis of one of modern cinema’s most memorable romantic films, to the stressed working parents of twin girls is deftly and believably handled. We still find ourselves as invested in Celine and Jesse’s lives, still interested in what they think and say, and how they feel about each other. To base one film primarily around a conversation between two people is impressive; to sustain the same conversation over three films and 18 years is a remarkable artistic achievement. As with Updike’s series of Rabbit novels there is something powerfully compelling about seeing characters we know age alongside us. We now have a triptych of portraits of these two: brilliantly drawn and evolving. May we meet again.</p>

			 <p>About this time last year Google closed down its five year-old Google Notebook service. I had been using Notebook for some time and had quite a bit of content in there; I had found it to be a pretty powerful, streamlined tool for note-taking and organisation. Google presumably chose to &lsquo;sunset&rsquo; the service because its self-contained nature left little room for it to interact with other of their products in a manner which could generate revenue.</p>
<p>Today is the final day of another Google service: the RSS feed reader built as part of the Google Labs process, and introduced in 2005. Google Reader was my introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">RSS</a>, a technology that has become a daily part of my online activity ever since. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/20/4446590/digg-raids-googles-trash-for-new-rss-reader">Reports vary</a> on the level of resources required to sustain a feed reading service, though the greater burden is likely to be in terms of memory and computation power (both of which Google has an almost infinite supply of) rather than person hours. It&rsquo;s also arguable that feed collecting and reading fits more closely with Google&rsquo;s central search service, and offers a clearer opportunity for the company&rsquo;s advertising business. In this respect one of the contributing factors for Google&rsquo;s shutting down of Reader is likely to be to shift emphasis onto companies' and pages' presence on the Google+ service; just a couple of days ago <a href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/new-google-plugins-for-your-website.html">improvements were revealed</a> to the social network&rsquo;s JavaScript follow buttons and plugins.</p>
<p>In the wake of Google Reader a number of services have emerged hoping to attract the attention of those who had relied upon it: <a href="http://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://www.feedbin.me">Feedbin</a>, and Betaworks' newly-launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_Reader">Digg Reader</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> all look promising, with the first two of those also being supported by Silvio Rizzi&rsquo;s best-in-field iOS &amp; OS X app <a href="http://www.reederapp.com">Reeder</a>. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how the RSS ecosystem adapts to the closure of Google Reader, which had become the default standard having killed off smaller services when it launched. I&rsquo;ll be paying particular attention to how <a href="http://www.betaworks.com">Betaworks</a> draw the balance between their disparate products: a content aggregator (<a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>), a link shortener (<a href="http://bit.ly">Bit.ly</a>), the recently purchased read-it-later service <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, and now an RSS reader.</p>
<p>In real terms I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll feel the closure of Google Reader all that significantly; it was technology I accessed almost exclusively through third-party apps (surely another contributing factor in its closure) and that is something that will remain a viable option long after 1 July with the new services stepping in.</p>

			 <p>My memory of Tate Modern&rsquo;s Rothko exhibition in 2011 is of sitting, stunned, in front of these huge, imposing canvases that to me up until that point had only been images in books or on screens. It was the kind of visceral encounter with visual art that happens all too rarely - a qualitatively different experience to the usual ocular / intellectual engagement that comes from wandering a gallery.</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/10df999bce.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/3810bb4821.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/045ad7381e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Something similar happened when I recently paid my first visit to <a href="https://www.whitecube.com">White Cube</a>, a gallery on Bermondsey Street in South East London. I had read about an exhibition, titled <em>Liminal Squared</em>, by Ethiopia-born artist Julie Mehretu that represented her reaction to the recent &amp; ongoing protests, demonstrations, and revolutions throughout north Africa and western Asia.</p>
<p>Totalling twelve pieces over three separate galleries I was repeatedly surprised by the scale Mehretu worked in. The first piece you encounter as you enter South Gallery I is <em>Kabul</em> (2013). It&rsquo;s a large room, featureless as the venue&rsquo;s name suggests, and the 243.8 x 365.8 cm canvas, along with the even larger <em>Invisible Sun (algorithm 2)</em> (2013) on the adjoining wall dominate the white surfaces. I sat on the gallery floor to read the artist&rsquo;s bio, and looking up at these pieces made them feel all the more imposing. The longer you look at them new elements surface: exacting, digitally-drawn, blueprint-style lines; pencil elements drawn with a ruler (less exacting but still so); smudges of carbon or paint; bold lines of acrylic colour; loops &amp; strikes of black in varying degrees of boldness. Up close elements appear layered, some visible as though seen through tracing paper.</p>
<p>On the train that morning I had started reading Adam Thirlwell&rsquo;s novella <em>Kapow!</em> (2012), which is also a kind of response to the same geo-political events. Mehretu&rsquo;s work brought to mind a passage in which the narrator begins to think about complexity &amp; connectedness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;in my suspended state I was developing a theory that the important thing was to make connections between as many disparate objects as possible, like Godard saying somewhere that an image shouldn&rsquo;t be a comparison so much as a meeting of two more or less separated realities. The more the relations between the two realities are distant and just, said JLG, the more the image will be a strong one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>— Thirlwell, Adam. <em>Kapow!</em>. London: Visual Editions, 2012. 10-11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second gallery - 9x9x9 - has a set of five smaller etchings and another huge piece: <em>Aether (Venice)</em> (2011) (456.5 x 345.5 cm).</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/c7ce71c7b3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pre-dating <em>Kabul</em> by two years <em>Aether (Venice)</em> shares much of its techniques as well as its scale. The decision to display it after the more recent work is likely down to keeping the five 2013 pieces together in the first gallery. Similarly, the works collected in the third and final space - South Gallery II - belong together as they comprise a series: <em>Mogamma: A Painting in Four Parts</em> (2013). The way these pieces are displayed at White Cube is stunning: the four 457.2 x 365.8 cm canvases angled into a central seating area, the white walls on which they are hung enveloped by deep pockets of shadow that delineate this quartet whilst also creating a unique, private-feeling space in which to experience it.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/aa416bdb36.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Liminal Squared</em> is at White Cube, Bermondsey until 7 July, 2013. New York&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com">Marian Goodman Gallery</a> also showed new work by Mehretu, concurrent with the White Cube exhibition. A joint catalogue is due to be published in July.</p>

			 <p>What is it about documentary as a medium that excites and interests us? Is it the chance to learn something about corners of the world, and the lives lived in them, which we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t get to? Is it the chance to be inspired by another&rsquo;s accomplishment? Perhaps we hope to learn something about ourselves by learning about others.<br>

<p>David Gelb&rsquo;s feature-length profile of master sushi chef (or &lsquo;shokunin&rsquo;) Jiro Ono has all of these strengths: at once a fascinating portrait of an artisan and a vivid glimpse of life amid Tokyo fish markets and restaurant culture.</p>
<p>Jiro, still running a restaurant at the age of 85, is the film&rsquo;s mercurial centre. Softly spoken and delicately mannered he is a constant, still presence for most of his screen time. He speaks of himself with modesty and deprecation, and remains silent or displays good humour when others speak about him. A picture of Jiro&rsquo;s values comes together fairly quickly: dedication, pride, the struggle towards perfection. He remembers the seating order of guests so that he can serve slightly smaller portions to the women, ensuring that everyone finishes their courses at the same time. During the first course he notices guests' handedness and adjusts the placement of food on their plate for the next course as necessary.</p>
<p>What makes the film so compelling is watching how these traits have shaped Jiro&rsquo;s life and the lives of those around him. His sons, both shokunin in their own right, display genuine admiration for their father but are also mindful of the weight of his reputation. Through this lens Gelb teases out some interesting facets of Japanese family life; he does a wonderful job of making the film&rsquo;s handful of locations a staging ground for a lot of personal exposition: the sushi master, his sons, and his apprentices all revealed amid the web of familial, professional, and societal forces that bind them. At the periphery there is also the tuna merchant and the rice dealer, kindred spirits to Jiro similarly immersed in the minutiae of their respective trades. We are also afforded a glimpse into Jiro&rsquo;s past - a difficult childhood; a bad reputation at school - which entreats us to wonder how it informed the man that he became.</p>
<p>Gelb&rsquo;s film is impressively balanced. It is not an easy task to bring the viewer into an unfamiliar culture, to introduce them to its nuances and the characters within it, and at the same time to construct a detailed, intimate picture of one man. Expert editing keeps this world in motion whilst displaying a flawless instinct for when the viewer will benefit from savouring details. David Gelb also served as the film&rsquo;s cinematographer, and his delight in the aesthetics of what Jiro and his team are creating is unmistakeable. Slow-motion photography of fine ingredients and graceful culinary processes vary the film&rsquo;s pace and allow us to immerse ourselves in the day-to-day activity of Jiro&rsquo;s world: ruby slabs of tuna, sheets of nori hand toasted over an open flame, the correct amount of time to massage an octopus to ensure that it is tender and flavourful.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to understand more about the tradition of sushi restaurants, or you&rsquo;re seeking to be inspired by the story of an exceptional individual <em>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</em> has a lot to offer. Every aspect of the film is superbly crafted and the manner in which it handles the various layers of its subject is ceaselessly compelling. As well as new understanding you will likely come away with new questions, and perhaps that is the documentary medium&rsquo;s greatest strength of all.</p>

			 <p>Whilst wandering around the internet recently, I came across this comic by <a href="http://www.incidentalcomics.com/">Grant Snider</a>. I liked it instantly, clipped it, and then found myself going back to it frequently enough that it became obvious I had to write something about it.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/4781f02f60.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in minimalism, in its various forms, for quite a while: I find my interests leaning that way when it comes to design and architectural aesthetics; I wrote <a href="/uploads/2023/bf9357dbc8.pdf">my Masters thesis</a> on the history of literary minimalism. Personally — and this was something that Snider&rsquo;s comic really brought home — my interest in minimalism is caught up with my interest in Buddhism. As I found myself thinking about the elements Snider had set out, I kept seeing parallels with Buddhist thought, and with my own practice.</p>
<h2 id="get-rid-of-the-unnecessary">Get Rid of the Unnecessary</h2>
<p>This is the core of it really, and it can be as prosaic or as profound as you like. Realising the difference between what is necessary and what is unnecessary is surpassingly difficult, and can easily equate to a lifetime&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s fascinating, as you get older, to discover how your attitudes to different elements of your life change — how things that once seemed so vital lose their pull, and that which you once wouldn&rsquo;t have given a second thought, takes on new importance. What is &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; is a shifting thing, and it <em>should be</em>. The valuable skill is tuning into what you honestly find to be important in the moment, and understanding your reasons. In that respect, minimalism emphasises focus.</p>
<h2 id="create-structure">Create Structure</h2>
<p>Minimalism is also concerned with balance. As well as removing the extraneous, it&rsquo;s important to be mindful of how that which remains is arranged. Understanding the relationships between a structure&rsquo;s components is a central ideal of minimalism, whether it&rsquo;s the clean through-line of a short story, or the thoughtful arrangement of a room&rsquo;s furniture.</p>
<p>Structure can also be constraining if employed too heavy-handedly, and I think there&rsquo;s a real difference between being aware of structure, and trying to impose it too strictly; if an <em>organic</em> structure works best, there&rsquo;s room for that too.</p>
<h2 id="stop-searching-for-hidden-meaning">Stop Searching for Hidden Meaning</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to misread this one as a call for the acceptance of surfaces, and the surrender of one&rsquo;s exploratory impulse. I prefer to think of it in terms of spending less energy wondering about — or worrying about — the invisible, the possible, the elusive. For me it goes hand-in-hand with the next point…</p>
<h2 id="embrace-what-is-solid">Embrace What is Solid</h2>
<p>Which is to say: be mindful of the present moment. One of the Buddhist principles I find most helpful, and yet most difficult to practice in daily life, is exactly this engagement with the moment itself. We&rsquo;re so used to looking forward and backward, and to thinking of things (and ourselves) in terms of our history and future. The minimalist call to stop looking for hidden meaning, and to embrace what&rsquo;s solid, is very similar to the Buddhist ideal of expending less energy on magical thinking, and more on the only real thing there is: the present moment.</p>
<h2 id="lose-yourself-in-patterns">Lose Yourself in Patterns</h2>
<p>There is a reason my first blog (more or less a decade ago!) was titled andthenpatterns. Yes, most directly it was named after the Four Tet track, but it&rsquo;s also down to how compelling I&rsquo;ve always found even the idea of patterns. Pretty much the only thing I took away from AS-Level maths was a glimpse at how numbers could produce some beautiful things. The application of that discipline was beyond me, but I took on a love of geometry that stays with me. This also speaks to the above points about structure and necessity; there can be nothing extraneous in a tessellation.</p>
<p>Patterns also cropped up when I studied psychology, in relation to models of human cognition and memory. I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the extent to which patterns over which we have no control, dictate our experiences. In that regard, I like even more the specific manner in which this point is phrased: &lsquo;lose <em>yourself</em> in patterns&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="dont-fear-empty-space">Don&rsquo;t Fear Empty Space</h2>
<p>In terms of minimalist aesthetics, this can be read as a reminder that absence can be active. Whether it&rsquo;s the architecture of a physical space, the design of a webpage or printed document, or the form of a statue, this is a reminder that space can be just as important as content. Minimalism pushes back against the impulses to complicate and to fill every gap. I read this in conjunction with the first item: remove what isn&rsquo;t needed, and make the space which is created an integral part of the whole.</p>
<p>This point also brings us right back to Buddhism again, where the concept of emptiness is key. To the extent that Buddhist practice is goal-oriented (and that&rsquo;s a whole other can of worms), one of the things it is working towards is the realisation that everything is empty. That sounds super-depressing until you begin to realise its implications. In part, that begins with the above points about the relationship between the solid, the moment, and literally everything else. Buddhists are big on causality — or dependent origination if you want to be fancy, — and the endgame is the realisation that emptiness and continuum are inescapable truths, and solidity is an illusion. If you&rsquo;re thinking that conflicts with the invocation to &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo; that&rsquo;s probably smart; I think that&rsquo;s a facet of the problem that Buddhism is engaged with.</p>
<h2 id="stay-clean">Stay Clean</h2>
<p>This is just good advice in general, but in terms of minimalist aesthetics it is probably best thought of (as with the patterns and the empty space above) with respect to the arrangement of elements. Removing the unnecessary is dependant on an understanding of what <em>is</em> necessary, and part of that is understanding the elements' relationships, one to another. In the visual arts you often hear people say things about &lsquo;clean lines&rsquo;; what that has always boiled down to for me, is an artist with a clear idea of how their work functions. Clarity is perhaps, overall, a more useful concept than cleanliness, but minimalism&rsquo;s rejection of needless complexity often makes the two synonymous.</p>
<h2 id="be-bold-and-colourful">Be Bold and Colourful</h2>
<p>I like this one because it speaks out against the misconception of minimalism as overly subtle or reductionist. That might be true in some cases, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s inherent to minimalism as a style or as a concept. There&rsquo;s nothing subtle about work like Kasimir Malevich&rsquo;s <a href="https://artsy.net/artwork/kasimir-malevich-black-cross">&lsquo;Black Cross&rsquo;</a>, or Sol Lewitt&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-number-1093-bars-of-color">Wall Drawings</a> — these are undiluted artistic statements. Minimalism, in all its forms, can be enormously impactful by virtue of having cut away complicating factors. A minimalist work isn&rsquo;t engaged in too-clever obfuscation; it&rsquo;s asking to be engaged with by someone who is willing to &lsquo;stop looking for hidden meaning&rsquo; and &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s something inspiring in that plainness, as there is in the level of conviction that minimalism requires: it&rsquo;s a form without room for equivocation.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-too-expressive">Don&rsquo;t Be Too Expressive</h2>
<p>This is something that comes up a lot in reference to literary minimalism: the accusation (and the manner in which it&rsquo;s raised is almost always accusatory) that the language employed by writers like Raymond Carver, Amy Hempel <em>et al</em> is flat, disengaged, and emotionally barren.</p>
<p>What is it about minimalism that shies away from the direct conveyance of emotion? The mistake that is often made is to suggest that this property of minimalism is resultant of fear of emotionality. This line of thinking holds that minimalism is dehumanising, and that it rejects emotions as too messy and unpredictable. Such an argument, however, assumes the prominence of emotionality in every sphere of our lives, and proceeds under the understanding that this is an unassailable state of affairs. Isn&rsquo;t there something to be said then for the minimalist model&rsquo;s placing emotion aside? By removing the unnecessary and giving emptiness its due, minimalism often (though not always) seeks to give us some room, and one important aspect of this room is to encourage reflection. For example, examination of one&rsquo;s <em>response</em> to a work of art can be an important manner of engagement. Avoidance of emotionality can be a high barrier for entry when approaching minimalism in the visual arts — and it is certainly a criticism favoured by those who deride literary minimalism — but I think there is something to be said for art that doesn&rsquo;t prescribe an emotional reaction.</p>
<p>At the same time, much as I love minimalism, it would be myopic to suggest that it is universally appropriate. Minimalist artworks can be beautiful and meaningful, but there are places they cannot go. Similarly, minimalist music can be intricate and mesmerising, but you can&rsquo;t listen to Philip Glass all the time — you also need The White Stripes and Miles Davis, because, as messy as they are, they do things minimalism isn&rsquo;t interested in.</p>
<h2 id="less-is-more-but-less-is-more-difficult-than-it-looks">Less is More… But Less is More Difficult than it Looks</h2>
<p>Read: this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>. Second only to the idea that it is reductionist, the next most common misconception of minimalism is that it is easy. Going right back up to the top, minimalism requires an understanding of what is necessary and what is not. It also necessitates a true understanding of the remaining parts' interoperability. You can&rsquo;t fake that, and attempts to do so are easily found out. True minimalism in any form is a pretty rigorous discipline.</p>
<p>And, returning to a theme that has run throughout here, Buddhist practice can be the same. As the proverb goes: if you think doing nothing is easy, try it some time. Seriously, silent meditation is a great leveller, simply because it presents you with nothing but space for reflection — learning just to sit with yourself can be a really tough challenge, but that&rsquo;s the space from which everything else proceeds. Kind of like De Niro in his prime, you just have to learn to do nothing <em>really</em> well.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-the-xx--coexist">20. The xx — <em>Coexist</em></h3>
<p>Like a lot of people I discovered The xx in 2009 when it was already too late to
not be influenced in some respects by the hype surrounding their debut. In
following up the Mercury winning <em>xx</em> they have chosen to refine their sound
rather than make any radical alterations to it, but the result is a more focussed
album than their first. I feel about it similarly to how I feel about Portishead&rsquo;s
first two albums: the second is a more complete and technically perfect
distillation of the band&rsquo;s sound, though (in both cases) I marginally prefer the
debut.</p>
<h3 id="19-the-mars-volta--noctourniquet">19. The Mars Volta — <em>Noctourniquet</em></h3>
<p>The Mars Volta have been with us for almost a decade now and I feel no closer to
working them out. As maddeningly obtuse as anything they&rsquo;ve ever put out,
<em>Noctourniquet</em> continues in the vein of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Octahedron</em> but with added
dark-synth elements that do something to compliment Cedric&rsquo;s vocals, which still
walk the line between seeming stream-of-consciousness &amp; tightly controlled.
This is an album full of wilful music that only just falls short of their peak to date,
which remains <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em> (2008).</p>
<h3 id="18-the-shins--port-of-morrow">18. The Shins — <em>Port of Morrow</em></h3>
<p>It was with no small amount of impatience that I waited five years for a follow-up
to <em>Wincing the Night Away</em> - one of my favourite albums of 2007. If this new
effort from James Mercer et al is lower down this list than expected it&rsquo;s
perhaps owing to the fact that it takes so few risks. In projects like Broken Bells
and the track on <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em>, Mercer has shown that he&rsquo;s willing and
able to try different things, and yet <em>Port of Morrow</em> plays it so straight that it&rsquo;s
hard not to feel just a touch cheated. The flip side of that coin is that what is here
is quintessential Shins: &lsquo;Simple Song’ could be the band’s calling card. It&rsquo;s a
record I enjoy a lot, but which found itself – fairly or not – dwarfed by five years of expectation.</p>
<h3 id="17-fiona-apple--the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do">17. Fiona Apple — <em>The Idler Wheel is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do</em></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange to think that Laura Marling&rsquo;s entire three-album career to date fits
comfortably within the gap between Fiona Apple records. Apple is in no rush,
and the release of <em>Idler Wheel&hellip;</em> was rightly met with huge expectations. As it
turns out it’s a complex beast of a record, ceaselessly expressive and
impassioned but, like its title, sometimes unwieldy and rarely neat. I don&rsquo;t say
that pejoratively, I feel like it’s a choice taken consciously in the putting together
of the record, and one that often pays dividends. Apple&rsquo;s voice remains
incredible, with some of the extents she pushes it to (on ‘Daredevil’ for example)
being comparable to PJ Harvey&rsquo;s exploration of her limits on last year&rsquo;s <em>Let
England Shake</em>. Far from easily digestible, and as such a hugely rewarding
record. ‘Every Single Night’ remains the most stunning piece of music I heard all
year.</p>
<h3 id="16-deadmau5---album-title-goes-here-">16. Deadmau5 — <em>&gt; album title goes here &lt;</em></h3>
<p>A late-in-the-year discovery for me prompted by looking into the track ‘Professional Griefers&rsquo; featuring Gerard Way on vocals. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here but I&rsquo;ve found this whole album to be a great late-night listen, full of glossy synth and colossal bass-driven rhythms. Way competes with Cypress Hill, and Imogen Heap (sadly not on the same track!) as MVP guest contributor, but just as many of the instrumental tracks are highlights. Perhaps not one I&rsquo;ll still be playing in five years’ time but I&rsquo;ve given it a fair few spins this winter.</p>
<h3 id="15-liars--wixiw">15. Liars — <em>WIXIW</em></h3>
<p><em>WIXIW</em> is the latest despatch from Liars as they continue to occupy some kind of
weird limbo where music is extrapolated from the more outré elements of
Radiohead&rsquo;s <em>Amnesiac</em>. I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is I find so
appealing about Liars, and yet, like the three albums that precede it (perhaps
2007&rsquo;s self-titled release most of all) I find this stuff endlessly worthy of re-
listening, re-examining, further puzzling over. If anything there&rsquo;s a slight
detectable lightening of the musical palate here, on tracks like ‘No.1 Against the
Rush’, which helps distinguish this record from 2010&rsquo;s <em>Sisterworld</em> - you
couldn&rsquo;t call it a change of direction however, Liars’ direction remains resolutely
undecided.</p>
<h3 id="14-blondes--blondes">14. Blondes — <em>Blondes</em></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled to remember how I cam across this one; most likely it was added
to the stack of new release playlists I tend to build up on a Monday and then not
get around to listening to for months on end. Regardless, once I did get around to
delving into this dense thicket of electronic synth &amp; rhythms I found myself
hooked. There&rsquo;s something appealing about this album&rsquo;s unknowability: its one-
word song titles and stark typographic artwork. It&rsquo;s there in the music too: no
quarter given, no concessions made - an album to take or leave on its merits.
Something about its swooping, echoing calls and 16bit-esque samples caught my
ear.</p>
<h3 id="13-royal-headache--royal-headache">13. Royal Headache — <em>Royal Headache</em></h3>
<p>With an average song length somewhere south of two-and-a-half minutes this is
thrillingly energetic, under-produced garage rock of the purest kind,
accompanied by a flawless ear for infectious melodies &amp; hooks. There&rsquo;s also an
unmistakable buoyancy to it, a non-ironic optimism that you can&rsquo;t help taking on
as you listen. As such it&rsquo;s one of the most fun-loving and simply enjoyable albums
of 2012.</p>
<h3 id="12-wallace-roney--home">12. Wallace Roney — <em>Home</em></h3>
<p>At the start of the year there were a couple of jazz records that I was looking
forward to: Christian Scott&rsquo;s double-disk opus, and the new album from Robert
Glasper. Roney wasn&rsquo;t on my radar at that time, but a couple of great reviews for
<em>Home</em> got me interested, and the album quickly became a headphone favourite
for me. Roney&rsquo;s trumpet is superbly expressive: by turns manic and pacific, and
the overall spread of the album runs all over the tempo and emotional
spectrums. ‘Evolution of the Blues’ is a stand out favourite, as it builds a theme
over eight minutes whilst still allowing room for impressive trumpet and piano
solos. I had though, over the last couple of years, that piano-led jazz was my
flavour of choice but Roney brought brass back in style for me.</p>
<h3 id="11-cloud-nothings--attack-on-memory">11. Cloud Nothings — <em>Attack on Memory</em></h3>
<p>This is a lean, wiry, noisy record from a band I had no familiarity with at the start
of the year. It was Steve Albini&rsquo;s production that first keyed me into this album,
and it remains an essential ingredient in what appeals to me about what is
essentially a post-rock / grunge fusion sound. The space Albini gives the
recording, so that it sounds like it&rsquo;s unfolding live in some otherwise empty
room, is what makes these songs breathe - especially the album centrepiece:
‘Wasted Days’. That track alone is a brave sonic experiment from a band whose
back catalogue is decidedly poppier than <em>Attack on Memory</em> would lead you to
believe. But this isn&rsquo;t just a nostalgia exercise for those of us who haven&rsquo;t heard
anything that sounds like <em>In Utero</em> in a good long while. It&rsquo;s a smart set of dark
rock songs that says everything it has to in 33 minutes and leaves you wanting to
hit play again.</p>
<h3 id="10-four-tet--pink">10. Four Tet — <em>Pink</em></h3>
<p><em>Pink</em> has taken Kieran Hebden quite some time to put together, and reads less
cohesively than previous efforts <em>There is Love in You</em>, <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>
etc. but is no less impressive. Four Tet was one of the artists that opened the
door for me to electronica ten or so years ago, and his prolific output is
still some of my favourite work in the (loose) genre. Hebden can do warm as well
as anyone, whilst still feeling experimental and never stale: ‘Ocoras' is a prime
example. Album highlight for me though is the closer: ‘Pinnacles’, which had a 7&quot;
release least year and has a play count somewhere in the high thirties last time I
looked.</p>
<h3 id="9-regina-spektor--what-we-saw-from-the-cheap-seats">9. Regina Spektor — <em>What We Saw from the Cheap Seats</em></h3>
<p>The twin attractions of a Spektor record are her captivating, somersaulting voice,
and her faultless sense of melodies that stick in your head despite being just the
right degree of off-kilter. It took a while for me to get into this record, but once I
did (once those tunes worked their way in there) it was one that I returned to
just to listen to a track or two with increasing frequency. Before I knew it most of
the album had worked its magic on me. I enjoyed 2009&rsquo;s <em>Far</em> but it fell short of
the album that brought her to my attention: <em>Begin to Hope</em> (2006). This one is
right up there.</p>
<h3 id="8-portico-quartet--portico-quartet">8. Portico Quartet — <em>Portico Quartet</em></h3>
<p>This is one of those tenacious ones: a January release that has stuck it out all year
to claim a place in the top ten. In some ways a pretty unexpected sounding
album, the instrumentation favours the electronic far more than on previous
releases, but its constantly impressive what four talented musicians can conjure
from the less familiar. Tracks like &lsquo;Spinner&rsquo; still feel heavily jazz-influenced, but
they are counterbalanced by the more electronica-esque songs like ‘Rubidium’; it
feels like the album was sequenced with this balance in mind and it works
superbly. I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll still be listening to this one for years, but I&rsquo;m also
intrigued to know where Portico Quartet go next.</p>
<h3 id="7-godspeed-you-black-emperor--allelujah-dont-bend-ascend">7. Godspeed You! Black Emperor — <em>Allelujah! Don&rsquo;t Bend! Ascend!</em></h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get into GY!BE until it was too late, and I would say it has been a long
wait for new material only I didn&rsquo;t really consider it a possibility that there
would ever be any (see also My Bloody Valentine). The four tracks of
<em>Allelujah!&hellip;</em> comprise one of the year&rsquo;s most perfectly coherent albums, to the
degree that it almost makes little sense to consider the tracks separately
appreciable. Opener ‘Mladic’ is one of the finest pieces of music of 2012, but only
because its glacial, intoxicating build over 20 minutes dissipates into the slow
crawl of &lsquo;Their Helicopters Sing’. This is music of considered construction and as
such it seems a cheat to listen to anything less than the full 50+ minutes. That&rsquo;s
something I&rsquo;ve only managed a handful of times this year but I&rsquo;ll be coming back
again - there&rsquo;s something special in here for sure.</p>
<h3 id="6-ben-kweller--go-fly-a-kite">6. Ben Kweller — <em>Go Fly a Kite</em></h3>
<p>After reaching a high with his eponymous album in 2006, Kweller left me a little
cold with 2009&rsquo;s <em>Changing Horses</em>. I applaud the effort at adding something to
the palate but I&rsquo;ve never been able to key into country music to any great extent
and found the tweaks to Kweller&rsquo;s pop-rock sound a little off-putting. It&rsquo;s clear
right out of the gate here that things are back on power-chord, bubblegum
course and once it gets going <em>Go Fly a Kite</em> never really lets up. The jaunty
piano sing-along of &lsquo;Gossip’ is vintage, and Kweller finds a new gear with ‘Justify
Me’ that is thrilling to hear. Looking back over the five post-Radish solo albums
it&rsquo;s very impressive how many great songs this guy has written.</p>
<h3 id="5-islands--a-sleep--a-forgetting">5. Islands — <em>A Sleep &amp; A Forgetting</em></h3>
<p>Islands’ previous album but one, <em>Arm&rsquo;s Way</em>, made an appearance on The List
in 2008, and yet drawing comparisons between that record and this one seems of
little value. (There is also the matter of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Vapours</em> which is a different
animal again.) Islands’ sole defining characteristic is Nick Thorburn - the series
of line-up changes that has altered the face of the band over the last three albums
is difficult to overstate.</p>
<p>All of which is only important in as much as it informs the state of <em>A Sleep &amp; A
Forgetting</em>. A very personal record for Thorburn, written pretty much solo on
piano and released on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, it is perhaps one of the finest modern
examples of that pop staple: the break-up album. In places melancholy, and in
others possessed of an infectious optimism, Thorburn is brilliantly adept at
capturing his mood in song, wrapping melodies perfectly to the feel of his odd,
sometimes touching lyrics.</p>
<p>At its core <em>AS&amp;AF</em> contains some of the year’s most memorable, whistleable,
sing-along-able pop songs, the strength of which would be enough to find it a
place on this list. That it is this high up is owed to the emotional strength and
variety of the material. One of my most played albums this year.</p>
<h3 id="4-bloc-party--four">4. Bloc Party — <em>Four</em></h3>
<p>A couple of years ago when it was announced that Bloc Party were going into
hiatus it didn&rsquo;t feel like a permanent thing. As with the last decade of Silverchair&rsquo;s existence there was always that slight fear that they would drift apart and not find their way back to each other for an extended period, but four
years doesn&rsquo;t seem like an unreasonable length of time to wait, especially as it
saw the release of a very interesting solo album from Kele, which served as an
insight into the presence of different musical impulses within the band.
<em>Four</em> doesn&rsquo;t feel like the product of a divided band at all. It&rsquo;s muscular and
assured in every respect: a definitive statement. There is musical diversity here,
from the tender ballad of &lsquo;Real Talk’ to ‘We Are Not Good People’ at the other end
of the record&rsquo;s (and the band&rsquo;s) spectrum, but it comes across as cohesive and
well built. This is a set of musicians very familiar with each other&rsquo;s strengths and
weaknesses and fully in command of what their band has been and can be.</p>
<p>Repeated listens reveal a multitude of wonderful moments: the seductive bridge
of &lsquo;3X3’, the none-more-angular guitar spine of ‘Octopus’, the Smashing-
Pumpkins-via-Weezer solo in &lsquo;Kettling&rsquo; - and it&rsquo;s out of these that the record as a
whole is built, moving from one to the next with a sure hand and without a
misstep.</p>
<p>The only things to dislike about the record are its poorly conceived cover art and
the soon-irritating spoken interludes between numerous tracks. Luckily both of
these decisions are easily edited out via iTunes, leaving a pretty flawless 21st
century pop-rock album.</p>
<h3 id="3-grimes--visions">3. Grimes — <em>Visions</em></h3>
<p>New discovery of the year goes to Grimes. I stumbled across the video for (album
highlight) ‘Oblivion’ on Pitchfork back in January and was instantly hooked. The
album was one of the first I purchased this year, and between my iPod and the
CD I burned for Elizabeth&rsquo;s car it must be one of my most listened to records of 2012. That I&rsquo;m nowhere near tired of it is a testament to the strength of the
songwriting. From the artwork to the videos and her on-stage abandon you
might not think that &lsquo;subtlety&rsquo; would be Grimes&rsquo;s strength but in large part it&rsquo;s
the ingredient that makes this album work. There&rsquo;s no overindulgence on this
record, which moves sure-footedly around a dance/trance borderland knowing
exactly when a dark bass grove or a distorted vocal is called for, but never
overplaying these elements, content to let the kernel of the album&rsquo;s hypnotic
rhythms do most of the talking.</p>
<p>Also, she is <em>nearly</em> as entertaining <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz">on Twitter</a> as she is on record, so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>
<h3 id="2-metric--synthetica">2. Metric — <em>Synthetica</em></h3>
<p>This is the kind of flawless start-to-finish pop record that only comes along very
rarely. Somehow, over 11 tracks, Metric don&rsquo;t make a single misstep. It&rsquo;s been
one of those rare albums with which I&rsquo;m constantly undecided as to which is my
favourite track. The 40 minute run time fairly flies by in a whirl of soaring hooks,
lap-drummable percussion, and singalong choruses, and I almost always want to
hit play on this again.</p>
<p>At the time of writing my favourite track is probably the perfect night-driving
soundtrack ‘Speed the Collapse’ or the year&rsquo;s best danceable anthem ‘Breathing Underwater’&hellip; or maybe twisted ballad &lsquo;Lost Kitten’. Stop asking me to choose!
For me this record harks back to Garbage at their mid-90s finest. That band&rsquo;s
first two records were very important to me at the time, and still get the odd play
now, but <em>Synthetica</em> may well be better.</p>
<p>..OK, my favourite is ‘Clone’. (Or maybe &lsquo;The Void&rsquo;.)</p>
<h3 id="1-deftones--koi-no-yokan">1. Deftones — <em>Koi No Yokan</em></h3>
<p>Probably having read about it in the darkest corners of <em>Kerrang!</em> magazine, I
still remember putting down far too much money at my local Our Price to import a copy
of 1995&rsquo;s <em>Adrenaline</em>. When it eventually turned up however, the wait and the
money had proved to be well worth it. Unfairly tied to bands from the nu metal
scene emerging at the same time, Deftones never really fit that mould: they were
too melodic, too obtuse and, as the albums moved on, too romantic. <em>Around the
Fur</em> was nothing short of a new gospel to me when it arrived in 1997, and
2000&rsquo;s <em>White Pony</em> is a religious text I still consult regularly today - without
question one of my desert island discs and some days my favourite record of all
time.</p>
<p>Solid and enjoyable as they most certainly are <em>Deftones</em> (2003), and <em>Saturday
Night Wrist</em> (2006) failed to set my world alight as their three predecessors had
done. To listen back to those albums now (and they are still eminently listenable)
sounds to me like a band treading water to some extent; re-working what they
did well with somewhat lesser returns.</p>
<p>When Deftones shelved the almost complete <em>Eros</em> in 2009, following bassist
Chi Cheng&rsquo;s tragic accident (which leaves him in a coma to this day), it felt to me
like an admission that the band were struggling with their own identity. Particularly in the absence of a founding member it must have been incredibly
difficult to grasp what the band stood for anymore. However, with <em>Diamond
Eyes</em>, a soaring and heartfelt tribute to their friend, Deftones secured a place in
my top 10 for 2010. That record was proof that this was still a band capable of
great things and <em>Koi No Yokan</em> is the fulfilment of that promise.
In many ways the culmination of all of Deftones’ strengths, this is a rock
record full of tenderness and passion. As brutal as it is elegiac, and as romantic as
it is bruising. No other band I know of under the sun can fuse these elements so
flawlessly, and in <em>Koi No Yokan</em> Deftones have created something that can
stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with their millennial masterpiece.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NB. Revisiting this decade-old post in 2022, I find that every single link included now returns a 404 error. Usually I make an effort to fix these things when I spot them, but in this particular instance, there&rsquo;s something enjoyable about the irony.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A few years ago it suddenly became inescapable that the web was a place for sharing. Though that had been the very idea of the technology from the beginning the majority of web content in the early years was static. Traffic was quantified in page impressions and publishing schedules were closer to the old print models: glacial by today&rsquo;s standards. It took a while for Prometheus to get the fire to the people, but with the launch of Blogger and similar services around the turn of the century individual voices grew louder in the conversation. In the last ten years the explosion of the web as a social space has been exponential; not only is social networking the primary use of the internet for a majority of people, to an increasing degree it also underpins every other area of the web.</p>
<p>Wanting to share is a natural reaction to coming across content you enjoy online, and a vast array of web services sprang up to facilitate that. For a while it was a relatively common occurrence to come across massive and unwieldy lists of sharing options next to every article, news story, blog post, and video. The meteoric popularity of Facebook, and the rise of services like Twitter &amp; Tumblr (as well as a proliferation of link shorteners) over the past few years has consolidated the sharing traffic somewhat. In place of the sprawling lists of a couple of dozen services it&rsquo;s now common to see two or three options - but you still see them everywhere. The social underpinning of the web has become the province of a handful of services, and that has both positive and negative repercussions. When your goal is to quickly and effectively share content you like with your friends it helps that they are all using one of a handful of services, or at least services that play well together. However, as the user base grows and the power in the sharing ecosystem consolidates things tend to move towards the siloing of content rather than the liberation of it. Put another way: as service x becomes used to their position as the most popular and powerful way to share a particular type of content their desire grows that they should be the default or <em>only</em> way to share that content.</p>
<p>Recently we&rsquo;ve seen exactly this type of posturing from social media&rsquo;s biggest players. First users lose the ability to find their Twitter contacts on Instagram, then users lose the ability to see Instagram images inline in their Twitter feed. In both cases users lose. Apple&rsquo;s latest mobile &amp; desktop OSs include easy sharing to Twitter &amp; Facebook, but Google+ users are frozen out; on Android devices things work the other way. The state of the social web right now is that a handful of huge parties are jockeying for primacy, and users are caught in the middle.</p>
<p>None of this should be a surprise. Facebook &amp; Twitter are businesses, and the continued existence of the services they provide is dependent on their ability to be profitable. The construction of distinct silos makes operational sense as it allows these businesses to guarantee to advertisers the conditions under which their adverts will be seen. Advertising money is the sole lifeblood of services that are free to users, and keeping it flowing is at the center of every decision made regarding how the services operate. Users' experience, and even the service&rsquo;s usefulness become secondary considerations.</p>
<p>In the wake of Instagram&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening">recent U-turn</a> on content ownership, and as the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">Twitter API</a> farrago rumbles on, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how I use the social web. I have accounts with both Facebook &amp; Google+ but use both only rarely. The signal to noise ratio on social platforms of this type seems wildly unbalanced, and though the former has the advantage of having most of my family &amp; friends as active users it is the worst offender in terms of opaque privacy regulation and prevalence of advertising. Google+ is presently streamlined by comparison and has the advantage of being increasingly integrated into services I already use; amongst people I know however, the adoption rate has been low. In both cases I find the tools at users' disposal a little constraining: with the exception of an avatar and a header image there is no possibility of template personalisation (where would the adverts go!?), and the manner in which text, photos, video and everything else is displayed is dictated by the platform rather than the user.</p>
<p>Tumblr represents a strange middle ground. Since the dashboard through which users consume content can be utilised for (relatively non-obtrusive) advertising, there is no need for it to be included amidst the content users create. As such there is no requirement for advertising spaces within site templates and a far greater degree of personalisation is permissible. I like Tumblr, and aim to make more use of it going forward as a space to share content from around the web. That is undoubtedly what the platform does best, and whilst it can quite easily also be used to run a primary blog I&rsquo;m not convinced that it has all of the tools in place to compete with the established dedicated blogging services.</p>
<p>I love Twitter, and of all of the social services I find it by far the most useful, entertaining and compelling. That I connect to the service entirely via third-party applications is not in Twitter&rsquo;s best business interests, and like many I&rsquo;m pretty concerned about what the API changes mean for the service&rsquo;s future. I signed up to App.net out of curiosity for what a social network funded by users rather than advertisers could accomplish. Though it&rsquo;s still young there is the promise of some very interesting functionality to come, and the hope has to be that a paid service&rsquo;s independence from advertising will be protection against the onset of siloing in the future.</p>
<p>As Warren Ellis suggests in the blogpost linked below &ldquo;It feels like the social web is going to get somewhat less interesting for a while. Less connected, less engaged&rdquo;. Since the very construction of the web is based around communication and sharing, changes to the manner in which those activities are conducted online are likely to be felt widely. Personally I find it difficult to believe that in ten or even five years' time the discrete services we see today will be the norm. The current trend towards non-interoperability is most likely to be temporary, and service providers will in time learn that it makes business sense to corral content only to the extent that doing so doesn&rsquo;t infringe on your users' experience and your service&rsquo;s usefulness. I may choose an iPhone and Gmail where you prefer your Windows Phone and Outlook, but neither choice makes any sense if we can&rsquo;t call or write to each other.<br>

			 <p>Of the three resolutions I made for 2012 I would have thought that running 300km was the one I was most likely to fall short of. I had also aimed for 100 complete chess games and 100 hours of zazen this year, and though I don&rsquo;t have exact numbers I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ve fallen woefully short of both of those marks. (There&rsquo;s always next year.)</p>
<p>Writing this on 1 December I&rsquo;ve currently racked up 257km; that leaves four weeks and two days to put in the final 43km. At one point, in early summer, it looked like it was going to be easy. The &lsquo;couch to 5k&rsquo; regime we were following had got us up to nearly 3km per run fairly quickly, and we were going out three times per week. By June we were comfortably running 5km each outing, sometimes more. Upwards of 50km went on the board for April, then May, then June… it looked like 300km by the end of the year was going to be no problem.</p>
<p>In early July we went away to the British Grand Prix, which (combined with some horrendous weather) wiped out a week of running. That led straight into a few days in Herefordshire for my sister&rsquo;s wedding, and again I didn&rsquo;t take my running gear. Looking back now, when I went out on 17 July, having not run in a fortnight, I pushed too hard. My body wasn&rsquo;t ready for what I was asking of it after two weeks of not making the effort, and something went in my left knee. I tried to go out again the next week, but only managed a little over 2km each time before I had to turn around and limp home.</p>
<p>It was a difficult thing to deal with. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it when we first started I had grown to really enjoy running. To suddenly find myself incapable of it was hard to accept. I found some exercises to strengthen the knee, tried swimming, and waited. I went out once in August, and twice in September, wearing a strap and conscious of the tightness building behind my patella. Though I tried to remain patient and be accepting of my injury I think to some extent I gave up a little. Running changed from being something I enjoyed into something that hurt, that I wasn&rsquo;t very capable at. Then circumstances changed in my work life and I wasn&rsquo;t home in the evenings, which was when we&rsquo;d commonly run. Between one thing and another I didn&rsquo;t lace my running shoes back up until late October, but the 3km circuit we did was a revelation: no pain, relatively small drop-off in stamina, and really enjoyable. It suddenly felt like this was something I was going to be able to make part of my life again.</p>
<p>Working out what was left to do if I was to meet my 300km goal, and the time left to do it in left me cautiously optimistic. It wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy but if I could get back to something like my pace and stamina of summer then it looked achievable.</p>
<p>Thirty-one days; forty-three kilometres; an average temperature somewhere in the single digits… wish me luck.</p>

			 <p>Film is a manipulative art form. Much of its effectiveness is derived from its ability to make us <em>feel</em>. We are carried along with the sweep of a well-executed dolly shot, or tricked by a jump-cut; we are caught up by the story&rsquo;s pace as determined in the editing room; our emotional response is keyed to and prompted by the score. The rudiments of film construction are all centred upon affecting the audience. Though that may read like a cynical view of the medium, it is in fact to cinema&rsquo;s great credit that it has evolved such a <em>direct</em> connection to viewers.</p>
<p>For me there are perhaps no films more manipulative than those in the James Bond franchise. Like many filmgoers of my age (and older) I grew up with James Bond. <em>License to Kill</em> (1989) was the first entry in the series I saw in a cinema, when I was 8 years of age. It may well have been before that that I had started to accumulate other Bond films, recorded off Christmas television for endless replaying on our top-loading Betamax machine.</p>
<p>One of the great draws of these films is the famous components that one expects to find in each instalment. There is something comforting in the inevitable introduction: &ldquo;Bond, James Bond&rdquo;, in the familiar strains of that theme song, and in knowing our hero&rsquo;s drink order. When so many elements of the piece are predefined, from the surrealistic music video title sequence to the promise during the credits that &lsquo;James Bond will return&rsquo;, it might seem that the screenwriter and director have a relatively easy job on their hands. String together a few action scenes set in exotic locales, add a dose of sex, a fist fight, and a car chase or two and send the thing out wrapped in a bow-tie. Looked at another way however, all of those expected elements are also constraints, waypoint markers from which the filmmakers must not stray too far.</p>
<p>This is the balance with which the two Bond films preceding <em>Skyfall</em> struggled. <em>Casino Royale</em> (2006), by taking Ian Fleming&rsquo;s first Bond novel as its template, was rooted in the history of the character, but also sought to reboot the franchise with a grittier tone more akin to that established by Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass in the first two Jason Bourne films for Universal. Whilst many of the familiar tropes were in place the film, and its sequel <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008), lacked the wit that had characterised many of the series' previous entries. It felt as though the films' creators were trying to wrestle all of the franchise&rsquo;s peccadilloes into a new form, which left the results feeling straight-jacketed and unfulfilling. The post-Bourne, post-War on Terror straight-facedness of this new Bond did well at the box office and won over more than a few critics, but did so at the expense of some of the more human traits of the character and the series as a whole.</p>
<p>This is clearly a problem with which screenwriters John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade, and director Sam Mendes engaged in shaping <em>Skyfall</em>. From the script level up the film is proudly indebted to its ancestry, and manages to go about the work of updating it in a more sure-footed manner than its two immediate predecessors. Instead of wholesale adoption of other series' stylistic choices the film takes the time to actively engage with Bond&rsquo;s past and to assess what place the character has in the modern world, and by extension modern cinema. So, whilst the film reintroduces the role of Q (sorely missing in the two Craig outings thus far), it makes explicit with a couple of lines of dialogue that there will be no &lsquo;exploding pens&rsquo; of the type wielded by Pierce Brosnan in <em>GoldenEye</em> (1995). The iconic Aston Martin DB5 is reprised as Bond&rsquo;s car of choice, and the advent of a new Miss Moneypenny is welcome, as is her reinvention as a capable former field agent.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <em>Skyfall</em> is hands-down the most strikingly beautiful Bond movie to date. Mendes&rsquo;s style is impressively assured: his confidence in the material signalled by the use of a signature musical sting accompanying the film&rsquo;s very first image, and his confidence in Bond as an icon extending to a willingness to let key scenes play out entirely in silhouette. The film also marks yet another impressive entry in the exemplary career of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Many of the locations (especially Shanghai and Macau) and the shots that establish them are nothing short of breathtaking. But the real strength of <em>Skyfall</em> is the surety with which it navigates the balance of nostalgia and modernisation. Now entering its sixth decade as a film franchise it is remarkable that Sam Mendes has crafted a movie that balances the past and future of Bond so perfectly. The script, in the wording of Bond&rsquo;s (premature) obituary, openly recognises the character&rsquo;s role as &ldquo;emblematic of British fortitude&rdquo;, and the sense of Bond as symbol is strong throughout. He&rsquo;s compared by Q to an old warship, and equated by the film&rsquo;s villain with an antiquated way of doing things. At each turn the film is examining how and whether Bond fits.</p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s villain is also a device through which Bond&rsquo;s own place is examined. A former agent and a previous protégé of M&rsquo;s, Silva is a mirror image of Bond. Like Conrad’s (&amp; Coppolla&rsquo;s) Kurtz  he is a brilliant operative gone rogue - at once a reminder and an indictment of the rules within which Bond exists. Previous villains in the series are roughly divisible into two categories: those who attack Bond through influence of their minds (Blofeld, Goldfinger et al) and those who pose a physical threat (Jaws, Red Grant etc.). Silva is different in that he is principally a threat to Bond&rsquo;s heart &amp; soul. A similar trick is being played here as is performed in Chris Nolan&rsquo;s <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), in which The Joker&rsquo;s aim is squarely on undermining Batman&rsquo;s values before anything else. Here, as in Nolan&rsquo;s film, it serves to reveal truths about Bond&rsquo;s character. Whilst he fails every test of physical fitness and mental acuity required to return to active service, M gives her approval of 007&rsquo;s return to the field based on what she knows of his spirit - the second and third acts of the film are trials to Bond through which M&rsquo;s judgement is proven correct. Bond is literally sent back to his roots, to the abandoned family home from which his trauma stems, and proves himself - within a stone&rsquo;s throw of his parents' gravestones - to be everything he attests to be. Mendes echoes the film&rsquo;s opening, in which Bond falls to his supposed death amid a surging river, by sending James back underwater to fight for his life - his self-proclaimed hobby of &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; put to the test.</p>
<p>And with <em>Skyfall</em> Mendes has brought new purpose to a franchise which had felt somewhat directionless in recent years. Unquestionably a new Bond, but one that feels firmly grounded in an understanding of and and acceptance of the character&rsquo;s place in cinema history.  Bond&rsquo;s inclusion in the 2012 London Olympics' opening ceremony is a sign of his iconic status not just in British culture but universally. The lines from Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; that feature prominently at the culmination of the film&rsquo;s second act, seem to speak directly to the question of Britain&rsquo;s place in the modern world, and also to the matter of James Bond&rsquo;s place in modern cinema.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not now that strength which in the old days<br>
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are,<br>
One equal-temper of heroic hearts,<br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also that line, repeated by several characters throughout the film and easily read as a direct acknowledgement that not every change has been for the better: &ldquo;Sometimes the old ways are the best&rdquo;. Not reinvention then, but resurrection.</p>

			 <p>A little over two years ago I took the decision to leave my job in London and return to higher education. Committing myself to a further two years of study and ~£4,000 in fees was not a decision I took lightly, but it had been my goal since graduation to take this next step in my academic career. I enjoy enormously the expansion of knowledge and the refinement of understanding. There is no feeling like being deeply engaged in learning something new.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve very much enjoyed reading for my MA, but it was also a test - as it should be. I took classes in American Modernism, Postcolonial Fiction, Modernist Poetry, and the Postmodern Novel, and I wrote my thesis on American Minimalism. I got to be surrounded by the best resources possible for the pursuit of my passion, and by people who share it. It&rsquo;s been my pleasure to share seminar rooms with some inspiring academics and some really talented fellow students. In all it has been a wonderful way to spend a couple of years, and has more than lived up to what I had hoped to gain from the experience.</p>
<p>Today I learned that when I graduate next month it will be with a distinction. It&rsquo;s good to know that all of the hard work has paid off and that I have met the goal I set myself when I took this all on. The greater reward however, has been in the work itself and in that which I take away from the classrooms and the libraries and the conversations which is of infinitely more value than any certificate.</p>
<p>OK, what&rsquo;s next?</p>

			 <p>Over the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been having a problem with my Mac. When I start the machine up and enter my login password, instead of displaying the Apple logo for a while whilst booting up I&rsquo;ve been getting strings of white-on-black text streaming down the left side of the screen&hellip; then a message that the machine needs to restart.</p>
<p>A little poking around has enabled me to find out that this error is called a &lsquo;kernel panic&rsquo;, though I haven&rsquo;t got very far in determining what causes it. It seems kernel panics can be brought on by any number of problems, either with a system&rsquo;s hardware or its software. I&rsquo;ve kept the report logs from the crashes but they&rsquo;re more or less indecipherable to me - which is where the experts come in.</p>
<p>Today I had an appointment at my nearest Genius Bar and took my MacBook in to be looked at. (Just FYI: it&rsquo;s a late 2010 model w/ 4GB of RAM, running OS X Mountain Lion.) The guy who looked at it for me had all the info I&rsquo;d sent through at hand on an iPad, but that and the logs he pulled up from the console didn&rsquo;t give a definitive picture of where the problem lay. I was half expecting them to say that it wasn&rsquo;t a diagnosable problem and tell me to come back if it got worse. But that isn&rsquo;t the way that Apple do business: there was no question that they needed to get to the bottom of the issue, so I had to sign the computer into their care for a few days.</p>
<p>Leaving the Apple store without my Mac, knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t have it to hand for at least a few days (maybe as long as three weeks) felt very odd. I found myself immediately calculating what the implications would be for my daily digital activities. Most things I balance between Mac &amp; iPhone anyway, depending upon which is to hand: email, Twitter, RSS feeds etc. All of my music is still on tap thanks to Spotify and iTunes Match; photos are all backed up to Dropbox and hence still available via iOS or any web browser; I can still post to Tumblr, Instagram et al via iPhone&hellip; I&rsquo;m still plugged in.</p>
<p>Longform reading &amp; writing were likely to be the biggest hurdle. I&rsquo;ve never got used to reading lots of text on a phone screen; I uninstalled Instapaper through lack of use a while ago, tending instead to save articles to Pinboard to catch up with on a larger screen later. At this moment I&rsquo;m resigned to building up a bit of a backlog in this way, though I know I also have the option (via Instapaper) to send articles to my Kindle - that might be something worth playing with if the days without a laptop become weeks.</p>
<p>Writing, on the other hand, I quickly found a workable solution to. The iOS version of Information Architects' <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">iA Writer</a>, combined with a bluetooth connection to my wireless Mac keyboard makes for an ideal writing set-up: distraction free, and as comfortable as I choose to make it, it&rsquo;s also an ultra-portable way of working that I can take from the couch to the train without any hassle. There&rsquo;s an added bonus: my Documents folder on my MacBook is symlinked to Dropbox, to which iA Writer has full read / write access, so I still have all of my docs to hand and editable. Since I write pretty much everything in markdown format these days plaintext isn&rsquo;t even really a limitation.</p>
<p>OK, right now I&rsquo;m going to post this to Wordpress via the beautiful and super-useful iOS app Poster. I&rsquo;ll keep you updated on life without a laptop. How it limits or changes my online life, whether it makes me think differently about the mobile web, and whether I should be making such a big deal about this in the first place!</p>

			 <p>It’s a weird phenomenon to mourn the passing of someone you never knew. Or perhaps I should say met, rather than knew, because when it comes to artists whose work is important to you there’s always that feeling that you at least know them a little - know a part of them anyway. When the news started to spread on Friday about the death of Adam Yauch from cancer I felt keenly something like loss. I’ve been a Beastie Boys fan since the mid 90s, so there was a sense of contact there, but Yauch was such an inspiring human being in a lot of ways beyond just the music. Humility and passivity are in short supply in hip-hop. Actually those qualities are rare in the world at large, but rap is not a good place to start looking. Which is just one of many reasons that Yauch, Horowitz and Diamond stood apart from the pack. From crude beginnings they grew into thoughtful, principled artists who nevertheless avoided the trap of taking themselves too seriously.</p>
<p>One thing that the Beasties came to represent to me was the possibility of change and growth. Raw and purile in the beginning, they evolved both their style and what they stood for throughout a long career, and had the grace to admit to their failings. As lifelong goofballs with a political conscience they also stood as license not to limit yourself be it musically, intellectually or in any other sphere of life. To my mind their 2004 album <em>To The Five Boroughs</em> remains the finest artistic response to the events of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>When Yauch was diagnosed with cancer in 2009 it came as a surprise. He was young and seemed healthy even in the video in which he gave fans the news. And even though an album got delayed and there had been no shows in quite a while I don’t think it really ever sunk in that he was sick - after all, he was still directing completely insane <a href="http://youtu.be/evA-R9OS-Vo">half-hour music videos</a>. One message that really hit home with me on Friday said simply ‘I don’t think I can live in a world where a Beastie Boy can die’</p>
<p>A smart, kind, funny, basketball fan. A father. An activist, <a href="https://www.beastiemania.com/whois/hornblower_nathanial/">Swiss-impersonator</a>, vegan, Buddhist, and incredibly talented artist. It feels like a lot to lose all at once.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Something interesting popped up on Twitter recently which got me thinking about the way I&rsquo;m using a certain word, and the way I&rsquo;m thinking about a certain concept: &lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo;. On the surface it&rsquo;s a really useful word, capturing in three neat syllables the entire idea of paying more attention to one&rsquo;s surroundings, the moment you find yourself in, and everything else in between. There&rsquo;s <em>mindful</em> walking, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/dining/mindful-eating-as-food-for-thought.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mindful%20eating&amp;st=cse"><em>mindful</em> eating</a>, I&rsquo;ve even heard of <em>mindful</em> brushing of teeth - and it&rsquo;s all useful stuff, or at least it can be.</p>
<p>Recently, on Twitter, Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (or someone acting on his behalf) posted a message advocating the mindful appreciation of a sunrise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you contemplate the big, full sunrise, the more mindful &amp; concentrated you are, the more the beauty of the sunrise is revealed to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK – so far so fridge magnet; what could possibly be wrong with that you might think. But another Buddhist monk took issue with the post, <a href="https://twitter.com/BradWarner/status/176673178142257152">replying</a> &lsquo;Sounds to me like mindfulness would get in the way of the sunrise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Warner followed up with <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/thich-naht-hanh-is-wrong/164">a blogpost</a> explaining his take on the matter, and it makes for interesting reading. The crux of the argument is that the way in which Hanh uses &lsquo;mindful&rsquo; speaks too neatly to the basest quick-fix, self-help instinct, and therefore actually works against its own cause. As Warner points out, there shouldn&rsquo;t be room for admonition in this instruction; this isn&rsquo;t about a right or wrong way of seeing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, of course, that Warner is misreading Hanh&rsquo;s intention, or that Hanh&rsquo;s intent was mistranslated by whomever tweeted it for him. Regardless, it&rsquo;s added something to the way I think about &lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo;; I&rsquo;ll let you know if it changes how I brush my teeth.</p>

			 <p>The first time I watched David Lynch&rsquo;s 2006 film <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>, I sat with my laptop open and did some kind of unfiltered, automatic typing throughout the 3-hour running time. Lynch&rsquo;s visceral, surrealistic brand of film-making arguably makes it a legitimate form of criticism to attempt to capture one&rsquo;s raw, unprocessed reaction. And whilst the long, non-sensical document I had at the end of the process was of dubious critical value it at least served as a genuine record partly of the action of the film, and partly of my immediate reaction to it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The discussion taking place at the BFI this afternoon were of a more thoughtful kind. Taking place as part of the current Lynch season on London&rsquo;s Southbank the study day, billed <em>David Lynch: In Dreams</em>, focussed on the &lsquo;dream worlds&rsquo; of the director&rsquo;s work. Though this might seem like a relatively narrow focus, the discussion was framed in such a way as to accomplish several different views on Lynch&rsquo;s films, as well as on some of his work outside of the cinema.</p>
<h3 id="ruth-roses--revolver">Ruth, Roses &amp; Revolver</h3>
<p>The first part of the afternoon was a screening of a 1987 episode of the BBC arts program <em>Arena</em>, in which Lynch talks the viewer through excerpts from nine of his favourite surrealistic works from the formative days of cinema. Though some of the work in question (incl. pieces by Duchamp, Man Ray, and Cocteau) felt more successful than other pieces, it was an interesting insight into the cinematic roots of Lynch&rsquo;s own style. As the afternoon progressed speakers linked Lynch&rsquo;s work to psychoanalysis and to the novelistic tradition of southern gothic, but throughout the day the strongest cinematic ancestors remained these bizarre European works.</p>
<h3 id="bungalow-dreams-maya-deren-to-david-lynch">Bungalow Dreams: Maya Deren to David Lynch</h3>
<p>The first presentation of the day came from John David Rhodes, who spoke on the impact Los Angeles' architecture had had upon its filmic product. The most interesting idea, which Rhodes made with recourse mainly to film noir, was that the prevalence of the bungalow in golden-era LA inspired a certain kind of editing and narrative flow: no corridors separating rooms, and no entrance hall leading to a tenuousness of the private / public and exterior / interior dualities.</p>
<p>Rhodes struggled a little to situate his thesis specifically within Lynch&rsquo;s work, but his discussion of &lsquo;contiguity, similarity and displacement&rsquo; in both architecture and psychology was interesting enough on its own.</p>
<h3 id="the-elephant-in-the-living-room-man">The Elephant in the Living Room Man</h3>
<p>The second presentation, by Ben Halligan, was also couched in terms more generally cinematic than specific to Lynch&rsquo;s work. The most vibrant idea, from a paper which convincingly positioned Hitchcock as precursor to Lynch, was that modernist surrealism took a didactic, outward-looking form in search of answers; postmodernist surrealism however, was characterised by its inward-looking, reflective quality.</p>
<h3 id="nightmares-in-a-lynchian-brain">Nightmares in a Lynchian Brain</h3>
<p>Third presenter Michael Goddard did a good job of positioning his discussion generally within certain schools of film theory and more specifically within Lynch&rsquo;s loose trilogy of <em>Lost Highway</em>, <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, and <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>.</p>
<p>Personally I found the cursory discussion of film structure as directly related to the topography of the human brain to be a little hard to grasp, but one of Goddard&rsquo;s other contentions did strike a chord which resonated throughout the afternoon. The idea that the surrealist tendency is towards a de-naturalising of the material so as to purposefully invalidate attempts at monolithic interpretation is very interesting. It speaks both to some of the novels we&rsquo;ve been reading as a group on this term&rsquo;s Postmodern Fiction course (e.g. Pynchon&rsquo;s <em>V</em>, and Ishmael Reed&rsquo;s <em>Mumbo Jumbo</em>), and to the PhD proposal I&rsquo;ve been pitching recently on Keatsian negative capability in modernist fiction.</p>
<p>Goddard also made repeated mention of what he termed &lsquo;aberrant networks&rsquo; in Lynch&rsquo;s work. The more he used the term the more I started to see them everywhere, in one form or another (social, spacial, technological…), in the films.</p>
<h3 id="dreams-that-money-can-buy">Dreams That Money Can Buy</h3>
<p>The day&rsquo;s final presentation, by London College of Communication lecturer Anthony Todd was the most Lynch-centric, and the least theoretical. Todd focussed on Lynch&rsquo;s work in advertising, and the question of how we can relate it to his cinematic (and other artistic) works. More questions were posed than answers attempted, and Todd gave half of his time over to a screening of Lynch&rsquo;s 16-minute Dior advert, <em>Lady Blue Shanghai</em>, which whilst interesting did not really further his argument.</p>
<p>Indeed the question of how best to reconcile Lynch the advertiser with Lynch the film-maker (not to mention the coffee purveyor, transcendental meditation guru, and musician etc.) spilled over into the Q&amp;A session which concluded the afternoon. All of the speakers returned as a panel, and provided thoughtful and thought-provoking responses to some good audience questions. The Hitchcock / Lynch link was raised again, as was the influence of Freud. Most interestingly there was some brief mention of the idea of Lynch&rsquo;s films creating a liminal space into which to lead the audience; I&rsquo;ve come across the idea of liminality before, whilst researching an essay on Conrad&rsquo;s <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, but hadn&rsquo;t thought of it in terms of cinema.</p>
<p>I also liked the notion raised that part of the project of <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em> was a wilful destruction of the aesthetics of <em>Mulholland Drive</em> - that seems like a good excuse to re-watch both. In fact I&rsquo;ll be back at the BFI on 21 Feb for a screening of <em>IE</em>, this time without my laptop.</p>

<p>This was a crazy sleeper for me, and even now it just creeps in at the bottom. Much as I love the first two records from this band (and the EP from last year for that matter), this album never clicked for me. If it were an album by a new band I would have given up on it after a couple of listens, but I know what CWK are capable of, and after a half-dozen plays I started to find it. There&rsquo;s still good stuff here, it just feels a little more dilute than previously, and certain tracks (e.g. &lsquo;Royal Blue&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Sensitive Kid&rsquo;) are plain irksome.</p>
<h3 id="19-rival-schools--pedals">19. Rival Schools — <em>Pedals</em></h3>
<p>A long time coming, and in some respects it&rsquo;s like they never went away. Schreifels' voice is immediately recognisable, and still has the same emotive power and limited range as previously; the sonic make-up of the album as a whole is very similar to <em>United By Fate</em>. That there is a span of 10 years separating the records and yet they sound like they could be from the same recording session is about all there is to know. I&rsquo;m still fond of this music, but it&rsquo;s a nostalgic fondness; it would have been nice to have seen some experimentation.</p>
<h3 id="18-rem--collapse-into-now">18. R.E.M. — <em>Collapse Into Now</em></h3>
<p>And so it comes to pass that one of the most long-standing and consistently interesting rock bands calls time on its career. When the album was released we didn&rsquo;t know it would be R.E.M.&rsquo;s final studio record, which is to its benefit as it deserves to be assessed on its own merits. What we have here is not revolutionary, not nearly a match for their finest work, not quite a match for 2008&rsquo;s <em>Accelerate</em>, and yet it&rsquo;s beautifully made and possessed of many great moments and a couple of great songs. The legacy was set in stone by 1992, but this isn&rsquo;t a bad noise to go out to.</p>
<h3 id="17-say-hi-to-your-mom--um-uh-oh">17. Say Hi To Your Mom — <em>Um, Uh Oh</em></h3>
<p>A seemingly effortless encapsulation of all that is best in so-called &lsquo;indie&rsquo; music, without falling into the genre&rsquo;s worst traits. Opener &lsquo;Dots On Maps&rsquo; is one of the year&rsquo;s catchiest singer-songwriter efforts, and it&rsquo;s followed, in &lsquo;Devils&rsquo;, by a song groovier than one man making music in his apartment has a right to be. This LP is shot through with charm and neat observation, great lyricism and catchy tunes that feel sculpted in the ease with which they sit warmly atop the brain. Zero pretention, just great songs.</p>
<h3 id="16-j-live--spta-said-person-of-that-ability">16. J-Live — <em>S.P.T.A. (Said Person Of That Ability)</em></h3>
<p>My discovery of J-Live&rsquo;s <em>All of the Above</em> stands as one of the formative moments in my love of hip-hop; alongside Buck 65&rsquo;s <em>Square</em>, and Edan&rsquo;s <em>Primitive Plus</em> it expanded my ideas about what rap was capable of. I&rsquo;ve been waiting almost 10 years for him to match it, and despite good moments with the last two albums (2005 &amp; &lsquo;08) it was clear from first listen that this was the record I&rsquo;d been hoping for. Laid-back, smooth delivery combined with dense, intelligent lyricism and warm beats make this easy to listen to and rewarding to re-listen to. Great stuff.</p>
<h3 id="15-tv-on-the-radio--nine-types-of-light">15. TV On The Radio — <em>Nine Types Of Light</em></h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a consistent level of quality that you know you&rsquo;re going to get from a TVOTR record, and <em>Nine Types Of Light</em> doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The material here, if not quite as instantly memorable as that on <em>Dear Science</em>, is wall-to-wall engaging rhythms and hum-along vocal lines. You&rsquo;d have to try hard not to be charmed by this music, and though it doesn&rsquo;t completely live up to the standard of its predecessor it&rsquo;s still of enormously high-quality. (R.I.P. Gerard Smith)</p>
<h3 id="14-floex--zorya">14. Floex — <em>Zorya</em></h3>
<p>On which one-man Czech electronica producer Tomáš Dvoák creates some of the most enchanting, beautiful music of 2011. Almost tidal in its gentle pacing, but enhanced with elements such as a jazz clarinet (&lsquo;Casanova&rsquo;) or an ethereal female vocal (&lsquo;Nel Blu&rsquo;) this caught hold of me straight away. The string heavy &lsquo;Veronika&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;, and the impressively lyrical &lsquo;Precious Creature&rsquo; are highlights for me on an album I loved from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="13-wild-flag--wild-flag">13. Wild Flag — <em>Wild Flag</em></h3>
<p>This record came as an unexpected pleasure: one of the year&rsquo;s best surprises. Having heard the single &lsquo;Glass Tambourine&rsquo; from SXSW coverage I had been waiting impatiently for the album to come out, not really knowing what to expect from it. I hadn&rsquo;t dared to hope that it would be of quite this high a quality, devoid of any pretention about its genesis, and just this much pure fun. This is joyful pop-rock made by musicians who sound like they&rsquo;re having a lot of fun doing so. There&rsquo;s a bushel of excellent 3-minute pop songs, balanced with a couple of more ambitious tracks like &lsquo;Racehorse&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s a balance that works perfectly.</p>
<h3 id="12-lykke-li--wounded-rhymes">12. Lykke Li — <em>Wounded Rhymes</em></h3>
<p>A couple of years ago I downloaded the second Bat For Lashes LP not really knowing what to expect from a follow-up to such a singular debut. I found myself in a similar position on release day for the second Lykke Li album: was it going to sound like <em>Youth Novels</em>, or (a, seemingly, equally likely scenario) was she going to spin out in a completely different direction altogether? In the end it turns out that the former is closer to the truth, though <em>Wounded Rhymes</em> exhibits a sure-footedness beyond the idiosyncrasies of the first album, and perhaps a touch of darkness that wasn&rsquo;t present before. That&rsquo;s not to say that this is Lykke Li&rsquo;s <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, but there&rsquo;s a notable shift to darker tones in some places, even if the music remains pleasingly wrapped around bombastic percussion and pretty, melancholic vocal lines. Turns out that&rsquo;s all she had to do this time - but what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<h3 id="11-foo-fighters--wasting-light">11. Foo Fighters — <em>Wasting Light</em></h3>
<p>Holy smokes? This has been a long time coming. Speaking as someone who adored the first three Foos records, and has endured everything since 1999 with decreasing levels of interest and rising levels of contempt, <em>Wasting Light</em> comes as something of a surprise, and a very welcome one. To me this is a turn around of almost (not quite) <em>Death Magnetic</em> proportions: a genuinely exciting rock album full of grade-A riffs, powerfully delivered vocals (and lyrics that don&rsquo;t (always) suck), and a self-assuredness earned after 15+ years in the business. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier that Grohl et al made this album; I honestly doubted that they still had it in them.</p>
<h3 id="10-emmy-the-great--virtue">10. Emmy The Great — <em>Virtue</em></h3>
<p>Spoiler time: there is no Laura Marling album on this list. For whatever reason <em>A Creature I Do Not Know</em> failed to capture my imagination much: it seemed to be lacking the infectiousness of Marling&rsquo;s first two albums, ending up feeling a little watered-down and less than vital. By contrast Emmy The Great&rsquo;s second album is thrillingly alive, rich in colour and packed with wonderful tunes. There&rsquo;s a joy to this music, and it&rsquo;s delivered with unmistakable passion, but it&rsquo;s also tonally diverse: &lsquo;Creation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Iris&rsquo; seemingly belong at different ends of a spectrum, but they are both built assuredly with the tools of an impressive songwriter.</p>
<h3 id="9-battles--gloss-drop">9. Battles — <em>Gloss Drop</em></h3>
<p>Nothing all year sounded like this. Maybe nothing since Battles&rsquo; debut sounded like this. I was somewhat worried, last year, by the departure from the band of Tyondai Braxton: it seemed an obvious equation at the time that a Battles LP without him would be something lesser than the debut, but for whatever reason it hasn&rsquo;t worked out that way. <em>Gloss Drop</em> contains more energy and freneticism than any three other art-rock records combined (John Stanier&rsquo;s drumming in particular is, frankly, ridiculous), and the very fact that it&rsquo;s harnessed into roughly song-shaped bursts between one and eight minutes is impressive. This record comes across like the love child of Mars Volta &amp; The Go! Team, but with more glitter and streamers.</p>
<h3 id="8-das-racist--relax">8. Das Racist — <em>Relax</em></h3>
<p>So, my favourite hip-hop LP of the year is from an NY trio with a penchant for obscure humour and a talent for word-play so intricate that it takes weeks of re-listens to begin to pick it apart. And then all that is true about <em>this</em> record too. Relax has been on repeat for me for a long while as I switch my favourite lines on almost every listen and always find something new that makes me smile with how clever or arch it is. The production is all warm synths and crunchy beats, and all three members have the sort of laid-back flow that makes me fall in love with listening to this record first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening: a great wind-up/down album and one of my most listened to in the latter half of the year.</p>
<h3 id="7-pj-harvey--let-england-shake">7. PJ Harvey — <em>Let England Shake</em></h3>
<p>I can hear it now: the glockenspiel melody that opens this album is one of 2011&rsquo;s most indelible sounds. Unfortunately, for me, the horn which ruins the next track of the album is a close runner-up. But that&rsquo;s one misstep on an otherwise masterful record of truly haunting, thought-provoking and beautiful music. Musically complex and unafraid of difficulty, the album remains accessible by virtue of being so pretty almost throughout. It&rsquo;s by no means an optimistic album, but there&rsquo;s a lot of life in there and I always felt I came away from listening to it feeling like I&rsquo;d gained something.</p>
<h3 id="6-bright-eyes--the-peoples-key">6. Bright Eyes — <em>The People&rsquo;s Key</em></h3>
<p>Though a little more rock-oriented than much of their previous output this record is unmistakably from the people who brought you <em>Lifted…</em> and <em>I&rsquo;m Wide Awake, It&rsquo;s Morning</em>. The vocal delivery is instantly recognisable, the lyrical smarts are present and correct, the rousing choruses are in place and we&rsquo;re all set for another super-enjoyable Bright Eyes record. I enjoyed walking around listening to this one, humming parts of it, singing others. It feels expansive (and not just because of the liberally used echoey production), assured and unafraid to be positive. &lsquo;Shell Games&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jejune Stars&rsquo; may be two of my favourite songs from the Omaha lot.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-beastie-boys--hot-sauce-committee-pt-2">5. The Beastie Boys — <em>Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2</em></h3>
<p>It was on, it was off, it changed its title, re-arranged its tracklist (and then rearranged it back)… but it was worth waiting for. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that <em>To The 5 Boroughs</em> is seven years old (and <em>Hello Nasty</em> 13!), and putting the kind of forgettable instrumental album from &lsquo;07 aside this is the first we&rsquo;ve heard from the Boys in all that time. The fact that any doubts are set aside within literally the first 11 seconds of the album came as a huge relief, and from there on in it&rsquo;s just a masterclass in goofy wordplay, infectious beats, and raps about food. Sometimes a quick flick through <em>Spin</em> or <em>Pitchfork</em> has me feeling that musicians right now are far too concerned with how they dress, and their &lsquo;image&rsquo; in general - fine, but it seems to impact the music, and make for a lot of self-serious, super-credible albums that lack a sense of fun. The Beasties have been the answer to that for a while, and whether it&rsquo;s the hardcore-esque &lsquo;Lee Majors Come Again&rsquo;, the slow groove of &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s A Little Something For Ya&rsquo;, or the built-for-a-ghetto-blaster &lsquo;Make Some Noise&rsquo;… no one else does it quite like them. There&rsquo;s another album full of this stuff in the locker, and you&rsquo;ll be seeing it on this list next year.</p>
<h3 id="4-radiohead--the-king-of-limbs--tkol-rmx-12345678">4. Radiohead — <em>The King of Limbs</em> (&amp; <em>TKOL RMX 1234567(8)</em>)</h3>
<p>Long awaited and yet unexpected, this was another surprise release strategy from Radiohead which brought us an album that felt instantly familiar and yet no less impressive for it. Around the album&rsquo;s release I read a bunch of comparisons to <em>The Eraser</em>, and that feels apt, though <em>TKOL</em> feels warmer, a little less downcast. The album has some serious swing to it (e.g. &lsquo;Little by Little&rsquo;), and moments of real beauty (e.g. &lsquo;Lotus Flower&rsquo;) - this feels like a band harnessing the power of <em>Kid A</em> / <em>Amnesiac</em> for good, a project they arguably started with <em>In Rainbows</em> but which is in full bloom now (pun intended).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cheating here a little bit by including the set of 8 remix EPs that were released throughout the summer and autumn. I was constantly impressed with what other artists brought out of the tracks from <em>TKOL</em>, whether it was turning &lsquo;Give Up The Ghost&rsquo; into a trance floor-filler or making &lsquo;Bloom&rsquo; sound like it was going to kick your teeth in, it made me see the Radiohead album in a bunch of new lights and really enhanced my enjoyment of it. I probably listened to the remixes more than the original in the latter half of the year.</p>
<h3 id="3-feist--metals">3. Feist — <em>Metals</em></h3>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this. I enjoyed <em>The Reminder</em>, though I came to it too late to get caught up in its spell of omnipresence in 2007. Perhaps as a result Feist has taken a back seat in my mind to Chan Marshall and Regina Spektor; it was immediately clear from my first listen to this album that that wasn&rsquo;t fair. <em>Metals</em> is a gentle, measured record filled with sunlight and beauty - it&rsquo;s truly a joyful listening experience. Both the instrumentation and production are warm and inviting; Feist&rsquo;s voice is capable of impressive range and has a great inner strength to it which carries these songs skipping along irresistibly. &lsquo;A Commotion&rsquo; is quite brilliantly agitated, and &lsquo;The Circle Married the Line&rsquo; is surpassing beautiful, and they are but two highlights on a flawless document of incredible talent.</p>
<h3 id="2-björk--biophilia">2. Björk — <em>Biophilia</em></h3>
<p>Nothing I could say about this album could make it appeal to you if you&rsquo;re not already interested in Björk&rsquo;s continuing project to find new forms of musical expression. I could use terms like gravity harp, Tesla-coil organ, and MIDI-controlled gamelan–celesta hybrid… but you&rsquo;re unlikely to care if you didn&rsquo;t already find Björk fascinating. This album, a concept record dealing with life&rsquo;s place in the universe, is perhaps less accessible than 2007&rsquo;s dancier <em>Volta</em>, and is certainly full of music that would rightly be considered difficult. I can only say that I&rsquo;ve had some of the best listening experiences of my year with this album and I find it endlessly fascinating, stunningly ambitious, and as close to genius as music came in 2011.</p>
<h3 id="1-le-butcherettes--sin-sin-sin">1. Le Butcherettes — <em>Sin Sin Sin</em></h3>
<p>This came out of nowhere, a mention post-SXSW that Omar Rodriguez Lopez had signed the first band to his new label, produced the record, and played bass on it. That was enough to ensure that I put it on my mental list, and when I finally caught up with it my socks were well and truly blown off. There are similarities to Distillers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and maybe even a touch of SoaD in there too - but in truth <em>Sin, Sin, Sin</em> sounds entirely of itself. The sound of a passionate bunch of people making music with heart is impossible to fake, and in his production of this album Rodriguez Lopez has been sensible enough to capture it whole and not mess with it. Pretty much every time I put this on I had to listen through it; there&rsquo;s not a weak track amongst the feisty bunch.
So, 39 minutes of ridiculously catchy hooks, twisted-genius lyrics, and volcanic levels of energy… there&rsquo;s your album of the year.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At some point in 1994 a friend returned from a European holiday bearing a gift: a C90 tape onto which he had copied a pair of albums that he&rsquo;d somehow discovered on the continent and thought I should hear. The way I like to remember it is with that hand-labelled tape being handed over along with the promise that the contents would change my life; if that actually happened then my friend was spot on. A couple of years prior to that I&rsquo;d driven my family to distraction on a European holiday of our own, with my insistence on the repeated play of a tape I&rsquo;d made with Michael Jackson&rsquo;s <em>Bad</em> on one side, and <em>Thriller</em> on the other. That was pretty indicative of my listening at the time: pop-rock and straight pop, my first self-purchased tape was The Spin Doctors' <em>Pocketful of Kryptonite</em>, and my first CD would soon be REM&rsquo;s <em>Monster</em>. I liked music - I was interested in it; I recorded the Top 40 on a Sunday, trying to cut out as much of the presenter&rsquo;s commentary as possible - but it wasn&rsquo;t a huge part of my life in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>That tape my friend handed me changed that. <em>Nevermind</em> on one side; <em>In Utero</em> on the other - it is the most magical piece of plastic I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>
<p>The argument has been made countless times that <em>Nevermind</em> is the most influential album of the last 20 years. I find that pretty convincing, but regardless of its impact on the music ecosystem as a whole it is undoubtedly at the centre of my own musical universe. I can trace pretty much everything I listen to on a regular basis back to it, even if it&rsquo;s by relatively extended degrees of separation. In the first instance Nirvana led me to Pixies, Black Flag, and Pearl Jam among others, which in turn led me to Fugazi, Smashing Pumpkins, Screaming Trees and countless other bands. The diagram, if I set my mind to drawing it, would be colossal, and <em>Nevermind</em> would be right there in the middle.</p>
<p>I remember Cobain&rsquo;s voice took some time to get used to. If you take into account the records that had occupied my Walkman up to that point it becomes obvious that he wasn&rsquo;t playing by the same rules as the singers in those bands. His delivery is raw, un-self-conscious and powerfully emotive, and though it didn&rsquo;t fit with my idea of &ldquo;good&rdquo; singing at the time, I was drawn magnetically to something about it. And the same went for other aspects of the album: the (relative) grittiness of the production (exhibited to a far greater degree on the other side of the tape); the huge drum sound; the ringing, shrieking distortion that somehow managed to remain tuneful&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Nevermind</em> put me under its spell quickly. I fell in love with it not by increments but in one swoop, and deeply. Infatuated with every note of it I began digging around for more: <em>Bleach</em> of course, and <em>Incesticide</em> I found pretty quickly; the same friend who had brought the enchanted object into my life was able to supply me with bootlegged concert tapes and recorded interviews. I had quite the haul of these holy trinkets before I found out that they were all I&rsquo;d ever have - that the man behind the distortion and that voice had taken his own life.</p>
<p>Kurt Cobain&rsquo;s suicide has its place as one of the founding legends of my youth, just as it does for many of my generation, and just as Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination had for our parents'. At times I embraced it morbidly, explored the shadowy depths of its martyr symbolism and wallowing in its beautiful, unimpeachable sadness. I see that now as a natural part of coming to terms with the concept of death - something which forms a part of adolesence equal in both importance and messiness to the period&rsquo;s bodily changes. It is impossible to calculate to what extent the tragedy of that death, and the extent to which its legend has been canonised, has coloured the legacy of the music. <em>Nevermind</em>&rsquo;s massive popularity is often spoken of as being some curious mix of owing to and having caused its author&rsquo;s suicide.</p>
<p>It only takes the simple act of listening to it, even 20 years after its release, to render the conversation meaningless. None of its magic has been depleted, and it still holds firmly that quixotic middle ground between belonging to its era and being truly timeless. <em>Nevermind</em>’s cultural impact is colossal, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be forgotten that it is comprised of millions of tiny revolutions the album has inspired in countless hearts the world over in the last two decades.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2011/08/16/donkey-wayside-mortuary.html">Donkey Wayside Mortuary — An Interview with Ofelia Hunt</a></h1>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ofelia Hunt is the author of the novel <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em>, recently published by Magic Helicopter Press, as well as several poems and short stories scattered around the internet. The following interview was conducted via a series of emails.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Adam Wood</strong>: For the most part I’m going to pretend I didn’t see the copyright page in the front of the book, though I kind of had to look after that line on your blog that says ‘Ofelia Hunt may not be 100% real.’ Is that the first thing everybody asks? Do you think people get too hung up on the pseudonym thing?</p>
<p><strong>Ofelia Hunt</strong>: I don’t know. The name Ofelia Hunt sounds (to me) like a fake name (it was based originally on an old Police drama, <em>Hunter</em>—I had recurring thoughts of the show, was wondering how it had disappeared). I do fear somebody will get pissed at me and start shouting, like, ‘authenticity’ and try to slap me with an oar or throw kittens, at a reading, perhaps. I could have a depressive breakdown at the microphone, and begin sobbing about alcoholism and the patriarchy.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: This is your first novel, but you’ve published a bunch of poetry and some short stories with Bear Parade before now. Did you find it different writing a novel, and how did the decision to do that come about?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I hate when people say something ‘occurred organically’, or whatever. So I’ll say this: I’ve always wanted to write novels. I’ve written three and half other novel/novella type things that weren’t very good or which lost their energy part way through. I felt like the stories in Bear Parade were a great way to prepare for a novel. In my head, the stories and the novel all have the same narrator. She may have different names or live in different places, but she’s the same person. Her style of narration evolved, in terms of sentence structure, paragraphing, etc… as I edited <em>T&amp;T</em>. But I feel like <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> could be read in conjunction. Or as a footnote or something. To some degree, the poems I wrote around that time are the same character as well. I’ve read that some writers map out, outline, or even write out character histories. I don’t, but the short stories and poems formed a sort of foundation for <em>T&amp;T</em>.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve read in interviews that you wrote most of the short stories that make up <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> in one sitting. How did you approach writing when it came to the novel: a chapter at a time?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: All the stories in <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> are maybe 300-900 words long. This is about the maximum I can write in one sitting, while still having time to edit and come up with something I will like (at least in the moment).</p>
<p>For the first draft I wrote straight through, chapter by chapter. I had this conception there would be two parts of twelve chapters, for twenty-four total, maybe representing an hour for each chapter, but only loosely. I wrote every day, about 500 words a day. I edited everything I had written before writing the next 500 words until this began to take too long, then I edited only the previous day’s work before writing new words. I also edited while writing. And then edited straight through several times. According to my Word document properties dialog box, the final version I have was revised 159 times with a total revision time of 65,230 minutes. I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: Your characters–and especially your narrator–seem to latch onto thoughts or words or sounds, and those things come up again and again. Does that come from an interest in how language works, or how certain people think? What’s behind that?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m very interested in how language works, how people work, how people work with language. Sometimes I imagine words on a tape (think 1950s computer technology) being fed into a person, by way of ear or mouth, in a sort of programming, and wonder what happens to the people after that. In a way, this is how I interact with people. Constant testing. I have difficulty communicating with other humans, especially when I first meet someone. It’s like I have to test, test, test, and find a new method each time. And in my head I often hear recurring words or phrases. I’m prone to repeating them over and over, as though the phrase itself is a joke. For example: “dollar dollar bills.” I used to walk up to friends I knew and repeat these phrases aloud and then walk away. I woke up this morning thinking, “donkey wayside mortuary.” Perhaps this is garbage language. Maybe I’m interested in garbage language. Where it comes from, where it goes.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I think there’s certainly a heavy reliance on ‘naturalism’ in popular literature, and that comes at the expense of exploring other ideas of how people actually think and speak. Dialogue (internal and otherwise) like yours strikes the ear as authentic precisely because it contains all of these little loops and flaws.</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yeah, realism/naturalism seem very concerned with creating a digestible whole, where each image/dialog/thought fits together all puzzle-like and calculated. Like a little machine you wind up and ride to epiphany. I feel ashamed to have typed that, a little, as I generally avoid similes. But maybe language, or garbage language can work machine-like also, or like dozens of machines, crawling from little round mouths.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: There’s a moment in the novel when the narrator says “I push piano-keys in a rhythmic way but with no regard for sound or beauty” (p.52). That kind of unlocked the novel for me, I think. There’s all this repetition and the writing pulls the reader along really powerfully, but without regard for traditional plot or narrative arcs. Would you say you’re more interested in how it ‘feels’ to read your writing as opposed to what it ‘means’?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yes. The idea that a ‘text’ could be easily interpreted into ‘meaning’ has always bothered me. Traditional narrative arcs are very predictable. By way of television, schooling, ‘genre’ (whatever that means), news media, we (or at least I) are/was indoctrinated into this very basic structure. I feel infuriated when a news report takes a very complex issue and turns into a digestible narrative arc: the US economy has slowed because of X or Y. Now we can ‘like’ it or not. Now we know who to blame. I hate the feeling of knowing what will happen next. I want to be surprised at every moment.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: That’s increasingly true of every sphere of life, I think: that binary reductivism. Do you think it’s your wish to be surprised that leads you to reject traditional plotting?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I think that’s part of it. Traditional plotting also involves a lot of planning. A lot of reshaping the text to fit the constraint of the narrative arc. I’m not interested in it enough to do it well. I’m more interested in writing sentences that sound how I think sentences should sound (at least mine), and assembling those sentences together in a way that pleases me. This leads me towards surprise (a lot of humor for me is surprise) and perhaps emotion.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve been describing the novel to people as kind of Kmart realism but with particular tendencies towards violence. Does that seem fair? How do you think of the book if you think of it in those terms at all?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: When I was small, my parents took me to Kmart to buy shoes. I don’t think in those terms, but I do admire the ‘Kmart Realists’. Anne Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, Joy Williams, Raymond Carver. Maybe Sartre can fall into this type of category in terms of stylistic representation of ‘reality’. Marguerite Duras? Robbe-Grillet? I know that in writing <em>T&amp;T</em>, I was very focused on attempting to represent how a mind works. I was reading a lot of Jean Rhys. I was thinking about the realism of Stephen Dixon’s writing. Stephen Dixon is probably the best I’ve read at representing a mind at work. Particularly in <em>Interstate</em>, which is a horrifically close third person. I wanted to write horrifically close first person. I want to experience ‘reality’ as an other.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: Have you read Nicholson Baker also? He’s very interested in the intimate details, but the language is less spontaneous, more studied, almost essayistic.</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I haven’t, though I just now read a little from <em>The Mezzanine</em> online. I like the singular focus on details, and the way they seem to swarm together, as though each little detail is more important than any character.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I read about this thing at Stanford called the Lit Lab, where they built a piece of software that analyses writing. They feed in all of these novels and plays and poems and this thing is slowly learning how to categorise literature on a purely empirical basis, instead of cognitively or emotionally, like a human might.</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I like that idea. I think <em>T&amp;T</em> might get categorized as a YA novel maybe, because of the fairly simple sentence structures, and maybe elementary school level word choice.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: You know Pirooz Kalayeh and Tao Lin, right? Are you involved at all with the film they’re making of Tao’s novella <em>Shoplifting from American Apparel</em>?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m not involved with that, but I am excited to see the film. And also to see <em>The Human War</em>, another Pirooz Kalayeh film based on the novel by Noah Cicero.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: Seems like <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em> would be almost impossible to film because so much of it is internal to the narrator’s experience. It would make a great audiobook though; is there a Hollywood actress you would like to record an audiobook version?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I agree. Any film of <em>T&amp;T</em> would probably be doomed by its lack of plotting. Not much happens that’s filmable and there’d have to be a ton of voiceover. I think the audiobook could be read very effectively by many actors: Frances McDormand (<em>Blood Simple</em>), Joan Chen (<em>Twin Peaks</em>), Scarlett Johansson (<em>Lost in Translation</em>), Felicia Pearson (<em>The Wire</em>).</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: What’s next for you? I assume you’re someone for whom writing is an almost daily part of life, regardless of whether you’ve got a ‘project’ in mind, but is there anything particular you’re working towards?</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m working on something that might be a novella, currently titled <em>Voltron</em> which might be about trailer parks. I’m also writing a series of short stories called <em>Horrorcore</em>. So far these have been stories written in about one hour that feature creepy imagery. Maybe they’re related to Horrorcore rap/hip hop.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: Ofelia, thanks for talking to me about all this.</p>
<p><strong>OH</strong>: Dude, thank you.</p>

			 <p>I was in an attic bedroom in Worcestershire when I found out Kurt Cobain was dead. I was sat in the computer room at college when I found out Soundgarden had broken up. And the day Rage Against the Machine split I was on campus at university. This evening, sat on a red couch in our living room, I just found out that we&rsquo;ve lost The White Stripes.</p>
<p>Unlike the first of those examples no one is dead, and unlike the third there&rsquo;s no apparent acrimony between members, but it still stings to lose a band you love. The relationship with music is intensely personal. For me it&rsquo;s interwoven with most activities of my day: I put a record on when I get up and shower, I listen to music whilst I&rsquo;m out walking or on the train, we play music in the car, whilst on the internet, whilst cooking&hellip; it&rsquo;s everywhere. And those bands you love become a part of your life in a way that perhaps only books and people can match. You feel a relationship with them as they accompany you about in the world, as you revise for an exam or wait in line at the bank, get up early for a long train journey, or drive to the coast on the weekend.</p>
<p>The White Stripes were special to me in one respect simply because they are bound up with so many memories. &lsquo;The Air Near My Fingers&rsquo; pretty much soundtracked the earliest parts of my relationship with Elizabeth, and a signed copy of the same song&rsquo;s musical notation hangs on our wall. We saw the White Stripes five times in total, four of those in two pairs of back-to-back nights at Alexandra Palace, and we always dressed for the occasion. They were a phenomenal live band, one of the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>There have been a number of times over the last few years that I thought this day was coming. The fifth and final time we see The White Stripes was at the Wireless festival in June 2007. The sound was poor, Jack didn&rsquo;t look happy wrestling against it, and the set suffered. We had tickets to see them again in 2008 when the entire tour was cancelled and the band took a break - something didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p>
<p>I never fell in love with The Raconteurs or The Dead Weather. Despite two solid records from each, neither has caught fire for me the way that Jack&rsquo;s collaboration with Meg did. Something about their pairing seemed natural, almost psychic, somehow inevitable - and the fruits of it were unlike anything that I&rsquo;d heard when I discovered them in 2001.</p>
<p>I could fill a paragraph with the names of bands and musicians that The White Stripes have led me to over the last ten years, but suffice it to say that within my personal musical constellation they burned brightly and held a position of great influence. It saddens me to see them go, but the words of their parting statement are a balm of sorts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue, nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack are feeling fine and in good health. It is for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is comfort there, as well as an awareness of what will be going through fans' minds, and a reverence for the art that has always been central to their project.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the last part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White Stripes do not belong to Meg and Jack anymore. The White Stripes belong to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the sort of grand, generous, slightly-mischievous thing that readers of interviews with Jack White have grown accustomed to. So, if The White Stripes is now the inheritance of its many devoted fans, along with it comes the responsibility of its safe-keeping. Put on a black armband, burn a red candle, then get a white piece of paper and make something.<br>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2011/01/22/black-swan-dir.html">Black Swan dir. Darren Aronofsky (2010)</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When I left the dingy Odeon cinema in Reading after seeing <em>Fight Club</em> in 1999, I felt elated. The movie had surprised and thrilled me, done things I&rsquo;d never seen on the screen before, and knocked me back in my seat with its last 20 minutes. Fincher&rsquo;s film was brave and brash and masculine, and — like Palahniuk&rsquo;s book — it challenged some assumptions about what it meant to be a man in the modern world. The psychoses resulting from the protagonist&rsquo;s breakdown fuel the movie, and really give you a picture of a person&rsquo;s mental state, as well as his time and place. Leaving the beautiful Curzon in Soho yesterday, having just watched <em>Black Swan</em>, I was struck by the similarities to <em>Fight Club</em>, and the extent to which Aronofsky has made a really wonderful, feminine counterpart to that film.</p>
<p>Like the earlier story, this one is driven by psychosis stemming from the protagonist&rsquo;s neuroses. Nina Sayers is beset by all kinds of questions about her femininity: she has multiple body issues which are both shown in the film and hinted at in her past; her relationship with her mother is mutually overdependent to increasingly uncomfortable levels; her sexual repression inhibits her both emotionally and as a dancer. Just as <em>Fight Club</em>&rsquo;s narrator struggles to adjust to a world in which what is expected of men has become unclear, Nina finds herself unsure in her roles as ingénue, seductress, daughter, and modern woman.</p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em>&rsquo;s script is brilliantly crafted to give Nina any number of models to measure herself against. Her mother was a dancer, and now has (too) high expectations of her; the fate of Winona Ryder&rsquo;s character — who precedes Nina as the ballet company&rsquo;s lead soloist — serves as an object lesson; Mila Kunis&rsquo;s new girl to the class seems to be Nina&rsquo;s shadowy opposite&hellip; and then there&rsquo;s Nina herself. In almost every scene of <em>Black Swan</em> we are presented with multiple Ninas, as Aronofsky&rsquo;s camera seeks out each mirror in every room. Rarely do we see Natalie Portman without <em>also</em> seeing her doubled, moving differently, from some other angle. It&rsquo;s a variation on techniques employed in any number of horror movies, but it is still masterfully done here, and pushed to an extent throughout the film&rsquo;s running time that leaves the viewer dizzy, and a little unsure of what they&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Natalie Portman is all over this film. Appearing not just in every scene, but multiple times in most; her face also appears on other characters' bodies, in dreams, on posters&hellip;. The profusion of the character, as well as the physical demands of the role, ask an incredible amount. In many respects — though some of the dance scenes show her graceful and athletic — the role of Nina Sayers is an unflattering one, which could only have been accomplished this convincingly by a mere handful of actresses. Though her lack of height gives her away somewhat amongst the other dancers, Portman&rsquo;s physicality and dedication to the demands of the part make for a remarkable performance which richly deserves the attention it has been receiving.</p>
<p>Aronofsky&rsquo;s direction is also to be applauded. Though it retains some of the handheld sensibility he developed to great effect on <em>The Wrestler</em> (2008), there is a more directed feel to <em>Black Swan</em>. Whether it is the aforementioned use of mirror images, or the very deliberate (and effective) use of black and white throughout the costuming and sets, there is a lot more to the film&rsquo;s aesthetic world than was the case with its predecessor. Any given frame of <em>The Fountain</em> (2006) will serve as testament to the fact that this is a director with an eye for rich detail and composition, and like that film <em>Black Swan</em> feels like the product of a considered and masterfully orchestrated vision.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="20-ok-go--of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky">20. OK Go — <em>Of the Blue Colour of the Sky</em></h3>
<p>It’s a great feeling to be surprised by an album, and even more special when it happens more than once within the same record. Even having heard very little of the previous material I thought I had OK Go pegged: another spiky pop band in the Tapes n’ Tapes, Hot Hot Heat mould but with more innovative promo videos. It turns out there’s a lot more to the Chicago four-piece than that.</p>
<p>As those self-made videos attest, this is a band bursting at the seams with ideas, and on this album they let rip with a multitude of styles, delivering dance-rock (‘This Too Shall Pass’), ballads (‘Skyscrapers’) and synth-pop (‘End Love’) among others. The album highlight is a toss-up between the shockingly on-the-money Prince tribute ‘White Knuckles’ and the surprisingly tender digital lament ‘Before the Earth was Round’. In some respects it’s shocking that those two songs exist on the same album. That OK Go attempt so much here and pull it off without a misstep is deserving of enormously impressive.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="19-the-posies--blood--candy">19. The Posies — <em>Blood / Candy</em></h3>
<p>Along with Brad’s <em>Interiors</em> (1997) and Screaming Trees’ <em>Dust</em> (1996), I treasure The Posies’ 1993 album <em>Frosting on the Beater</em> for having shaped something special out of the beautiful, melodic aspects of grunge without having felt it necessary to pretend at angst. I dipped into some of the band’s other records but didn’t find anything as consistently engaging. Likewise with albums since; I listened to 2005’s <em>Every Kind of Light</em> a fair bit, but I honestly don’t remember whether it claimed a place on my year end List.</p>
<p>Having taken a bit of a break since then it seems that some of the old magic has been recaptured. <em>Blood / Candy</em> is a set of three and four-minute easygoing pop gems with just the right touch of melancholic edge to them. Opener ‘Plastic Paperbacks’ is expertly judged, and enough by itself to assure you that this is a band (having been recording since the late 80s) in full command of their talents. The subtle mood-swings of ‘Cleopatra Street’ are further proof that The Posies are capable of pretty much anything they turn their mind to, and the three and half minutes of ‘For The Ashes’ prove it, crafting something heartbreaking and huge-seeming out of very little.</p>
<h3 id="18-flying-lotus--cosmogramma">18. Flying Lotus — <em>Cosmogramma</em></h3>
<p>I remember seeing a lot of positive things written about the previous Flying Lotus album—2008’s Los Angeles—but for whatever reason I never got around to picking it up. When <em>Cosmogramma</em> dropped in early summer I was sure to get in on the ground floor, and I discovered an album of dense, vital electronica brimming with energy and ideas.</p>
<p>My touchstone for this genre remains Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet, and what Flying Lotus is doing here is a little messier and, I would guess, more aimed at the headphones than Kieran Hebden’s recent output, which has been more club-oriented.</p>
<p>The Thom Yorke cameo on ‘…And the World Laughs with You’ is an easy highlight, but in some ways (e.g. it features vocals) it’s an outlier. This is a really interesting, layered record that I returned to a lot when zoning out during commutes.</p>
<h3 id="17-four-tet--there-is-love-in-you">17. Four Tet — <em>There is Love in You</em></h3>
<p>My relationship with Four Tet is rooted in 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>, and it seems a long time since anything new has been released. That’s slightly misleading in that Kieran Hebden is a prolific remixer of everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Radiohead, and has, in the intervening five years, put out two EPs and two very strong albums of material with jazz drummer Steve Reid.</p>
<p>Still, it’s nice to have a new, full-length release from Four Tet. I’ve played the 2008 EP <em>Ringer</em> quite a bit, but somehow it felt like something of a stop-gap, and this album shows why. Hebden has been hosting nights at Shoreditch’s Plastic People for a while now, and has talked in several interviews about how the experience has affected his music. What separates this album from its predecessors is that it was built to be played to a live audience whereas the previous LPs fall into what I would categorise as headphone listening. That’s not to say that they wouldn’t work the other way round, but the shift is noticeable here on tracks like ‘Sing’ which loops and swings with a very singular purpose. I would guess that I’ll return to <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> more, but this is still wonderful stuff.</p>
<h3 id="16-loscil--endless-falls">16. Loscil — <em>Endless Falls</em></h3>
<p>This was a discovery via Bleep.com, which has been good to me over the last couple of years when it comes to electronic music. On the mental list of artists in this genre, which I keep arranged by pace and tone, Loscil sits towards the slower, calmer end of the spectrum and has served as perfect reading music, winding down music, and getting-started music in roughly equal measure.</p>
<p>The album’s cover photograph of blurry street furniture seen through a rain-splashed window sets the mood quite well. The album starts with what feels like almost a full minute of rain noise (which I’ve always been a sucker for anyway) and the pace doesn’t pick up a whole lot from there. It’s hard to put on paper what works so well about the music here. It develops at a glacial pace and all exists within the same tonal colour pallet of greys and blues, but this is expertly and subtly constructed stuff with genuine weight behind it.</p>
<p>Of the instrumental music I’ve played a lot this year <em>Endless Falls</em> has leant itself least to being used as background music. Something about its intricate shadows and textures insists upon attention and patience, which it rewards with great depth.</p>
<h3 id="15-she--him--volume-two">15. She &amp; Him — <em>Volume Two</em></h3>
<p>Having this album sat next to Loscil highlights the absurdity of drawing comparisons between much of this year’s listening material. All I can say is that I listened to Volume Two a lot and, despite its seeming simplicity, it didn’t even begin to get old.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most apt adjective for this album is “charming”. The record is immensely and instantly likeable, thanks in part to Deschanel’s voice—which resembles a slightly softer Jenny Lewis—and also to the quirky, poppy arrangements of many of the songs. Sometimes it sounds like 1950s bubblegum (‘Gonna Get Along Without You Now’ could be a Chordettes cover), sometimes like the Beach Boys (‘Don’t Look Back’), but regardless the quality never lets up and it’s impossible not to be swept up in its enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="14-joanna-newsom--have-one-on-me">14. Joanna Newsom — <em>Have One on Me</em></h3>
<p>Unique doesn’t begin to cover Joanna Newsom. Placing her in the folk category seems dismissive of her sound’s expansiveness and her penchant for theatricality. The lyrics are certainly folky in that they often convey stories woven out of pastoral themes, but (just as with Laura Marling) there’s a lot more going on here.</p>
<p>On 2006’s <em>Ys</em>, Newsom really embraced the drama of her songwriting, bringing in Van Dyke Parks to add flourishes and even more colour to her songs. Arguably this led to the album feeling a little too dense and claustrophobic, an impression not helped by its composition: five tracks with an average length somewhere north of 10 minutes.</p>
<p>By contrast, though it exhibits a markedly longer running time, <em>Have One On Me</em> seems less weighty, airier, possessed of more space and sunlight. Many songs are stripped back simply to Newsom’s voice and harp, which have always been the core of her art and have never been better than here. To a greater extent than any other record I listened to this year, Newsom’s album offers you a chance to put on headphones and drift away to a different place entirely. She remains quite unique.</p>
<h3 id="13-laura-marling--i-speak-because-i-can">13. Laura Marling — <em>I Speak Because I Can</em></h3>
<p>Laura Marling’s 2008 debut was that rare thing in the world of the modern music press: an unexpected delight; a surprise. That voice, the very English-ness of her sensibility, her ability to seem and sound simultaneous fragile and formidable. It was immediately clear that Marling was a prodigious talent and the purveyor of a quite unique sound, and that album was by far and away my favourite of the year.</p>
<p>Since then it seems that a number of acts have attempted to peddle a faux-folksy kitsch in Marling’s wake, and it has more often than not rang a little false to my ears. Marling’s sincerity is palpable and her ability to tell a story in each beautiful song is unparalleled among her peers. <em>I Speak Because I Can</em> is a more assured album, and a mesmerising one. The swinging melody of ‘Alpha Shallows’, the heart-wrenching beauty of ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’, the barefoot do-si-do of album closer ‘Nature of Dust’… everything here is masterfully accomplished and infused with limitless warmth and charm. If it falls short of its predecessor it is perhaps only because it comes as no surprise.</p>
<h3 id="12-olafur-arnalds--and-they-have-escaped-the-weight-of-darkness">12. Olafur Arnalds — <em>…And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness</em></h3>
<p>Arnalds is a 24 year-old Icelandic multi-instrumentalist making stunningly beautiful avant-garde orchestral electronica. This has been on rotation right alongside the Loscil album as perfect examples of simple music displaying almost limitless depths. Listened to on headphones it reveals itself to be utterly compelling and endlessly beautiful, as well as quite a draining listening experience. The way the simple melody of ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’ blossoms, for example is masterful, and the introduction of the cymbals at the three-minute mark is one of the most raw emotional moments I heard this year.</p>
<p>The album’s tone shares some similarities with Arnalds’ more famous countrymen Sigur Rós, and the fact that he has duplicated their sheer expansiveness of sound, and retained their balance of complexity and simplicity whilst playing and constructing everything himself is, frankly, astounding.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="11-christian-scott--yesterday-you-said-tomorrow">11. Christian Scott — <em>Yesterday You Said Tomorrow</em></h3>
<p>When I started getting into hip-hop in the late ‘90s, I started digging for those “important” and “classic” LPs from a jumping off point of Run DMC, Public Enemy and R.A.T.M.’s <em>Renegades</em>. But I didn’t feel properly engaged in the genre until I stumbled across a contemporary artist who blew my mind: Buck 65’s <em>Square</em> (2002) completely changed my thinking about hip-hop and made the music feel really alive to me.</p>
<p>So, when I started to get serious about jazz a few years back I tried from the outset to make it an equal part of my self-education in the genre to find contemporary artists. Jason Moran and Robert Glasper have both appeared on previous lists, but this year Christian Scott re-defined my ideas about what’s possible in jazz with this astounding record.</p>
<p>Listening back through Scott’s catalogue this isn’t a fluke: both 2006’s <em>Rewind That</em> and the following year’s <em>Anthem</em> are enormously assured and overflowing with brilliance. One listen to the latter’s opener ‘Litany Against Fear’ is all the evidence required for jazz’s contemporary vitality.</p>
<p><em>Yesterday…</em> however, is probably my favourite of the three, with album highlight, the achingly plaintive ‘Isadora’, standing as the most beautiful song I heard in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="10-keith-jarrett--charlie-haden--jasmine">10. Keith Jarrett &amp; Charlie Haden — <em>Jasmine</em></h3>
<p>Jarrett took 14th place on last year’s list with <em>Yesterdays</em>, a record I described at the time as “not my favourite Jarrett album”, and this year he takes 10th with absolutely my favourite of his recordings that I’ve heard.</p>
<p>Jarrett’s collaboration with bassist Charlie Haden stretches back to 1967 and now numbers eight albums. Listening to <em>Jasmine</em> it’s easy to see why the two keep returning to this partnership. Jarrett’s playful, light piano swims effortlessly atop the subtle thrum of Haden’s double-bass undertow, knowing exactly when to allow the latter time to rise to the surface momentarily. The connection (as I said last year of Omar &amp; Cedric) must be near psychic to produce something so effortlessly unified. It’s a joy to listen to and endlessly relaxing.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="9-deftones--diamond-eyes">9. Deftones — <em>Diamond Eyes</em></h3>
<p>It’s fifteen years since I fell under Deftones’ spell with the visceral post-punk thunder-dirge of <em>Adrenaline</em>, and a decade since they hit their peak with the heavenly <em>White Pony</em>, which remains on my list should I have to pack five albums for a desert island.</p>
<p>2005’s eponymous album, whilst still solid, felt a little lacking, but they really hit their stride again with 2006’s <em>Saturday Night Wrist</em>. And then the worst happened. During recording for what was to be a back-to-basics rock record titled <em>Eros</em>, bassist Chi Cheng was hit by a car. <em>Eros</em> was shelved indefinitely and it looked for a while like Deftones had come to an end.</p>
<p>Cheng remains in a coma, and with <em>Diamond Eyes</em> his bandmates set out explicitly to make an album that would honour him. And what a fantastic tribute they have paid. By turns angry, beautiful, contemplative and celebratory this is their finest album in ten years and sounds not unlike <em>White Pony</em> in terms of breadth of tone and dusky, humid production style. Deftones remain a singular band, devoid of genre, possessed of limitless talent and still capable of surprising me.</p>
<h3 id="8-broken-bells--broken-bells">8. Broken Bells — <em>Broken Bells</em></h3>
<p>I only really got into The Shins with 2007’s <em>Wincing the Night Away</em>, and it seems cruel to have made me wait so long for a follow-up to an album I enjoyed so much. With no sign of James Mercer getting back in the studio with the rest of his band, this will have to do for now, so it’s a good job it’s terrific.</p>
<p>Mercer has a very expressive voice, which, alongside his brilliant lyrics, is my favourite aspect of The Shins. It’s just as well served here by Danger Mouse’s beats, which are more melodic than some of his work (e.g. with Jemini, or arguably Gnarls Barkley); it’s perhaps closer to his production of the Sparklehorse albums and Beck’s <em>Modern Guilt</em> a couple of years ago. The lyrics and vocal performance remain the highlight for me, but the dreamy bedding of ‘Your Head is on Fire’ or the hazy synth strings of ‘Citizen’ are what hold this odd, lovable album together.</p>
<h3 id="7-vampire-weekend--contra">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Contra</em></h3>
<p>Where did Vampire Weekend come from? Who told them it was okay to make this twice-concentrated infectious indie-intellectual-pop with afro influences? After the 35 minutes of V.W.’s debut dominated my stereo almost exclusively for months, I remained unsure that a second album of the same kind of material would be as satisfying. What <em>Contra</em> proves is that this isn’t a gimmick, and that if you have it in you to produce more of this ultra-catchy pop music it should be mandatory that you do so.</p>
<p>Vampire Weekend are doing many of the same things here as they seemingly invented on their debut, but the trick isn’t worn out, it’s just as energising and refreshing as first time around. Absolutely devoid of cynicism and full to the brim with enthusiasm for life and music, this is another summer album that has proven to be great listening throughout the year.</p>
<h3 id="6-surfer-blood--astro-coast">6. Surfer Blood — <em>Astro Coast</em></h3>
<p>It can’t be easy being an indie buzz band. For all of the hype-fed blog hysteria, there is (just as inevitably) the backlash. The hipsters have this down so well now that, to the average observer, the two seem almost simultaneous, leaving one unsure whether it’s cool to like Surfer Blood this week or not.</p>
<p>But who cares when the music is this good? I’ll admit that, perhaps as a result of buying into some of that hype, the first time I heard <em>Astro Coast</em> I made unfriendly comparisons to Vampire Weekend. Unfriendly in that they were tainted with a pinch of copycat accusation, but the more I listened to the album the weaker that connection seemed, until I now almost can’t understand how I made it in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Astro Coast</em> is a killer mix of debut album Weezer and <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Beach Boys, with a little So-Cal punk stirred in there for good measure. The result is sunny and infectious, and if there is a Vampire Weekend comparison it’s perhaps in the music seeming completely familiar very quickly. These songs feel as though you always knew them, and any time you play them it’s summer.</p>
<h3 id="5-charlotte-gainsbourg--irm">5. Charlotte Gainsbourg — <em>I.R.M.</em></h3>
<p>I didn’t think much of Gainsbourg’s previous solo album, <em>5:55</em> (2006), but when I heard the single ‘Heaven Can Wait’ which preceded this album I knew I had to at least give the record a try. And it’s a revelation.</p>
<p>The only explanation I can find for the chasm of difference in quality between the two albums is that Gainsbourg, like a crystal, seemingly absorbs the characteristics of those around her. <em>5:55</em> had Jarvis Cocker and Air all over it, and not enjoying the work of either of those artists I was put off by its euro-poppy production and coy foppishness.</p>
<p><em>I.R.M.</em> is a different beast. It’s tonally a little darker and packed full of the kind of tunes that the first album was missing. Gainsbourg has a strong, melodic voice, and Beck (as producer here) knows just how to use it. In fact the album exhibits Beck’s influence in myriad interesting, non-obtrusive ways; so much so that it almost feels like a collaboration. It’s quirky and knowing and unafraid to explore itself, and as a result it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="4-robyn--body-talk">4. Robyn — <em>Body Talk</em></h3>
<p>Full disclosure: Whiz has been into Robyn for some time, and if it wasn’t for her I don’t know how long it would have taken me to overcome my impression of Robyn (based on very little evidence) as just another dance starlet with little else to offer.</p>
<p><em>Body Talk</em> was originally released as a set of three EPs throughout the year, but Robyn helped me out in terms of list-eligibility by collating them into a single release that stands as the most energetic and fun album to occupy my headphones all year. Full of colossal glowing synth, the kind of bass that pulls you in two directions at once and some deliciously funny and caustic lyricism, this is ridiculously catchy, grade-A, thoroughbred dance-pop.</p>
<p>In a sea of indie and rock albums that come freighted with issues of credibility and hipness it was a pleasure to have something that did its job unquestionably by making me dance whilst I vacuumed, sing whilst I walked, and smile each and every time it came on.</p>
<h3 id="3-buck-65--20-odd-years">3. Buck 65 — <em>20 Odd Years</em></h3>
<p>Much like Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em>, this was released as a series of four EPs throughout the year, but alas no collated album has been forthcoming. <em>20 Odd Years</em>, however, necessitates the bending of list eligibility rules as to omit it on the grounds that it was released in parts would be nothing short of a colossal tragedy (especially as a collected edition is forthcoming).</p>
<p>The project marks the 20th year of Buck’s hip-hop career, and its material is suitably eclectic, taking in Buck’s various guises as romantic, goofball, virtuoso etc. etc. There’s very little Buck can’t do and do well, and the mix of styles here is somewhat dizzying. Replete with multiple guest vocalists and DJs this is a riotous celebration of a unique talent, never less than absolutely riveting and almost dangerously entertaining – just like the man himself.</p>
<h3 id="2-my-chemical-romance--danger-days-the-true-lives-of-the-fabulous-killjoys">2. My Chemical Romance — <em>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</em></h3>
<p>It’s been a long, almost unbearable wait since 2006’s <em>The Black Parade</em>. Four years in which MCR have broken themselves down and built themselves back up again (less one member), taken off the black clothes and swapped them for the most colourful things they could find. And what of the music? <em>Danger Days</em> sounds very little like its predecessor. In places it resembles a neon-infused version of 2004’s <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em>; like that album the overarching concept has the protagonists on the run, and the music is infused with a dynamism arguably lacking from the majority of the more meditative <em>Black Parade</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key to the differences between the albums is in the music out of which they are grown. If <em>The Black Parade</em> was a distorted gothic version of Queen, the soil in which <em>Danger Days</em> is planted is pure Springsteen-esque Americana as seen through a caffeinated hurricane of comic book images, muscle cars, and toy laser guns.</p>
<p>Frank Iero has called the album “the soundtrack to raging against the death of the creative spark”, echoing Gerard Way’s concerns about what entering his 30s meant for his art. And this does sound like a band who feel as though they have something to prove. Unquestionably they succeed in doing so.</p>
<h3 id="1-arcade-fire--the-suburbs">1. Arcade Fire — <em>The Suburbs</em></h3>
<p>What’s the strongest run of three studio albums you can think of? <em>The Bends, OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em>? <em>Off the Wall, Thriller</em> and <em>Bad</em>? <em>Master of Puppets, …And Justice for All</em> and <em>Metallica</em>?</p>
<p>Which band / artist has the best set of three studio albums to <em>start</em> their career? Nirvana? Björk? Deftones? Bloc Party? Foo Fighters?</p>
<p>Arcade Fire are undoubtedly something special. In an era that has seen the decline of the physical format and where “shuffle” has become the predominant listening experience, they are a quintessential album band. They are forthright and outspoken in their political convictions; indefatigable in their touring schedule; meticulous in their standards of quality. In the 44 tracks that make up their three albums and one EP to date there is not one weak song.</p>
<p><em>The Suburbs</em> is a remarkable achievement in and of itself: a beautiful, thoughtful record of songs full of longing and loss, love and loneliness and a pursuit of meaning. Its influences—as with the band’s previous albums—come from the middle of the North American radio dial, and no band is able to make that music seem so shiningly vital as Arcade Fire do on track after track.</p>
<p>The most insightful commentary I’ve seen on the album reads it as part of a trilogy. The feeling of longing to leave home, which is present on <em>Funeral</em> (particularly the ‘Neighborhood’ tracks) is mirrored in the return here of an older and wiser narrative voice to the place of its youth. <em>Neon Bible</em>, which sits in the middle as the record of worldly experience is noticeably darker and more preoccupied with menacing themes. <em>The Suburbs</em> sounds more comfortable and reflective by comparison, but is just as emotionally wrought in its own way.</p>
<p>It’s a stunning collection of songs, somehow living up to the astronomical expectations with which I awaited it; it also stands as further confirmation that Arcade Fire are the most consistently inspired and inspiring band recording today. Thom, Jonny <em>et al</em>: the ball is in your court.<br>

<h3 id="appendices">Appendices</h3>
<p>Putting this thing together was harder this year than maybe any year I can remember. A lot of great music missed out on a coveted top 20 spot and it’s only right that I make room for a couple of honourable mentions:</p>
<p>First and foremost, Glassjaw have been drip-feeding new material through one at a time YouTube videos and digital downloads and it’s mindblowing – a full album must follow in 2011 for the sake of my sanity.</p>
<p>Liars’ <em>Sisterworld</em> should by all rights have made this list. Along with Battles, who sadly split with Tyondai Braxton this year; they’re one of the most consistently innovative bands on my radar.</p>
<p>Polar Bear’s <em>Peepers</em> was another contemporary jazz find that got quite a lot of play – super funky and very playful.</p>
<p><em>The Monitor</em> by Titus Andronicus missed out by virtue of being more admirable than enjoyable, but still certainly warrants a mention.</p>
<p>As does Wolf Parade who, in <em>Expo 86</em>, made perhaps their most accessible LP to date.</p>
<p>The return of Far was cause for much celebration by me, but in the end, despite having one of the year’s best opening tracks in ‘Deafening’, <em>At Night We Live</em> didn’t quite manage to live up to the expectation.</p>
<p>Pure Reason Revolution’s <em>Hammer &amp; Anvil</em> somehow failed to grab me, perhaps because it came out relatively late in the year, and the same can be said for Warpaint’s debut <em>The Fool</em> and The Mynabirds’ <em>What We Lose in the Fire we Gain in the Flood</em>, both of which I only recently discovered and have been playing a lot – these may sneak onto The List if the year was a month longer.</p>
<p>Even in the best of musical years there have to be a couple of disappointments and it feels worth noting a few here:</p>
<p>The continued decline of Weezer is a source of great dismay, thrown into even greater contrast by bands like Surfer Blood making the sort of music Weezer used to be capable of.</p>
<p>The M.I.A. record was a similar disappointment after much anticipation, and Jimmy Eat World turned in a pretty lackluster effort – outdone at their own game by The Posies.</p>
<p>There were a number of interesting release strategies this year. As well as Robyn and Buck 65 choosing multiple EPs over the album format, there was Ash releasing one song every two weeks (the standard was pretty high too), Girl Talk and Gorillaz giving music away, and Smashing Pumpkins putting out a song every now and again from what Mr. Corgan promises will be a 44 track collection!</p>
<p>Off the top of my head and resisting the urge to overthink, these are my songs of the year in no particular order:</p>
<p>• Robyn ‘Fembot’<br>
• My Chemical Romance ‘Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na)’<br>
• Far ‘Deafening’<br>
• Charlotte Gainsbourg ‘Heaven Can Wait’<br>
• Laura Marling ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’<br>
• Arcade Fire ‘City With No Children’<br>
• The Mynabirds ‘What We Gained in the Fire’<br>
• The Posies ‘For The Ashes’<br>
• Christian Scott ‘Isadora’<br>
• Deftones ‘Rocket Skates’<br>
• Ólafur Arnalds ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’</p>
<p>And looking forward to the new year the albums which immediately come to mind as my most anticipated are by Glassjaw, Cold War Kids, Radiohead, Silverchair, Metallica, The Decemberists, Foo Fighters (?), Laura Marling and Beastie Boys.</p>
<p>Bring on 2011.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2010/12/19/tron-legacy-dir.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-12-18 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Dec 18, 2010</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Sometime during the hype-storm that preceded the release of <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> in 2003, I saw a preview video in which one of the film&rsquo;s producers advised the potential audience to &ldquo;read your Kant&rdquo;. Though it was a faintly ridiculous thing to say, and came from a man I had a hard time believing cared what people read as long as they paid to see the movie, it was another example of how invested The Matrix franchise was in the idea of the philosophically rich blockbuster. (See also the inclusion on the DVDs of a commentary track dedicated entirely to discussing the philosophy behind the films.)</p>
<p>The extent to which, particularly with the second and third films of the trilogy, the Wachowskis succeeded in building a story that meets their goal is still debated, but the fact that the goal existed is irrefutable. The nature of reality; the relationship between creator and creation; the existence of free will&hellip; these considerations and more are interwoven into the Wachowskis' story at such a basic level that it&rsquo;s easy to believe that they provided the inspiration for telling the story.</p>
<p><em>Tron</em> (1982) however, came about because director Steven Lisberger was fascinated by <em>Pong</em>. It&rsquo;s a humble genesis, and the movie it produced, whilst still thoroughly entertaining, hasn&rsquo;t aged well. Viewing it now for the first time, without the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia, it must be difficult to understand why it is so beloved, and why it was hailed as such a revolutionary method of film-making. Reading accounts of the film&rsquo;s production (such as the one in the Nov / Dec 2010 issue of <em>Little White Lies</em>, or the excellent article in the January 2011 issue of <em>Empire</em>) I was reminded of nothing more than of those reports from the &lsquo;set&rsquo; of <em>Avatar</em>: all those effusive remarks about what the advent of a purely virtual shooting environment would mean for the future of cinema; how it was now possible to create something almost entirely in post-production.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> is a romp. Its pace is surprisingly slow, but not because the characters stop to ponder the philosophical meaning behind their circumstances, just because that&rsquo;s the pace of a family adventure story shot in the &rsquo;80s without the crutch of C.G. to up its whizzbang quota. Joseph Kosinski&rsquo;s sequel is a different story. Wasting no time in getting his protagonist zapped out of the physical world and into the virtual one, the pace rarely lets up once Sam Flynn is neon-suited and thrown straight out onto the game grid having been told merely to &ldquo;survive&rdquo;. From here it&rsquo;s virtually all chase and pursuit, with a few martial arts brawls, lightcycle battles, and dogfights thrown in to keep the Daft Punk soundtrack busy.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of pauses, and it&rsquo;s in the pauses that <em>Tron: Legacy</em> really gets interesting. The film complicates the hero / villain dynamic by having both characters played by one man, albeit two versions of one man at two different ages. And despite all of the attention (deservedly) being paid to the technical process which allows the younger Jeff Bridges to appear in the film, it is the fact of the characters' homogeneity within the story that is more interesting. Clu, though his actions are villainous, is in fact motivated purely by his creator&rsquo;s original instruction: to make &ldquo;a perfect system&rdquo;. To do so he instills order at any cost and eradicates imperfection wherever he finds it. His creator, having been trapped within Clu&rsquo;s dystopian creation for centuries, has spent his time meditating, reading, and seeking to cultivate within himself and his pupil Quorra, a selfless acceptance, tranquility, and stillness.</p>
<p>One particularly telling line comes when Sam remarks to his father that the Grid must have been beautiful before Clu ruined it, and the older Flynn replies that &ldquo;Clu is me; I ruined it&rdquo;. Kevin Flynn is a wiser man than Clu precisely because he is a wiser man than when he made Clu in his own image. <em>Tron: Legacy</em> is a story about a man maturing, and learning to accept that his idea of perfection was flawed. Clu, as the unbounded version of Flynn&rsquo;s younger self, presides over a nightmarish dictatorship of virtual clones. The older Flynn has learned that the world is far wider than his experience, and that his concept of perfection is — ironically — flawed. He has learned humility, and shows himself to be capable of great personal sacrifice.</p>
<p>The film is far from perfect. It has some pacing problems, and Michael Sheen&rsquo;s turn as a strange Ziggy Stardust-inflected version of The Merovingian leaves a lot to be desired. But in amongst the impressive action and razor sharp environments, Kosinski does an admirable job of leaving the viewer with some of those questions the Wachowskis sought to prompt a decade ago.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Power">Dr. Nina Power&rsquo;s</a> book <em>One Dimensional Woman</em>. As well as being an insightful critique of contemporary feminism it has introduced me to an entertaining (if depressing) game to play when watching movies. The Bechdel Test originates from a 1985 instalment of a cartoon strip by Alison Bechdel called <em><a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/">Dykes to Watch Out For</a></em>. The test is simple: to pass, a film must meet only three criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two women in the film;</li>
<li>Who talk to each other;</li>
<li>About something other than men.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Power points to an extension of the third criterion, suggested by <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels-law.html">Charles Stross</a> in 2008: that as well as &lsquo;men&rsquo; we might include &lsquo;marriage&rsquo; and &lsquo;babies&rsquo;. Doing so, Stross argues, cuts down the number of films which pass the test by as much as 50%. It seems like a necessary if bleak addition to the test.</p>
<p>Another small alteration to the first criterion is pointed out in an <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20408121,00.html"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em> article</a> from August 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A later (and shrewd) variation added a particularly brutal requirement to question No. 1: Do the two women have names? &hellip; Names are things like ‘Annie Hall' and &lsquo;Erin Brockovich&rsquo; and &lsquo;Scarlett O&rsquo;Hara.&rsquo; Things that are not names include, to cite some credits from this year&rsquo;s movies, &lsquo;Female Junkie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s Secretary,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Topless Party Girl.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this seems like such a vital thing to expect that we can add it to the test without debate.</p>
<p>Applying the test in this way, as you may have guessed, results in a horrifically low pass rate, especially (but not exclusively) for mainstream Hollywood film. At <a href="http://www.bechdeltest.com">bechdeltest.com</a> users are invited to apply the test to films and report their findings. The catalogue of results doesn&rsquo;t make for pleasant reading. Just looking at some of the biggest films of 2010 we find that <em>Green Zone</em>, <em>Hot Tub Time Machine</em>, <em>Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Kick-Ass</em>, <em>Knight &amp; Day</em>, <em>Let Me In</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Shutter Island</em>, and <em>The Social Network</em> all fail to meet the criteria.</p>
<p>What is perhaps most concerning is that there is an element of self-fulfilling prophecy in the thinking behind Hollywood film production. As screenwriter Jennifer Kesler reported in a <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/why-film-schools-teach-screenwriters-not-to-pass-the-bechdel-test/">2008 blog post</a>, film schools are actively teaching screenwriters to fail the Bechdel test, and studio executives argue that audiences don&rsquo;t want to see &ldquo;a bunch of women talking about whatever it is women talk about&rdquo;. Arguments to the contrary are refuted by pointing at the box office takings for some of the movies mentioned above.</p>
<p>No one would argue that passing the Bechdel test is an absolute prerequisite for a good film (Citizen Kane does not meet the criteria for instance). But under the law of averages, as an indicator of the level of sexism in the modern output of the film industry, the results are truly shocking.</p>

			 <p>I remember, at the time of the original PlayStation’s release in 1994, attempting to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of all of the machines that were coming to market in what uses to be called the &ldquo;hardware cycle&rdquo;. Alongside Sony’s machine other contenders included the Philips’ CD-i, and the 3DO, in addition to entries from manufacturers more firmly established in the games business: Nintendo’s N64 (still a few years away and known at the time by a series of enigmatic codenames), and Sega’s Saturn.</p>
<p>Of those named above only the N64 retained the use of cartridges as storage for its games. All of the other machines represented console gaming’s first steps into optical disc media – a choice that impacted the design of the machines in some interesting ways.</p>
<p>Looking back now from the age of pocket-sized HD touch screens, the original PlayStation’s flimsy flip-top lid seems cheap and inelegant. At the time the very prospect of popping its little catch to insert one of the system’s black CD-ROMs was a tactile thrill from the first time you saw the machine pictured in a magazine. The design of the system was built entirely around the disc-housing at its centre. Fairly basic, not showy, and a terrible shade of dishwater grey inherited from Nintendo’s SNES, the unit was nevertheless desirable and the object of much attention right from its inception. Despite its rather boxy design, Sony had created a machine, the brand design of which was to become almost synonymous with videogames, until the arrival of Nintendo’s Wii in 2006 supplanted it in the mainstream consciousness.</p>
<p>I haven’t been a fan of some of Sony’s design choices with PlayStation. The first machine seemed utilitarian and charmless, but was improved greatly with a redesign in 2000 that reduced its size and rounded out its edges. Similarly the original PS2, whilst highly desirable and impressive at launch in terms of its processing power and capabilities, looked like a slab of concrete, or an eyesore of a skyscraper from which one may have fallen. Again a slim version four years later made for a much better looking machine. For the XBox 360, Microsoft employed San Francisco’s Astro Studios, who worked in collaboration with the Hers Experimental Design Laboratory (Osaka, Japan) to prove it was possible to make an elegantly designed system with a relatively large form factor (necessitated by the need for powerful processors and the fans required to cool them). Sony, again, fared less well: the PlayStation 3, whilst less industrial-looking than its predecessor in terms of design, adopted a gloss finish which made it a magnet for dust, and was hurt by a questionable decision regarding the typeface for its logo. For a third machine in a row it took the advent of the slim model in 2010 to correct some of these missteps.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/6f20fc7e65.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One element of the PlayStation brand which has remained constant, and which is undeniably amongst the most iconic pieces of brand design in the last 20 years is the controller, and in particular the four symbols that grace its face buttons. Whilst Nintendo has changed its joypads a lot between hardware (making a revolutionary controller the centrepiece of their latest machine), the PlayStation 3’s controller bears a striking resemblance to the original PlayStation’s. The joypad’s lead designer, Teiyu Goto, recently gave an interview to Famitsu magazine in which he discussed the process of designing the system and its controller. Particularly interesting are his comments on why he chose to forgo the normal lettering of face buttons in favour of symbols:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I gave each symbol a meaning and a color. The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper; I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively. People thought those colors were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those four symbols have become powerfully intertwined with the idea of videogames in a way which lettered buttons never could. It was a stroke of genius on Goto’s part to implement them, and they have understandably become the central aspect of the PlayStation brand. Perhaps with PlayStation 4 Sony will design a machine that matches their simplicity and elegance.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2010/09/05/tao-lin-richard.html">Tao Lin — Richard Yates (2010)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2010/09/05/tao-lin-richard.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-09-04 23:00:00 &#43;0000">Sep 4, 2010</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tao Lin’s new novel <em>Richard Yates</em> is by turns frustratingly literal, genuinely insightful, monotonous, charming, plain-faced and sweet. At a little over 200 pages it really only allows room for two characters: Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning (with the latter’s mother occasionally appearing at the periphery), and concerns itself equally with the minutiae of their days and the complexities of their relationship.</p>
<p>Appropriating the names of child actors is just one of many layers of non sequitur Lin employs, arguably starting with the novel’s title. Yates’ work is mentioned on occasion, and it is arguable that Lin is concerned here with some themes similar to those found in the late writer’s stories; just as likely however is that the title and character names, like the cover image, were chosen to exacerbate that feeling of disconnection from which Lin’s characters suffer and with which Lin’s readers are inculcated to empathise. The connections between things here are uncertain, the gravity of cause and effect feels loosened somehow so that the reader feels simultaneously as though floating, ungrounded in the world of Lin’s creation, and swept on by its rhythm and momentum.</p>
<p>The novel is not without plot, and indeed it is a great deal more concrete than the plots found in some of the author’s previous work. Stylistically <em>Richard Yates</em> bears more resemblance to Lin’s 2009 novella <em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em> than it does to his previous novel, <em>Eeeee Eee Eeee</em> (2007). In an interview with Brandon Tietz, Lin explains his effort towards a more “concrete / literal prose style” for <em>Richard Yates</em>. He gives examples of how a sentence might have appeared differently from one novel to the next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike got out of the car” in [<em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em>] would be “Mike left the car” in [<em>Richard Yates</em>] due to “got out” not being literal and being more words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a page from an earlier draft of the novel in which you can see Lin in the process of making these alterations. In the margin he notes that a sentence could be more economically conveyed as dialogue, or strikes through extraneous reportage and notes &ldquo;Boring&rdquo;. These slight differences fit with the overall trend away from magical surrealism in Lin’s work over the last couple of years, but <em>Richard Yates</em> still retains moments of Coen-esque unreality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My brother emailed me,” said Haley Joel Osment. “He wants to pay me money to live in Connecticut for two weeks to potty train his and his girlfriend’s French bulldog Babo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like much of the novel it would be wrong to read the above with what Lin would call a “neutral facial expression” and yet it’s couched within the context of quite a tense exchange, and is followed, five lines later, by a threat of suicide. Also in the aforementioned interview Lin says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My books that don’t have concretely surreal elements usually feel surreal to me in tone. Real life often seems “dreamlike” to me. I like viewing real life as a dream. I like writing about it as if it were a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lin’s detractors often criticise his one-note narrative style and his monotonous pacing, but these stylistic elements are also enormously challenging for the reader, who finds themself without the usual crutch of the author indicating to them how to feel. Lin’s style is artfully and meticulously constructed from elements of realism, minimalism, and reportage; seeming to give equal weight to wildly disparate narrative strands it asks the reader to assess relative importance for himself. This is made no easier by the fact that there are a number of fascinating dualities at the heart of Lin’s style: concrete v surrealist; surface detail v interiority; the specific v the vague. Whilst one might consider an economy of words to be one hallmark of Lin’s style, he is also fond of functionless detail, repetition and, in <em>Richard Yates</em>, unfailing use of the characters’ full names. Where he is generous with description it is most often on the level of volume rather than depth: details take precedence over insight, the reader again left to fend for themselves in parsing them. Which isn’t to say that there is objective, capital-M “Meaning” to be found. In a 2007 email to Gawker, Lin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though all meaning is arbitrary it can still be used as a tool just like arbitrary rules can be created to make life “better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels demonstrably true in Lin’s fiction. Nothing is given the weight one might expect an author to lend the “message” of his work – you might argue <em>Richard Yates</em> is a novel about loneliness, about discordance in relationships, about forms of communication and miscommunication, about any number of things. If you can resist the temptation to seek meaning however, there is enough enjoyment to be had in getting lost in the novel’s rich seam of detail and gathered up by the tempo of Lin’s prose.</p>
<p>In his ‘Ugly Fish Poem’ (from the 2008 collection <em>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</em>) Lin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i have wilfully and simultaneously subjected myself to multiple irreconcilable philosophies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that, by treating all things equally in terms of prose tone, Lin allows for the possibility that all things are of equal importance. It is an interesting exercise to approach his novel with this philosophy in mind, and to find that a catalog of petty shoplifting, instant messenger conversations and relationship strife is perfectly capable of subtlety, nuance and indirectly expressed depths of feeling.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Nicholson Baker is one of my favourite novelists: witty, observant and capable of conjuring magic out of any overlooked facet of life that he turns his attention to. Baker’s piece on videogames in this week’s <em>New Yorker</em> (abstracted <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/09/100809fa_fact_baker">here</a>) is characteristically insightful and treats the subject with a light touch, but reading it I felt the swell of defensiveness which rises in any hobbyist when their pastime comes under scrutiny by an outsider: Baker was missing the point. Baker’s report from the front line of gaming exposes the running themes of killing and dying in a manner which makes the gamer in me faintly ashamed. Judged like for like it’s hard to argue against the prevalence of death in gaming even over and above its centrality in cinema; even Sylvester Stallone’s back catalogue contains a body count which would appear meagre when put next to 90 accumulated hours of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> multiplayer. In large part I think this is due to an integral aspect of games with which no other media needs concern itself: challenge.</p>
<p>There is &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; music, there are difficult films, and there are certainly difficult books, but their difficulties are qualitatively different to that of games. When watching a film or reading a book the level of perceived difficulty is no barrier to continuation. The experience may seem less enjoyable or less rewarding, but you can still turn the pages, the DVD doesn’t start skipping if you lose track of the plot. Even in the case of solo play, games are a conversation happening in real time: a push and pull between the gamer and the game’s AI.</p>
<p>Gaming is, in large part, about challenge, and if you’re unable to meet the requirements for success you cannot continue. Baker notes the length of games, the 30+ hours put into making your way through an interactive narrative, and all of that time is accrued in overcoming obstacles. It just so happens that survival is a wonderfully clear-cut challenge, and character death the simplest way both to communicate to a player that their skills need work and to increase the game’s longevity. Thirty years since Atari’s <em>Asteroids</em> posed the challenge of keeping a little triangle in one piece by avoiding and destroying crude wire-frame rocks; thirty years also since players struggled to guide <em>Pac-Man</em> around mazes in search of power pellets, which would allow him to destroy ghosts before they could destroy him, game designers are yet to find a challenge as inspiring as avoiding death, or a thrill as basic as being the one to mete it out first. As the industry has grown and visual fidelity has increased exponentially the depiction of violence has undoubtedly grown more vivid and gratuitous, but death itself is part of some games for good reason.</p>
<p>Gaming of course, is a broad church. Uncountable games in a plethora of genres offer an experience entirely free of the obligation to kill or the fear of dying. Puzzle games, including the perennially popular <em>Tetris</em> (possibly gaming’s greatest success story to date) pose a challenge of an entirely different kind. Photo hunts, role playing games, management simulations (including wildly popular Facebook games like <em>Farmville</em>), sports simulations, platformers&hellip; all shift the balance away from the kill or be killed dynamic. And that is perhaps the shame of Baker’s piece; guided by his 16 year old son into playing only the biggest selling triple-A titles of the last year or so Baker has missed a great swathe of what games are capable of. It’s roughly analogous to watching <em>Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Twilight: Eclipse</em>, and considering that a representative sample of modern cinema. The shame is less that Baker falls into this trap — he is quite clear that his investigation is of his son’s gaming habits — but that it robs us of his thoughts on other games in which he might find more to like. An article in which Nicholson Baker plays through Jason Rohrer’s interactive memento mori <em>Passage</em>, or gets involved on either side of the story-telling game <em>Sleep Is Death</em> would be fascinating. Personally I would love to know Baker’s impression of Molleindustria’s <em>Every Day The Same Dream</em> or Amanita Design’s charming <em>Machinarium</em>.</p>
<p>All of this isn’t to decry Baker’s article. In it, and in the accompanying <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/out-loud/nicholson-baker-examines-video-games">podcast</a>, he is receptive to the idea of games as an art-form and is positively effusive about the beauty to be found in some of the constructed worlds with which he interacted. He praises the designers’ desire to “pay homage” to the real world - but that cannot be a game designer’s only goal, she must also busy herself with the effort to provide the player with an entertaining struggle. Part of loving an art form, and perhaps especially one still in its infancy, is wanting it to be viewed in a positive light. Baker does a wonderful job of appreciating detail in the games he played, but seems quick to write off their core as facile, trivial and blood-soaked. He may be right. In many ways gaming is going through an adolescence, with the first generation to have grown up playing games all of their lives now moving into positions of power within the industry. In time perhaps the predisposition towards violence will drop away and more nuanced stories can be told. Arguably this is beginning to happen already, and as it does hopefully more commentators of Baker’s calibre will discover that instead of merely base and bloodthirsty and brutal, games can be engaging and subtle and beautiful.</p>

			 <p>Looking down from Tate Modern’s first floor balcony you can see the scar left by Doris Salcedo’s 2007 exhibit <em>Shibboleth</em>, a lightning strike of new concrete which runs the length of the vast Turbine Hall. Perched up here you could happily spend a great deal of time watching people coming in from the rain and negotiating the hall’s gentle slope. Though currently empty the room still has the power to elicit a response. Children run and skip when they get through the doors, people are sat against walls eating their lunch, and here and there bodies are sprawled on the floor as people stare up at the steel-girder ceiling. This is part of what Tate Modern has brought to London in the ten years since it opened: an inviting public space in which to encounter visual art, and the idea that art-appreciation shouldn’t be solely the province of small, intimidating, elitist galleries. As one of 5 million visitors per year you are afforded both the chance to view some spectacular modern art, and the chance to observe other people doing the same.</p>
<p>The latest exhibition to take up residence on Tate Modern’s fourth floor, <em>Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance &amp; the Camera</em>, combines these ideas of art and people-watching, and challenges us to reconsider where the boundaries might lie. Over five thematic sections through more than a dozen rooms the visitor is presented with images which raise questions of intent, privacy, security and eroticism.</p>
<p>Entering the first room of the exhibition you’re met with enlargements of shots from Philip-Lorca diCorcia’s series <em>Heads</em>. The images were taken from a great distance when pedestrians in New York unwittingly tripped automatic lights diCorcia rigged on the sidewalk. The text accompanying the photos tells you that one of the artist’s subjects took legal action against him, with the court eventually ruling in diCorcia’s favour. By choosing to present this material first it feels like the exhibition’s curators are tipping their hand in the voyeurism vs art debate that plays out over the following rooms. In the rest of the ‘Unseen Photographer’ section we’re shown images taken through buttonhole cameras (neatly presented in circular frames) and one-way mirrors, and introduced to the technology of the ‘lateral viewfinder’, positioned at a right angle to the camera’s true lens to allow for surreptitious ‘sideways’ photography.</p>
<p>By sequencing ‘Celebrity &amp; the Public Gaze’ as the next section the visitor is asked to consider whether the rules are - or should be - different for the famous. The curators have performed a careful balancing act, leaving the question open for the visitor. On one wall there are several of Ron Galella’s photos of Jackie Kennedy, one (&lsquo;What makes Jackie Run&rsquo;) in which she is actively fleeing the photographer. On an adjoining wall Marilyn Monroe’s dress billows as she poses atop an air vent. The fact of the subjects’ celebrity brings a unique push and pull to the relationship between photographer and photographed and challenges us to separate public and private personae. The vibrant candid shot of Jack Nicholson which dominates one wall shows him swinging a golf club at the car of a driver who had just cut him up. There is a strange ‘in-character’ element to the image and it takes effort to see it as something other than a movie screenshot.</p>
<p>The next two sections are the exhibition’s most challenging, and form a duologue of two big themes: sex &amp; death. It’s not so much the explicit nature of the images within ‘Voyeurism &amp; Desire’ that sets you on edge, as much as the element of illicitness in their having been taken and now in their being displayed. I felt acutely aware of the people around me through these rooms, and watching others’ efforts to appear to be appreciating this art in an acceptable manner added an enjoyable meta-level to the exhibition’s central themes. This section also contained some of the most striking images, and two exceptional pieces of hanging: selections from Merry Alpern’s <em>Dirty Windows</em> series presented in four rows and three columns evoking a grid of windows in a tower block; and the frankly creepy shots from Kohei Yoshiyuki’s 1971 infrared series <em>The Park</em> individually illuminated by spotlights in a darkened corridor.</p>
<p>‘Witnessing Violence’ develops another human preoccupation in similarly captivating fashion. In amongst the obligatory stills from the Zapruder film Oliver Lutz has found a way to place the observer within the image. A large black canvas hangs alone on one wall, its image only revealed when the viewer looks at a monitor positioned nearby so as to frame them directly in front of the picture. The technique, which involves covering the photograph in infrared sensitive pigment is perhaps a little gimmicky but nevertheless impactful as another way of making the visitor reassess their relationship with the images on display.</p>
<p>The final section, &lsquo;Surveillance&rsquo;, is perhaps the weakest. The divide between viewer and subject is increased, the images are often of lesser resolution and there is a detectable lack of human engagement in their making. These are largely pictures taken automatically, or single frames from an automated recording; simply in terms of composition, colouration and focus you can tell that there is not a human interest overseeing their manufacture. As a result I felt detachment from these last photographs where the majority of what had preceded had engaged me.</p>
<p>Throughout the exhibition I sensed a lack of interest in narrative. The images on display were taken quickly or secretly or both, with the aim being to capture a single, true moment. The act of doing this removes that moment from its context and allows the viewer to wrap their own story around it. Every invasion of privacy with which we are confronted is simultaneously an invasion of our privacy and our invasion of someone else’s. Each image of violence invites us to imagine ourselves as victim, perpetrator and onlooker. In some cases, where a set of photos from the same series is presented, a story does begin to take shape - such as that in Enrique Metrinides’ &lsquo;Suicide Rescue from the Top of the Toreo Stadium&rsquo; - but even in these instances the narrative is abstract and incomplete. In this sense the exhibition demands every bit as much work on the part of the viewer as some of the ‘difficult’ abstract and impressionist work in the Tate’s permanent collection. For those interested in how the camera has changed our relationship to the world and each other, it is just as richly rewarding.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/ncroal">N’Gai Croal</a> is one of those smart guys that you just know you should listen to regardless of the topic at hand. He knows tech, he knows videogames, he knows basketball&hellip;. Occasionally though Croal will come out with something even more insightful than usual.</p>
<p>Before I cut back on my podcast consumption I used to listen to Croal in conversation every week on Out Of The Game; essentially the show is a group of friends, formerly or currently employed within or around the games industry, talking about anything that comes to their minds - though often it’s web or tech related. During one of the episodes Croal started talking about the file / folder structure of how we understand computing, how that design is predicated on an analogy of the computer as a desk, and how he thought the usefulness of that idea had expired. It seemed like the kind of idea that was underpinning a lot of the digital culture advancements and new technologies, but that I hadn’t actually seen spelled out anywhere.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time organising my digital content. Just as my bookshelves are alphabetised at home, I’m fastidious about making sure that everything’s correctly titled, labelled, tagged, and filed. I’m that guy you know who looks at your iPod and just shakes his head at how you have multiple artist entries for R.E.M., R.E.M and REM. I’m the one who makes little noises of disapproval because you have tracks just listed as ‘Track 1’, and some of your albums are missing artwork. Seriously, I’ll actually sigh if you’ve got solo artists alphabetised by forename just because you choose not to spend hours of your life completing the ‘Sort By’ field in iTunes.</p>
<p>I have a lot of rules for iTunes:</p>
<p>• Artist alphabetically by Surname, or band name disregarding ‘The’<br>
• Albums chronologically by release date (re-issues filed under release of original album)<br>
• Guest artists listed in square brackets within the song title, prefaced by ‘ft.’ (ie Song Title [ft. Guest Artist])<br>
• Square brackets for remix suffixes (ie Song Title [Mix Title])</p>
<p>&hellip;and on and on and on. These are rules I’ve developed over the course of years using the program to organise my digital music. Sometimes I’ll come up with a rule, or Apple will change the software to make something new possible, and I will have to spend <em>literally hours</em> making sure the change is applied uniformly to my entire library. It’s not easy being a pedant, but you do get a very clean-looking, easily navigable iPod out of it.</p>
<p>The problem is that not all systems are as flexible, and every system is different. Take Google for example; I tend to use a lot of Google applications in my every day life, Gmail and Google Docs chief amongst them. I like a clean inbox, and with Gmail’s huge amount of storage space and archiving function I can easily keep anything I’m not dealing with immediately, out of my way. Anything that’s dealt with I archive, anything that needs to be dealt with by me I keep in the inbox, and anything I’m waiting to hear back on I add a star to and archive. Then there are labels - the big difference between Gmail and its competitors (including Hotmail, from which I switched) was labelling emails instead of placing them in folders. I used to spend a lot of time on labels: wording and ordering them correctly; choosing colours that suit and making sure the colours were distinct enough from one another; making sure to apply at least one to emails I’d need again, but not too many as that felt like it defeated the object.</p>
<p>Now consider Google Docs, a super-useful way to move all my documents and files to the cloud and have them at my fingertips to edit anywhere. Docs was a revelation when it launched, but I quickly started to wonder why we were back to the language of ‘folders’ instead of ‘labels’, and the ‘Hide’ function was simply confusing at first. Docs is essentially using the same model as Gmail. ‘All Documents’ is an inbox, folders are essentially labels (in that you can store a single copy of a file in multiple folders), and ‘Hide’ performs the same function as ‘Archive’. What allows this model to work for email as well as documents, spreadsheets and various other kinds of files is Google’s powerful search functionality. Click ‘Show Search Options’ in the top bar of either Gmail or Docs and you’re presented with a remarkably similar box with various fields that will allow you to find any of your material.</p>
<p>This is the breaking down of the desktop analogy. The idea that N’Gai Croal spoke about is that when computers were first mass-produced they were based around a model that was familiar to their prospective purchasers: the desk. Each piece of data was a ‘file’ you could place within ‘folders’ and keep those in other ‘folders’ as you saw fit. This simple system allowed you to feel like you were in control of your data and find it again quickly when required. As the volume of data and the types of files grew (and it grew exponentially – <em>exploded</em> really) the model struggled to keep up. If you had photos, video, written documents and maybe even audio all related to one project, you suddenly had to decide whether to file content away by type or by context. You could duplicate the file of course, and store a copy in two places, but this caused two problems: firstly, it was easy to change one copy of a file and neglect to alter the rest, thereby fracturing your content; and secondly, doing so destroyed the idea of organising your content like material on a desk.</p>
<p>Google attacked the idea of multiple ‘copies’ of a document with Wave (wherein a single version of a document is collaborated on in real time) and with similar live-editing and collaboration functionality in their Docs suite. But to my mind it’s another of Google’s products that has finally rendered the desktop analogy next to useless: search itself. Those previously mentioned search boxes in Docs and Gmail allow me to find any file or email as long as I remember even the slightest detail about it, such as a word that it contains. Obviously the more I recall the better, as I can quickly make my search more specific: I can look for messages from a specific sender, containing a particular phrase and sent within a given time period, all with a few simple operator commands.</p>
<p>And the approach doesn’t only apply online. It bears pointing out that Microsoft’s Windows 7 has a greatly improved ‘Search’ function, which proves very good at pulling up all kinds of content very quickly with even the slightest of search strings. And it is perhaps telling that there is a ‘Search’ field built into pretty much every system window you open in the OS.</p>
<p>For someone as pedantic as myself it takes a lot to let go of the idea that I’m not better off meticulously labelling, filing, and sub-filing my content. But as hitting ‘Archive’ and learning to make better use of search becomes equally effective I find myself drawn more towards that way of working.</p>

			 <p>In the NME review of Arcade Fire’s upcoming third album <em>The Suburbs</em>, Emily Mackay writes that the record could be ‘their <em>Automatic For The People</em>’. When I read that sentence something like the dropping of a penny occurred in my head: why hadn’t I noticed similarities between those two bands before? In the ten years that I’ve been doing end-of-year album lists only Arcade Fire have been #1 twice. Both of their previous albums have been my favourite record of their respective years; the highest placing for an REM album in that time has been #18 for <em>Accelerate</em> in 2008. But the time was when the Athens band was one of my absolute favourites. At some point <em>Out of Time</em> (1991) and <em>Automatic for the People</em> (1992) became sacred artefacts amongst my group of music-loving friends - examples of the kind of intricate, layered pop albums no one was making anymore. I loved <em>Monster</em> (1994) too, but possibly that was influenced in some degree by it being the first album I owned on CD.</p>
<p>When <em>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</em> came out in 1996 it took a while to sink in, but I was finding new things to love with every listen, and in time it became one of my favourite REM records. To this day, though I now know it so well, I can still put it on and be floored by its inventiveness, its light and shade and its boldness in everything from instrumentation to song construction to production.</p>
<p>But back to Arcade Fire. When <em>Funeral</em> came out in 2004 I was stunned by it almost instantly. This was at a time when I was hungry for something new-sounding, and here was this odd Canadian septet with a record about community and place that was a little creepy and at the same time warm and welcoming&hellip; I was knocked out. That record came out in February and lasted the whole year to be my number one by some margin. <em>Neon Bible</em> (2007) took longer for me to fully appreciate. Arcade Fire were brave enough to broaden their scope somewhat on that album, and to paint with quite a different colour palate such that I had to go through a process of letting go some of the things I thought I knew about the band and approach them again with a clear slate.</p>
<p>They’ve always seemed such a unique band to me. There are plenty of groups with whom they share some qualities (eg. The Decemberists’ moody urban-pastoralism; Dirty Projectors’ choral feel etc.) but Arcade Fire have a quality I find almost undefinable: something familial, rooted and genuine - something like honesty. I’ve long felt a similar quality in Michael Stipe’s lyrics and in his voice, and in the enveloping, subtle music REM have been recording for almost 30 years. Only upon reading that remark in NME this morning however, did I discover a connection that immediately made so much sense. On the magazine’s cover Arcade Fire are referred to as the ‘saviours of rock’, which also feels about right; they seem to be of the correct temperament, and possessed of the boundless talent required for a long career. If their <em>Automatic for the People</em> is coming out next week, imagine what their <em>New Adventure in Hi-Fi</em> will sound like.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It is Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s birthday. When I think about my favourite directors the names that come to mind tend to be people with long and varied filmographies, and Van Sant&rsquo;s name is right near the top of that list. You look through his back catalogue and you can&rsquo;t help being impressed with the sheer volume of creative work he&rsquo;s produced, not to mention the quality of it.</p>
<p>I think I first became aware of Van Sant&rsquo;s name in relation to his 1998 remake of <em>Psycho</em>. I was a lover of the Hitchcock original and I went to see the film in the cinema. I remember through most of the movie being captivated by just how slavishly Van Sant had copied the decades-old classic and even though the film is far from his best work it marked him out to me as someone whose love of film shines through on screen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think at that time I was aware that it was Van Sant behind the camera for <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (1997); all of the conversation surrounding that film had been about Damon &amp; Afflek and I probably assumed that it was a studio director-for-hire who had been brought in to shoot it. There&rsquo;s no doubting the film is well made, but it&rsquo;s the script and the performances that are doing the heavy lifting; supporting evidence came a couple of years later when Van Sant essentially tried to make the same film again in the form of <em>Finding Forrester</em> (2000) with lesser results. These studio films pay the bills; they&rsquo;re cinematically pleasant enough and clearly put together by someone with good instincts, but Van Sant only really shines when he&rsquo;s free of their constraints.</p>
<p>Once the name was known to me I went back and watched some of the earlier work and it was clear that this was a director who didn&rsquo;t belong in the studio system. His camera likes to linger and wander, scenes play out un-rushed, characters mumble and shuffle, often Van Sant movies are not pretty but they are stylistically flawless. When <em>Elephant</em> (2003) came out it seemed to me to be a singular artistic statement which expressed in one stroke a whole swathe of pent-up, suppressed and otherwise inexpressible thoughts and feelings that had been bubbling under the western liberal psyche since those twin millennium-straddling events: the Columbine high school shootings of 1999 and the attacks on New York and Washington DC in September 2001. The subject matter of the film is obviously more closely modelled on the former, but as someone who was moving into adulthood at the time of those events I remember a distinct feeling of things slipping, getting worse, and a confusion that went with it. Somehow Van Sant got that on film; he captured something which other artists in all mediums were finding elusive. <em>Elephant</em> feels to me talismanic in some way, a coherent expression of something inexpressible, comparable to the relationship of Picasso&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guernica&rsquo; to the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>On a more personal level I had no particular desire to see the story of Kurt Cobain&rsquo;s suicide put up on screen, but Van Sant&rsquo;s 2005 film <em>Last Days</em> is touching, poignant, thoughtful and respectful in perfect measure. That lingering camera is the tool of a director who trusts his actors, and Van Sant&rsquo;s confidence provides the film with a measured pace that gives the viewer opportunity to reflect whilst watching. Some directors work their entire lives trying to make sure that thought is the last thing inspired in their audience when the movie is still rolling, it takes great confidence in one&rsquo;s abilities before one is willing to let the viewer have his own space within the film. Like <em>Elephant</em>, there is something crystalline-perfect in <em>Last Days</em>' exploration of loneliness and depression. Both films are perhaps difficult to watch in parts, but enormously rewarding.</p>
<p>Gus Van Sant is one of film&rsquo;s true auteurs, and yet he has been smart enough to make films that have added stability and longevity to his career. 2008&rsquo;s Oscar-winning <em>Milk</em> seems in some ways to be a perfect fusion of the two halves of Van Sant&rsquo;s back catalogue: a deeply personal film made with studio-backing and an eye on the awards season. That it succeeded on every level and in all senses of the word is completely deserved for such a fantastic film-maker.</p>

			 <p>In an age of infinite duplication, when what we mean by photography or film or music is (with increasing commonality) a digital file easily reproducible as an exact copy of itself, there is something revolutionary about the very idea of a unique artwork. Limited edition vinyl pressings and packed-in hardcover art books are one thing, but really they are just a means of seeming to rarefy something which can be bought far more cheaply in an unadorned form (or acquired without charge if you are of threadbare moral fibre). Playing entirely improvised pieces of free jazz, the Australian trio The Necks are offering something quite unique: the chance to hear genuinely new music which will not be heard again.</p>
<p>When the lights go down in The Barbican’s theatre they go all the way down: the audience is in complete darkness and only the three musicians are spotlit on stage. Chris Abrahams sits at the piano, hands between his knees, staring intently at no sheet music. Lloyd Swanton cradles his double bass with his eyes closed. Tony Buck sits at the drums without a stick in his hand.</p>
<p>It’s Abrahams that starts the first set, tentatively keying something out on the piano’s upper register. After a couple of cycles Swanton’s bass picks it up and my eyes move to Buck who begins minimally supporting the structure of the rhythm that is taking shape. At first the relative slightness of the music builds a tension in the room; almost everyone here must be aware that The Necks’ <em>modus operandi</em> is repetition and escalation, but there’s something delicate about what’s happening that makes the enterprise seem dangerous. Because this is music being born, being created before us, the idea lingers that it might not survive.</p>
<p>Buck seems to be the primary inventive force in the first set’s development. His percussive colouring is <em>nonpareil</em>: with his right hand he succeeds in producing at least a half-dozen unique tones by striking in various ways different parts of one cymbal; he operates a small set of wind-chime bells with his left hand and gradually builds something on the bass drum. After a while I am aware that the sound now has too many elements for me to hold in my mind at once. It has grown and evolved, still rhythmically consistent with its very first moments but an order of magnitude more complex. Some of The Necks' magic comes from this ability to lull you in the beginning into intense concentration on a small number of sparse musical elements, such that when the music intensifies you find yourself both invested in its skeleton and unable to simultaneously appreciate all of its parts. What results is a kind of semi-hypnotic state.</p>
<p>In the auditorium’s darkness and the performers’ situation in the spotlight there are parallels with Beckett’s <em>Not I</em>. In that play the rhythms of language are used to seduce and then overpower the ear and mind such that sat in the dark watching only an illuminated mouth on stage it is easy to become disorientated and mesmerised. Something similar is happening on stage as The Necks at once construct and are propelled by a wave of sound. The volume builds as the sound evolves, parts become more elaborate as if by mitosis. I shut my eyes at one point and experience this as something entirely different to any live music I have been audience to. There is an incantatory quality to what has arrived in the room: an organic musical structure, the vitality of which is no longer in doubt.</p>
<p>Speaking of the music in such a way has the effect of reducing the agency of the players. There should be no doubt of the level of musicianship on display, but The Necks’ genius is in removing themselves mentally from the process of the music’s creation. By being tremendously gifted at playing their instruments but not allowing ideas of ‘musicality’ to interfere with the directions the sound will take, it seems they are able to create something truly unique.</p>
<p>The second set proves darker than the first, denser and less inviting though no less seductive. Chris Abrahams finds something he likes in prestissimo bursts in the high notes. Swanton at first compliments and then consumes what the piano had started, physically wrestling his double bass, at times grimacing with the strain of playing the note series he’s constructing. Abrahams’ piano relents and he retreats first to soft, closed-fist relays on the extreme low end and then a massage-like fingertip sweep over a whole swathe of keys. Buck relies heavily on cymbals, which he plays with unerring precision even when reaching to the floor for another stick or brush. In the set’s final minutes he places three upturned hand cymbals on the snare and adds to the work he’s doing with his left hand on the ride cymbal a completely different and absolutely complimentary right-handed rhythm. This is how the second piece closes, with the piano coming to a soft rest, Swanton having tamed his rampant bass into something calmer and Buck’s hand mothwinging between bright cymbal tones.</p>
<p>And once it’s done it’s done. Unrepeatable, this is music that has come into being and has passed out of being in our presence. Not without its rough edges, not to the delight of every ear, but enormously impressive, utterly absorbing and entirely singular.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>To my mind the opening line of Bret Easton Ellis’s debut novel ranks alongside all of the famous examples you care to think of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With those ten words Ellis sends a message about the setting for his story, and about the people that inhabit it, as well as deftly setting the tone of his prose and introducing a concept central to the book: fear.</p>
<p>Rather than a merging, the movement which propels <em>Less Than Zero</em> is a downward spiral. Throughout the novel the protagonist moves from one club to another, one penthouse to another, one party to another – all the time gathering a terrible momentum which takes him to worse places, worse situations, worse people….</p>
<p>At first the people we meet are merely reprehensible. Every character Ellis introduces is obsessed with status and perception: lazy, rich, bored, self-interested to the point of obliviousness. They are so self-involved that they never show genuine interest in others, never remember details unless they pertain to themselves, and never form any genuine connections. There’s Kim, who learns her parents’ whereabouts from <em>Variety</em>; and Ronnette, convinced that the world will melt if she doesn’t dye her hair. In Ellis’s LA the bonds of money, drugs, and sex have primacy over friendship, family, and genuine intimacy.</p>
<p>Consider the paucity of true communication in this interchange between Blair and Clay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Clay?” she whispers loudly.<br>
I stop but don’t turn around. “Yeah?”<br>
“Nothing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dramatic weight of a loud whisper, the refusal to face the person who called your name, and then the terminus – another stillborn conversation between two people afraid of really speaking to one another rather than acting a part. These are people whose life is a constant drift between moments in which they are never truly engaged, and as a result a lack of certainty pervades every layer of the novel. Characters rarely have surnames, cases of mistaken identity are frequent, even Clay’s narration is full of holes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And somewhere along the line, Blair leaves with Rip or maybe with Trent, or maybe Rip leaves with Trent or maybe Rip leaves with the two blond girls, and I end up dancing with this girl and she leans over to me and whispers that maybe we should go to her place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At points Clay leaves out salient detail presumably due to lack of attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mumble something… After taking him to some emergency room at some hospital, we go to a coffee shop on Wilshire…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how the location of the coffee shop is recalled and relayed effortlessly. Brand names, street names, the names of hip clubs all carry a weight of importance absent from other areas of the characters’ lives.</p>
<p>And things only get worse. Throughout the novel there are a number of catalogues of disturbing material. Early on Clay recalls one summer that he collected newspaper reports on acts of horrendous violence “because, I guess there were a lot to be collected.” Towards the novel’s conclusion Clay recalls a similar number of violent acts (man-made and natural) that happened whilst he was in LA; the tumult is constant. And Clay is also collecting something else, even if unconsciously: fragments that hold some meaning for him, beginning with the book’s opening line and continuing throughout. These phrases, often with dark portent, appear in the narration once and then stick, Clay often repeating them at moments when he’s feeling most uncomfortable. So, whilst high at a tense family meal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think about Blair alone in her bed stroking that stupid black cat and the billboard that says, ‘Disappear Here’ and Julian’s eyes and wonder if he’s for sale and people are afraid to merge…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whilst witnessing the nadir of Julian’s arc, as the pimp Finn threatens him and injects him with drugs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disappear Here.<br>
The syringe fills with blood.<br>
You’re a beautiful boy and that’s all that matters.<br>
Wonder if he’s for sale.<br>
People are afraid to merge. To merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a panic attack in print. A loss of narrative coherence. Clay’s conscience screaming at him to take note, to be present in a moment and to feel something – to react. Eventually, at his most honest, he comes to realise that all that matters to him “is that I want to see the worst.”</p>
<p>This is an almost miraculous level of self-awareness for Clay – nothing short of a revelation which it takes him almost the entire novel to come to. It is obviously not a positive change in his character but it is an important first step. Axiomatically the first step in recovery from addiction is to admit that you have a problem: Clay’s addiction is to detachment and here he is working his way towards admitting it.</p>
<p>There have been signs throughout the novel that he wanted this. The half-dozen or so italicised passages in which Clay reminisces about earlier periods in his life contain little more in the way of genuine emotion than is found in his reporting of the present, so we know it’s something that he is capable of. At points he has to push back against the emerging idea that something is wrong, for example at the party in Malibu when he first notices that all of the attendees look alike and then starts “to wonder if I look just like them. I try to forget about it…”</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he voices his desire to see “the worst,” his wish is granted, as he finds himself out behind the club Flip with Rip and Spin (consider the disruptive connotations of all of those proper nouns), and in their company he reaches a new low.</p>
<p>The book’s darkest moments – the paedophilic rape and the video of a similar act that foreshadows it – are the far end of an experience spectrum for their deadened observers and perpetrators. These are the most extreme incidences of characters submitting themselves to ever greater levels of stimulation in the hope of being able to feel something, whilst at the same time remaining mortally afraid of doing just that.</p>
<p>Only at the pressured depths late in the novel, once he has sunk further, been closer to “the worst,” is Clay able to admit his dependence on detachment. In the novel’s closing moments Clay has a conversation with Blair that reveals him at his most emotionally honest: admitting to his emotional bankruptcy. She asks him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘What do you care about? What makes you happy?’<br>
‘Nothing. Nothing makes me happy. I like nothing,’ I tell her.<br>
[…]<br>
‘Did you ever care about me?’ she asks again.<br>
‘I don’t want to care. If I care about things, it’ll just be worse, it’ll just be another thing to worry about. It’s less painful if I don’t care.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Clay’s arc is unfinished. Though he reaches the milestone of admitting his problem, he leaves Los Angeles behind and we don’t know whether or not the progress will stick; his great revelation means nothing if he is unable to act upon it. The prospect of the upcoming sequel, <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em>, is exciting precisely because that question might just be answered. What has become of Clay in the last 25 years? And what too of that cavalcade of addicts, sociopaths and perverts that comprise the rest of the novel’s cast?</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for that opening line: Last night I dreamt I went to LA again.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2010/04/10/antichrist-dir-lars.html">Antichrist dir. Lars von Trier (2009)</a></h1>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Sitting comfortably in a dark room, dazzled by the light and the movement which exert a quasi-hypnotic power&hellip; fascinated by the interest of human faces and the rapid changes of place, [a] cultivated individual placidly accepts the most appalling themes&hellip;and all this naturally sanctioned by habitual morality, government, and international censorship, religion, dominated by good taste and enlivened by white humor and other prosaic imperatives of reality.</p>
<p>— Luis Bunuel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was impossible to approach <em>Antichrist</em> without preconceptions, even bias, based on the circus which surrounded it at 2009&rsquo;s Cannes Film Festival. Reading some of the coverage which came from that event it seemed one was duty-bound to feel outraged by Lars von Trier&rsquo;s film; whether at its arrogance, its ridiculousness, its sadism&hellip; the press had made it very clear to any would-be viewer that a tempered response was illegitimate. Charlotte Gainsbourg&rsquo;s mutilation of first Willem Dafoe&rsquo;s genitals and then her own must now rank alongside the sliced eyeball of Bunuel&rsquo;s <em>Un Chien Andalou</em> (1929) as one of cinema&rsquo;s most notorious body-horror scenes - but it would be such a shame if von Trier&rsquo;s film was remembered only on that basis.</p>
<p>There are sequences of great beauty in <em>Antichrist</em>. The opening, in which Gainsbourg and Dafoe&rsquo;s She and He make love whilst their child steps from a second storey window to his death in the snow below is visually stunning. Shot in black and white by Anthony Dod Mantle (outdoing even his Oscar-winning work on <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> (2008)) it is set to Handel&rsquo;s <em>Lascia Ch&rsquo;io Pianga</em> to spellbinding effect; those opening minutes should be enough to convince you that your presuppositions about the film are likely wrong.</p>
<p><em>Antichrist</em> is not a body-horror film. Much as Eli Roth and the <em>Saw</em> films would like to be considered alongside it, <em>Antichrist</em> is a different animal. I watched the film on Easter Sunday, which may seem a perverse choice but proved to be strangely apt. Easter and the coming of spring is all about re-birth, rejuvenation and renewal, and von Trier is investigating all of these themes through the prism of a woman who has seemingly come to be terrified by them.</p>
<p>If the film has a thesis it is summed up with Gainsbourg&rsquo;s line: &ldquo;Nature is Satan&rsquo;s church&rdquo;. Whether because of the child&rsquo;s death or some earlier incident (we are never given the full picture of what happened the last time She was at the cabin with her son) She is morbidly afraid of Nature, and specifically of its ability to reproduce. The acorn terrifies her as a symbol of the forest&rsquo;s vitality and longevity, her destruction of both of their sex organs is incited by her fear of her own reproductive abilities.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg&rsquo;s performance is outstanding. The role calls for incredible bravery and selflessness and she is absolutely unafraid to commit to every moment of her character&rsquo;s bottomless grief. Her Cannes award for best actress is thoroughly deserved, and one can&rsquo;t help but think that she would have been more widely lauded if the film hadn&rsquo;t been ghettoised as a &ldquo;horror&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The overall effect of the film is to leave the viewer drained, von Trier having strung us along, built the tension slowly, and then unleashed a torrent in his last 20 minutes such that we are unlikely to recover for quite a while after the credits roll. It may be his finest film.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last stanza, and really just those last two lines, of Robert Frost&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening&rsquo; (1923) always struck me as a little bleak; it gives an otherwise pretty poem a hint of something which might be longing or even despair. This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning novel finds a man (Viggo Mortensen) also possessed of the need to keep moving and the desire to keep promises. We witness him telling his wife (Charlize Theron) that he will &ldquo;do whatever it takes&rdquo; to help their family survive the apocalypse which is upon them, and over the 111 minutes of John Hillcoat&rsquo;s film he is put to that test again and again.</p>
<p>Theron&rsquo;s part is fleeting, as is that of every other cast member save Mortensen and his character&rsquo;s son, The Boy, as played by 13 year old Kodi Smit-McPhee. The film boils down to two hours spent in their company as they do little more than try to survive in a blighted landscape. Hillcoat punctuates the journey nicely with set pieces such as encounters with gangs of cannibals or the discovery of a bunker stocked with food, and also with Mortensen&rsquo;s The Man remembering or dreaming of his life in the Before with his wife. The Man wakes from these dreams with a start and a cry; part of him wishes to relinquish all memory of the past as it causes him such pain. In one scene we watch as he nudges his wedding ring ever closer to a precipice, but in the end he cannot make the final push. This is what The Man seems to fear most: his inability to follow through, to keep those promises. We watch as he instructs his son on the proper way to commit suicide, and listen in as he ponders in voice-over whether he would be able to take The Boy&rsquo;s life if it came to it. Hillcoat handles this material, all of which he inherits from McCarthy, with a deft hand, never overplaying the heartache nor being afraid to show it when it is required. For all of its post-apocalyptic trappings this is at its heart a love story, and one concerned with that love rarest of all on the cinema screen: that between a father and son. McCarthy dedicates his novel to his own son, and Hillcoat and Mortensen correctly identifies that as the story&rsquo;s most powerful and most important thread.</p>
<p>Mortensen&rsquo;s performance is necessarily understated in that his character lacks energy and is sickening as the film progresses, but he is the kind of actor who can do a lot by doing very little. Hillcoat wisely shoots his star&rsquo;s face in close-up so that we can see all of the expression Mortensen is putting behind The Man&rsquo;s words (Joe Penhall does an admirable job of appropriating and supplementing McCarthy&rsquo;s sparse and repetitive, yet beautiful, dialogue). And Smit-McPhee, in his first major role, does exceedingly well with very difficult material, which arguably requires more emotion from his character than from his fellow lead&rsquo;s. Watching him enjoy his first and probably last Coca-Cola is touching because he reacts with believable joy.</p>
<p>Hillcoat has also assembled an impressive supporting cast, with Michael Kenneth Willams and Guy Pearce doing well with minimal screen time. If there is a performance which outshines Mortensen&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Robert Duvall as The Old Man; restrained but astonishingly emotive and moving he is every inch the defeated old soul that the film requires, giving a glimpse of what longevity might bring for The Boy. Like the film&rsquo;s protagonists The Old Man is going onwards simply because there is nothing else to do; he provides a possible answer to the Beckettian question which McCarthy is asking: of what value is it to simply carry on for the sake of carrying on?</p>
<p>Javier Aguirresarobe&rsquo;s cinematography makes for an oddly beautiful film. Though the landscape in which the story is set is ruined his camera gives it a majesty by allowing us to see the scope and variety of the devastation. His palette is as washed out and bleak in the majority of the scenes as it is vivid and beautiful in the few remembrances The Man allows himself; one simple image of Theron in a sun-dress lingers long after the end credits. The tone of the film is also supported wonderfully by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis&rsquo;s score. Simple and haunting it is loaded with loss and longing; its composers obviously understanding the heart of the film just as well as its director and leading man. As well as the sad strings and plaintive piano of the score though, Hillcoat makes masterful use throughout of environmental noise. Almost from start to finish The Man and The Boy are surrounded by the sound of the world collapsing, giving in or straining at the seams. The tearing crash of falling trees, the groan and growl of rending earth and deep percussive booms that sound like icebergs breaking apart, all frame the landscape wonderfully and make the environment as prominent a part of the story as it should be.</p>
<p>In many respects John Hillcoat was in a lose / lose situation when he signed on to make The Road. Had he gone for a strict adaptation of McCarthy&rsquo;s novel it would have made for a practically un-watchable film. Stray too far from the beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning source and all of its many admirers would be sure to point out his film&rsquo;s failings. Add to that the fact that the last adaptation of the author&rsquo;s work (the Coen brothers' <em>No Country For Old Men</em> (2007)) won four of the most prestigious Academy Awards and you have a project freighted with impossible expectations. Hillcoat walks this tightrope with admirable surety and he has made a film which is a perfect balance of McCarthy&rsquo;s vision and his own. It is best enjoyed as a cinematic article, divorced from the source text, but excellent performances and masterful film-making should make that easy.</p>
