			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again. Today, I kicked some dry leaves on a walk into town, bought and drank my traditional one-per-annum Pumpkin Spice Latte‚Ñ¢, and listened to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1589139584"><em>Red (Taylor&rsquo;s Version)</em></a> with rapture.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A whole 364 days ago, I wrote what proved to be <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/tendrils022/">the final issue</a> (to date) of my erstwhile newsletter. In it, I explained the reasons behind my practice of taking an extended period each year, away from the social internet. I won&rsquo;t repeat all that here; it suffices to say that when the Chicago Cubs are playing baseball, you&rsquo;ll find me online, and when they&rsquo;re not, I aim to be far less connected. The way things have worked out, a rough month for the Cubs has seen playoff hopes evaporate, and the final game of the season is due to start in just a few hours' time. Hence, I&rsquo;m publishing this note to say goodbye for a while ‚Äî there will be less activity here between now and next spring.</p>
<p>Some people reading this may recall that, last time around, the whole &lsquo;defaulting to disconnection&rsquo; thing didn&rsquo;t work out as planned. Elon Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->RIP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) a few weeks after I pulled the plugs, created such fascinating turmoil that I couldn&rsquo;t look away. As I wrote here <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html">back in January</a>, the earthquakes sent through the landscape of the social web felt genuinely exciting for a while. Mastodon had a moment; Bluesky threatened to have a moment, and then never really did; many others (cohost; T2 / Pebble; Nostr; Post News) made ripples of varying sizes; Meta launched Threads to great fanfare, and then set about the harder work of making it stick. All of which is beside the point to a large extent, save to say that ‚Äî for me ‚Äî the excitement has given way to baseline intrigue. The rise and fall of individual platforms is less interesting than the fact that things are changing. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve very much enjoyed continuing to share notes and updates of various types right here.</p>
<p>Will I continue to post throughout my offline season? Possibly. The long-heralded trip to Japan is a few weeks away, and will likely yield a good number of photos ‚Äî some of those will probably appear here. I&rsquo;ll also feel free to drop by with anything else that seems worth saying. As explained in that post from a year ago, this isn&rsquo;t a monastic practice, but a shift in default. One thing is virtually certain: the <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/thelists">end of year list</a> of my favourite records of 2023 will be posted in the final week of the year.</p>
<p>For now, let me wish you a happy and cosy autumn and winter. Keep the internet warm for me, and I hope to be back here with you next spring. The Cubs play the White Sox, Friday 23 February 2024, 14:05 CST.</p>

			 <p>With the exception of a few key things ‚Äî¬†travel money; travel insurance; transport to the airport ‚Äî¬†it feels increasingly as though the planning for our upcoming trip to Japan is in good shape. All of the hotels are booked; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SIM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cards are in hand; rail passes are winging their way here as I type; I even managed to successfully navigate the byzantine complexities of booking tickets for Universal Studios.</p>
<p>Alongside all of the admin, there have been a couple of other strands of prep: I&rsquo;ve been watching a <em>lot</em> of YouTube videos (of varying quality and usefulness), and taking notes as I&rsquo;ve made my way through the guidebooks I <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/06/20/back-in-january.html">posted about a while ago</a>. Another book just got added to that stack, with the news that W. David Marx&rsquo;s <em>Ametora: How Japan Saved American Style</em> (2015) is <a href="https://culture.ghost.io/ametora-revised-edition-2023/">being reissued in a revised edition</a>.<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to read more Japanese fiction in the run-up. I&rsquo;ve long been an admirer of some of the bigger names: I read some Banana Yoshimoto in my teens; Haruki Murakami, about whom I&rsquo;ve written before (<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2015/01/17/in-praise-of.html">1</a>, <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv2">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2020/04/12/a-feminist-critique.html">3</a>); &amp; Sayaka Murata (whose <em>Convenience Store Woman</em> (2016 trans. 2018) remains one of my favourite reading surprises in recent memory. In an effort to broaden those horizons somewhat, I&rsquo;m currently enjoying Emi Yagi‚Äôs <em>Diary of a Void</em> (2023) &amp; Seich≈ç Matsumoto‚Äôs <em>Tokyo Express</em> (1958 trans. 2023).<br>

			 <p>I have just archived 63% of the entries in my Contacts, keeping only the people I&rsquo;ve communicated with ‚Äî one way or another ‚Äî¬†across the last five years or so. It&rsquo;s amazing how much extraneous stuff builds up in these places if you&rsquo;re not paying attention: your old landlord; people you worked with for two weeks, eight years ago; window cleaners from other places you&rsquo;ve lived.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another tier, of folks you once called friends, but one or other of you moved on from a job, or a city. There&rsquo;s a tinge of sadness in archiving those names and numbers, and it&rsquo;s partially attributable to how historically poor I am at keeping in touch with people. Honestly, it&rsquo;s bordering on a failure to grasp object permanence! People who still regularly talk with their old school friends, and former colleagues, put me to shame.</p>
<p>When it comes to physical clutter, I try my hardest to resist the <a href="https://youtu.be/9dmeWE-qfMo">&lsquo;Monica&rsquo;s closet&rsquo;</a> approach; I&rsquo;m pretty good at letting that stuff go. When it comes to digital clutter though, I see little harm in keeping it around past its immediate usefulness, as long as it&rsquo;s all organised in some way. I have a partitioned external hard drive dedicated to timestamped backups and archives of this kind: a whole lot of 1s &amp; 0s, not cluttering up the place day-to-day, but retrievable if it should become necessary. You never know when someone might ask for a window cleaner recommendation.</p>

			 <p><strong>Another batch of quick notes:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Circumstances over the last couple of weeks have conspired to preclude my seeing <a href="https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/past-lives"><em>Past Lives</em></a> in cinemas, which I&rsquo;m disappointed about. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll arrive on MUBI in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Depending on the day you ask, I might tell you that my favourite record of all time is Nirvana&rsquo;s <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1440858699"><em>In Utero</em> (1993)</a>, which was released <strong>30 years ago today</strong>.</p>

			 <p><strong>As an experiment, things I‚Äôve jotted down during the day:</strong></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ A striking sentiment in this piece by <a href="https://newsletterss.com/post/2VWWSt7Zjsq3yoKyv9gNYt5AgFa/rss">Annie Lowrey</a>:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You read a poem; it takes three minutes or 20 minutes; you get drop-kicked out of the galaxy and torn apart and rebuilt and returned home anew.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ The mix of sounds and styles on <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1690201036">Corinne Bailey Rae‚Äôs new LP</a> is head-spinning.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Eight days since I <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/09/09/yesterday-afternoon-i.html">messed my ankle up</a> ‚Äî¬†the swelling has receded; most of the bruising has begun to fade a little; I‚Äôm now fairly mobile on the flat, and going up stairs, but down stairs remains a tricky proposition. Still quite a fair bit of soreness though, and if that persists a few days beyond the bruising, maybe I‚Äôll go see about an x-ray to check I didn‚Äôt fracture something.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Very much enjoyed my second playthrough of the Puma Blue LP: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1682664550"><em>Holy Waters</em></a> (2023)</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ I loved this Sophie Robinson poem: <a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/sophie-robinson-poem/">‚Äòart in america‚Äô</a></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Babak Jalali‚Äôs <a href="https://youtu.be/wu8CzVfik-4"><em>Fremont</em> (2023)</a> isn‚Äôt playing anywhere near me right now, but I will absolutely see it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASAP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢¬†I‚Äôve kept an eye on Cory Doctorow‚Äôs work for many years; the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/have-a-nice-future-podcast-21/">latest episode of Wired‚Äôs <em>Have a Nice Future</em> podcast</a> is a succinct encapsulation of where his thoughts about the internet stand right now.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I need to go and update iOS, chiefly so that I can create inline links in Apple Notes!</p>

			 <p>For the record, I don&rsquo;t listen to all that much metal. I used to ‚Äî¬†for around a decade, starting in the mid 90s, it was one of the staples of my listening diet. My most music-obsessed friend still enjoys a lot of the stuff, and suggestion from him is how most of the metal crops up on these lists. I&rsquo;m always happy to dip into any record once, and every now and again, I still find something that ignites a spark. I mention this now because there&rsquo;s a new Otep LP released this week, and <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/724782295">their debut ep from 2001</a> was a revelation to me at the time. I do not hold out much hope that this new album will have similar impact. üéµ</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently deep in the planning stages for a trip to Japan in a couple of months' time. Flights and hotels are all booked, and SIM cards have been acquired. I&rsquo;ve done my research on things like public transport and the necessity of having both cash and a Suica card in your pocket at all times. I&rsquo;ve figured out which Japan Rail Pass option works best (given that we&rsquo;re going to be using it both directions between Tokyo and Kyoto, as well as down to Osaka), I just need to pre-order it for collection.</p>
<p>Honestly, the most confusing aspect of the whole trip so far has been coming to grips with the overly-complex method for securing entry to <a href="https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/about">Super Nintendo World</a>!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The most recent research I&rsquo;ve been conducting is on architecturally significant buildings, and I wanted to take a second to note the extent to which Kenz≈ç Tange&rsquo;s design for St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral in Sekiguchi (constructed 1963-4), resembles a PlayStation 5.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>A note of follow-up to <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/09/12/its-that-time.html">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>: the Apple event went pretty much as expected. They got that brief Apple Vision Pro segment in at the top, and unveiled some neat evolutions to both Apple Watch and iPhone. The former arguably got the bigger bump, with the new phones a more modest update. Nevertheless, I saw what I needed to regarding the camera specifically: the jump from the 12MP on my iPhone 12, to the 48MP on an iPhone 15 (with double the optical zoom) is substantial.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from the new hardware, I applaud the company&rsquo;s discontinuation of leather products. This was framed as part of a comprehensive environmental sustainability project, but also has significant animal welfare implications.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s that time again: Apple Event day, and this is an upgrade year for me. More by circumstance than design, I tend to pick up every third iPhone. And, whilst the performance of my iPhone 12 is still perfectly good, the battery has certainly started to degrade. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of planning a trip to Japan this autumn, and I&rsquo;ll want to have the best camera possible in my pocket. I&rsquo;m excited to tune in a little later and learn what&rsquo;s on offer; my expectation is that ‚Äî¬†beyond the switch to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->USB-C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the debut of Dynamic Island on non-Pro models ‚Äî¬†the hardware will be a relatively modest update.</p>
<p>Beyond the new iPhones, and the expected new Apple Watch model, I&rsquo;m wondering whether any time will be devoted to Apple Vision Pro. Even if it&rsquo;s limited to a short segment showcasing a different use case, I&rsquo;d expect that Apple will want to remind the world that the product exists, and is shipping relatively soon.</p>
<p>On the software side: there&rsquo;s plenty in iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, &amp; macOS Sonoma that I&rsquo;m keen to play with<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.

<p>Another set of visual inspo bookmarks, as I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/categories/visual-inspo/">shared before</a>. Previously, I was cataloguing these in a service called Savee, which is still a good source, but I don&rsquo;t recommend the tool: significant elements of their Pro plan simply do not work, and their customer service was lacking. I did some looking around at alternatives (eg. <a href="https://dropmark.com">Dropmark</a>, which I used many years ago; <a href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>, which seems popular), but I&rsquo;ve now taken to scrapbooking them in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-freeform-a-powerful-new-app-designed-for-creative-collaboration/">Freeform</a>, which is proving to be ideal for just this sort of thing.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/olivia-rodrigo-and-phoebe-bridgers-let-it-all-out">conversation between Olivia Rodrigo &amp; Phoebe Bridgers</a> was fun ‚Äî¬†including the part where they start talking about <em>Beau is Afraid</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RODRIGO: I watched that new Ari Aster movie <em>Beau Is Afraid</em> and I got so scared. I literally had to walk out of the theater. I have never had such a visceral reaction to a movie in my life. It felt like a bad acid trip.</p>
<p>BRIDGERS: [Laughs] I&rsquo;m so glad you brought that up, because you are right. That is the scariest movie I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but I was laughing the entire time.</p>
<p>RODRIGO: That&rsquo;s the only reasonable reaction. Your body just can&rsquo;t process it. You have to laugh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently bought <em>Beau is Afraid</em>. When I saw it back in May, it was one of the most intense moviegoing experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had, and I&rsquo;m fascinated to return and pick apart why (particularly, but not exclusively) the opening act worked on me so profoundly. I can see it slotting in next to Aronofsky&rsquo;s <em>mother!</em>, Nicolas Winding Refn&rsquo;s <em>The Neon Demon</em>, and Julia Ducournau&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/titane"><em>Titane</em></a> as another film I love, but can put myself through only very infrequently! üçø</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d seen this piece ‚Äî¬†Business Insider: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-dead-instagram-tiktok-bereal-replaced-group-chats-messaging-2023-8">&lsquo;Social Media is Dead&rsquo;</a> ‚Äî¬†doing the rounds recently. Essentially, it argues that there&rsquo;s a move underway from broadcast-style social media, towards smaller, closed-group socialising. Since the main feed has become a place for celebrities, influencers, and brands, it has come to feel less and less like a place for regular people to post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture in general has kept a lot of people from showing up because they don&rsquo;t think their life is aesthetic, or they don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re selling anything, so why would they post on social media?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rings true. The aspect that&rsquo;s less-discussed is the extent to which the &lsquo;new&rsquo;, less open mode of social sharing is still taking place on some of the same apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s this sublayer of Instagram that&rsquo;s much more true to what the app once was, but it is just not viewable to the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the decline in public posting from regular users means very little to the companies who own the platforms, because &lsquo;while sharing has tailed off, consuming content hasn&rsquo;t slowed&rsquo;. Meta doesn&rsquo;t really care how much or how little you post, as long as your engagement time stays high. Whether or not you publish your own content, if you&rsquo;re still seeing others', you&rsquo;re still seeing adverts.</p>
<p>The existential threat to these platforms comes when folks get what they want from their smaller, closed groups, and decide on a media diet that doesn&rsquo;t include corporations and famous people. The mental leap away from viewing mainstream social media as &lsquo;social&rsquo;, and towards viewing it as &lsquo;media&rsquo; is a useful one. If the main feed isn&rsquo;t a place to share anymore, it&rsquo;s just another source of entertainment, interspersed with a lot of adverts.</p>

<p>Last night I went to see <a href="https://boxd.it/xX9c"><em>Passages</em> (2023)</a>, a beautifully-shot love triangle tragedy set in Paris. The mechanism of the film is essentially the central character making a series of selfish, ego-driven decisions (or, more accurately, acting on his own desires without much consideration). Those around him ‚Äî¬†and principally those with whom he&rsquo;s romantically involved ‚Äî are seen struggling with the profound repercussions. As the third act arrives, you&rsquo;re desperate for other characters to finally draw a line, and call him out. Judging from overheard conversation during the credits, some people in the audience struggled with the protagonist&rsquo;s lack of development. It&rsquo;s certainly frustrating, but I found it to be an accurate portrayal of narcissism: people like Tomas (Franz Rogowski) rarely change, and certainly not overnight. The point in the film at which his claims to have done so are disbelieved, brings genuine catharsis.</p>
<p>Ben Whishaw is subtle and tender as Tomas&rsquo;s husband, and Ad√®le Exarchopoulos is characteristically soulful. These two are the film&rsquo;s principal loci of empathy, your admiration and sympathy increasing as you become evermore infuriated by Tomas.<br>

<p>Looking for something a little less emotionally fraught, I came home and streamed C√©line Devaux&rsquo;s feature debut, <a href="https://boxd.it/yQnS"><em>Tout le monde aime Jeanne</em> (2022)</a> ‚Äî a light, mature romantic comedy that also touches on loss and depression. The most obviously unique touch is the insertion of kinetic and characterful hand-drawn illustrations (also by Devaux), which certainly make the eponymous protagonist&rsquo;s anxious internal monologue more palatable. I was also taken by the choice to saturate the whole film with bold, rich colour. It somehow served to ground the characters in a vibrant, safe-seeming world, even whilst they struggle. As Laurent Lafitte&rsquo;s Jean says at one point, ‚Äòanxiety is more difficult in beautiful settings‚Äô. üçø</p>

<p>Last night I was present to watch <a href="https://www.chrisfarren.com/">Chris Farren</a> demolish the hottest, sweatiest room in Oxford. The set list, heavy on (excellent) latest album <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1683023812"><em>Doom Singer</em></a>, was raucous and played at 110% volume. Adorned with some humour and vibrant projections, at heart this was the purest rock spectacle available in the city on a Monday night.

			 <p>On last week&rsquo;s episode of <em>The Vergecast</em>, host Nilay Patel <a href="https://youtu.be/DzZ_tQhRVvk?t=3320">requested that listeners send photos of their childhood computer rooms</a>. A photo of me from c. 1992 sprang to mind, so I sent it in. I did not, however, expect to get brutally roasted in the caption.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aside from the weird sartorial decisions, there are a couple of elements of this photo that I like. I&rsquo;m playing <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, which I think puts this somewhere between Christmas 1992 ‚Äî when I got my Mega Drive ‚Äî¬†and summer 1993, when we moved out of this house. I remember a good number of the Atari ST games in that box of floppy discs. It&rsquo;s fitting that <em>Lemmings</em> is at the front though, because that was my mum&rsquo;s one and only gaming obsession until <em>Candy Crush</em> some three decades later. I also like the oversized game boxes on the shelf above, which would have held a couple of floppies and an instruction manual, but bigger meant more shelf space. In particular I remember loving that <em>Simpsons</em> game that is right in front of me. And finally, as if this photo wasn&rsquo;t 90s enough, check out the pair of phone books!</p>

			 <p>If chess isn&rsquo;t your thing (yet), you would be forgiven for thinking that chess is chess. But even for games played by the normal rules of chess, there‚Äôs a huge variety of time controls that have dramatic impacts on play. You can, of course, play without any time limit, free to leave <em>days</em> between moves if you wish. Games at the FIDE World Cup ‚Äî which is in its final stages at the moment ‚Äî¬†are played with 90 minutes on each player‚Äôs clock for the first 40 moves, and an additional 30 minutes added after move 40. Also, 30 seconds are added per move. This is a version of the classical chess format, which has endured throughout the game‚Äôs long history. But other time controls have gained popularity, perhaps particularly since the advent of online chess. There is Rapid chess, where players might start with anything from 60 minutes to 10 minutes on the clock; Blitz, where clocks start with five or even three minutes, and sometimes two seconds might be added per move; and Bullet, where games can start with as little as 30 seconds on the clock!</p>
<p>But those are just the chess formats that use the normal rules. There are also numerous variations that tweak the way the game itself is played. For example, there is Chess960, wherein the order of pieces on each player‚Äôs home rank is randomised; Crazyhouse, in which pieces you capture can be redeployed on your side; and 4 Player Chess, in which‚Ä¶ there are four players, and four sets of pieces on one (larger) board. And that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant">chess variants</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There has also been an explosion in the number and variety of chess video games, many of which feature fun spins on the game. See, as just two examples, <a href="https://shotgun-king.com/"><em>Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</em></a>, and Zach Gage‚Äôs <a href="http://reallybadchess.com/"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>.</p>
<p>I mention <strong>all of this</strong> because I recently had an idea for a new variation, which I‚Äôm calling Meteorite Chess. The game uses the usual setup of chess pieces, and proceeds as a normal game of chess. The twist is that at set intervals (ie. every three or five moves) one square on the board becomes highlighted, and after the subsequent moves, that square is hit by a meteorite. I can see there being two versions of the game: Meteorite &amp; Meteorite Oblivion. In the latter version, when the meteorite hits the highlighted square, any piece on that square is destroyed, and removed from the board. This is the simpler version of the game, but it still requires both players to adapt their play to accommodate squares which become temporarily hazardous. The game design trick would be in making sure that the squares were selected in a fair way. For example, no squares on the 1, 2, 7, or 8 ranks should probably be targeted at the beginning of the game. Perhaps they become eligible to be meteor struck after 30 moves, incentivising players to develop their pieces earlier. The fun of the game would be to embrace its randomness, but there could also be tweaks to guard against the feeling of unfairness ‚Äî¬†eg. a setting to provide two moves‚Äô worth of warning before a meteor strikes.</p>
<p>In the non-Oblivion version of the game, things get a little trickier, and perhaps a little more interesting. Here, instead of destroying the piece on the targeted square, the meteorite <em>devolves</em> it to a lesser piece. So, a struck queen becomes a rook; a rook becomes a knight or bishop; a bishop becomes a pawn; and a struck pawn is destroyed. In the majority of instances, this would still prove an incentive for players to avoid the targeted square, <em>but</em> it would give rise to fascinating board states where it might prove beneficial for a player to deliberately move a rook onto the highlighted square, because devolving it into a knight would provide a positional advantage! Again, there are options here to tweak the rules to make things more or less punishing: perhaps a setting that includes some devolving meteorites, and some that outright destroy, as well as the option to either indicate which type of meteorite is coming, or not. Heck, maybe there could even be <em>evolving</em> meteorites, which would increase struck pieces: knight to rook; rook to Queen etc.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2022/04/21/idea-for-a.html">I‚Äôve said here before</a>, I‚Äôm not a game designer. But if anyone reading this would like to make use of this idea, feel free! ‚ôüÔ∏è</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9Hy29KoBnGY"><em>Jetpac</em></a> was one of my absolute childhood favourites for the ZX Spectrum, and I have fond memories of <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> exploding my mind at Christmas in 1994. How did I not know they were made by the same people? So many of Rare&rsquo;s titles have brought me joy over the years, including (but not limited to) <em>Killer Instinct</em>, <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, <em>Perfect Dark</em>, &amp; <em>Viva Pi√±ata</em>. After reading this piece, I&rsquo;m tempted to check out the <em>Rare Replay</em> compilation of 30 games, which they released for the company&rsquo;s 30th anniversary. I&rsquo;ve just noticed it includes <em>Jetpac</em>!</p>

			 <p>Nice to see that Jason Heyward&rsquo;s recent success in LA has warranted a piece in the <em>NY Times</em>. He was <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/31/over-the-last.html">one of my favourite players</a> to watch, particularly in the early years of his contract with the Cubs, and it&rsquo;s a delight to see him having a season worth noting. The article starts with an unnecessarily pointed dig at Heyward&rsquo;s former club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he can still help a team, which is more than the Chicago Cubs seemed to think when they decided to cut ties with him last August</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as the piece goes on, it does lay out the case for his having been let go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Heyward‚Äôs O.P.S. dropped to career lows in consecutive seasons ‚Äî .627 in 2021 and .556 in 2022 ‚Äî it was evident that his time there was done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s kind of the point of the piece: Heyward&rsquo;s 2023 season to date has been an unexpected upswing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heyward‚Äôs on-base plus slugging percentage (.797) is his highest over a full season since 2015. He has produced the best isolated power (.216), home run percentage (4.2 percent) and walk rate (11.5 percent) of his career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not mentioned are the struggles that have been experienced by Heyward&rsquo;s replacement in Chicago: Seiya Suzuki, whose workload has recently been reduced to give him space to work on his plate approach. There was, however, one piece that stung: Heyward&rsquo;s admission that ‚ÄúThe toughest thing for me was not trying to win every day‚Äù. The Cubs' post-World Series decline, and quick collapse into a rebuild, are much discussed. It pained me a little to hear that Heyward shared fans' impatience with the front office&rsquo;s strategy. ‚öæÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Today I sent the final newsletter issue of this summer&rsquo;s <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">Sipped Ink</a> read-along, bringing to a close six weeks of enjoying Barbara Kingsolver&rsquo;s fantastic novel <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780571376490"><em>Demon Copperhead</em></a> (2022). As always with this project, I come away from it feeling both energised by the community ‚Äî¬†it&rsquo;s great to have carved out a discrete space to discuss books ‚Äî¬†and a little drained. I was better about my own schedule this year than I have been in the past, when it was too common that the weekend arrived with me still having all the reading to do, let alone the note-taking and newsletter writing. For the most part I stayed on top of it this year, having been better about taking notes during the week, which were easier to flesh out on the weekends.</p>
<p>It helped that the novel was so good. I don&rsquo;t do any kind of organised reader feedback, but my instinct is that the best of these read-alongs have been when the book is eminently readable. That might sound obvious, but it&rsquo;s actually counter to the spirit in which I started the whole enterprise. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s understandable that participants feel the most engaged with the easier-to-read titles (<em>The Goldfinch</em>, <em>Great Circle</em>, &amp; <em>Demon Copperhead</em> amongst them), but I initially started the read-along as an accountability mechanism to push me through longer, more challenging works (<em>Infinite Jest</em>, <em>2666</em>). This shouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken for a complaint ‚Äî¬†I also very much enjoy reading these more popular books ‚Äî¬†but it makes me wonder what the reception would be amongst current participants if I was to move back towards longer or more complex novels.</p>
<p>Now that the read-along is done, I&rsquo;m flush with the giddy freedom of being able to choose to read whatever I want! There&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781668016138">a new Stephen King</a> on the horizon, but that&rsquo;s three weeks away. Before then, I&rsquo;m hoping to pick up a couple from my <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/toread">&lsquo;Want To Read&rsquo;</a> stack.  üìö</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve just finished Barbara Kingsolver&rsquo;s superb novel <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780571376490"><em>Demon Copperhead</em></a> (2022), winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the Women&rsquo;s Prize for Fiction (and yet, curiously not nominated for the Booker Prize). The book was my pick for this summer&rsquo;s instalment of my annual read-along project, <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">Sipped Ink</a>, and as such, most of what I have to say about it has made its way into <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv9">the weekly newsletters</a> over the last six weeks. I will say that it&rsquo;s absolutely proven to be one of those novels that I&rsquo;m simultaneously sad to finish and glad to have read.

			 <p>Another Wes Anderson note for the day, since I just watched <em>The Afterparty</em> s2e4. Say what you will about the specifics of Anderson&rsquo;s filmmaking style, but imagine having crafted a bespoke look and tone unique enough to be parodied. Other episodes of <em>The Afterparty</em> have co-opted the styles of whole eras (regency period), and genres (romcom; noir; heist), but s4e2 is borrowing solely from Anderson. How many other filmmakers could you do this for and expect wide recognition from the audience of a half hour comedy? Hitchcock? Miyazaki? Tarantino maybe? Even then, I think it would read to many as a broader adoption of the genres in which they operate. üçøüì∫</p>

			 <p>Ever since I saw <em>Asteroid City</em> a few weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve been pondering a re-watch of Wes Anderson&rsquo;s whole back catalogue. Reading this <a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2023/07/26/movies-watched-june-2023/">piece by Khoi Vinh</a> has suggested a new frame through which to do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anderson is a child at heart, of course, and that shows up countless times in his films, whether it‚Äôs in his scripts or his stage dressing or his picture book-like cinematography. However, the flip side of this youthful empathy is that Anderson is essentially lost when it comes to adult characters and, by extension, stories about adults. For me, this is the weakness that sabotages films like <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em> and the abysmal <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>, which are populated with nonsensical, schematized characters that talk at one another but never truly interact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My personal ranking of Anderson&rsquo;s movies, as it stands right now, looks like this:</p>
<p>1 ‚Äî <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em><br>
2 ‚Äî <em>Asteroid City</em><br>
3 ‚Äî <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em><br>
4 ‚Äî <em>The French Dispatch</em><br>
5 ‚Äî <em>Rushmore</em><br>
6 ‚Äî <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em><br>
7 ‚Äî <em>Isle of Dogs</em><br>
8 ‚Äî <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em><br>
9 ‚Äî <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em><br>
10 ‚Äî <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em><br>
11 ‚Äî <em>Bottle Rocket</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d call <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em> &lsquo;abysmal&rsquo; as Vinh does, but it&rsquo;s one of a few that I&rsquo;ve only seen once. I recall coming away from it very disappointed, and I don&rsquo;t recall now what it was about the film that didn&rsquo;t work for me. I find it interesting that Vinh offers a reason for the relative weakness of both <em>Darjeeling</em> &amp; <em>Life Aquatic</em> that I&rsquo;d not considered before ‚Äî it might be fun to go back through Anderson&rsquo;s oeuvre with this in mind. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->FWIW<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>Bottle Rocket</em> is another I&rsquo;ve seen only once, and which felt to me like Anderson&rsquo;s <em>Pablo Honey</em>: by no means bad, but containing only glimpses of future greatness.) üçø</p>

			 <p>This morning the longlist was announced for this year‚Äôs Booker Prize, and it is not what I had expected. Perhaps my perspective has been mildly warped by the fact that I‚Äôm currently leading <a href="https://zioibi.com/siv9">a group read-along</a> of <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, but ‚Äî¬†having won both the Pulitzer Prize &amp; the Women‚Äôs Prize for Fiction ‚Äî¬†it felt like Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs novel was a lock for the list. Not only that, I had also anticipated spots amongst the thirteen longlisted novels<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for Eleanor Catton‚Äôs <em>Birnam Wood</em>; Catherine Lacy‚Äôs <em>Biography of X</em>; Salman Rushdie‚Äôs <em>Victory City</em>; and possibly John Banville‚Äôs <em>The Singularities</em>. So, all told, I went 0/5 on these predictions!</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f2bfxtxxkaatnca.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The vast majority of these titles are new to me, and I‚Äôve read none of them.

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/19/top-weezer-songs.html">Top 5 Weezer Songs</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You can blame this one on <a href="https://brett.seybert.me/2023/07/19/the-best-weezer.html">Brett Seybert</a> ‚Äî who in turn is blaming it on <a href="https://www.welcometohellworld.com/the-world-has-turned-and-left-me-here/">Luke O‚ÄôNeil</a> ‚Äî¬† but I‚Äôll never pass up a chance to talk Weezer, so here we go.</p>
<p>To begin, let me say that I‚Äôm calling this the ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô Memorial List, for two reasons: a) the band‚Äôs most famous song<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is too easy a pick; b) it‚Äôs unbeatable and I need to cheat to get it on this list somehow. So, just for the record, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is a perfect song; the guitar lick at 2:09 would be on my list of top 5 <em>moments</em> in recorded music<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It was my introduction to the band, at age 14, in my high school computer room. The inclusion of the (all-time great) music video on the Windows 95 install CD remains both inexplicable, and sort of magical in my mind. So yes, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is not on this list, but‚Ä¶ you know üòâ</p>
<h3 id="jamie-1993">Jamie (1993)</h3>
<p>Only fitting then, that my first pick<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is the b-side from the ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô single. Holy smokes! Has there ever been a better a-side / b-side CD single?<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Rivers Cuomo is famously prolific, and he has an ear for melody that is second-to-none. I can‚Äôt imagine any other artists dashing off a quirky, sweet paean to their band‚Äôs lawyer. That opening feedback, the rumbling riff, the heartfelt lyrics, chant-along bridge, croon-along chorus. Weird and wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="you-gave-your-love-to-me-softly-1995">You Gave Your Love to Me Softly (1995)</h3>
<p>Maybe the world‚Äôs sweetest 100mph rock ballad? A riff that burns like a lit fuse; another extremely ‚Äòjoin in at full volume‚Äô chorus; a squealer of a solo‚Ä¶ all packed in to less than two minutes. Guaranteed to stick in my head for hours every time I listen to it.</p>
<h3 id="i-just-threw-out-the-love-of-my-dreams-1996">I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams (1996)</h3>
<p>A sad / sweet synth rock masterpiece with one of my absolute favourite vocal melodies. Rachel Haden is flawless, and the bridge, with its duet vocal, is perfect. Add in Rivers somehow shredding a synth, and building the whole thing to a soaring finish. Unbeatable.</p>
<h3 id="sheila-can-do-it-1996--2020">Sheila Can Do It (1996 / 2020)</h3>
<p>How about an album track? And a recent one too, just to prove I‚Äôm not an insufferable hipster. For me, this is easily the highlight of Weezer‚Äôs last 15 years. That it‚Äôs core is essentially unchanged from the 1996 demo version probably says something, but I adore this sing-song vocal melody and playful riff. The bridge and chorus are unimpeachable.</p>
<h3 id="listen-up-2001">Listen Up (2001)</h3>
<p>OK, I‚Äôm an insufferable hipster. This is probably one of my favourite songs ever, by any artist, and it‚Äôs a demo from the peak of Rivers‚Äô hyper-productive period around the Green album when every b-side and off-cut was better than what was ending up on other bands‚Äô albums. The dynamics of this song are a marvel to me, and perfectly capture a seemingly effortless knack for imbuing simple pop melodies with aching beauty. So few artists can pull off that trick with any consistency: among them Lennon &amp; McCartney; Brian Wilson; Rivers Cuomo. If you don‚Äôt happen to have the 2001 demo (or BBC live session) lying around, <a href="https://youtu.be/58oC65i-AcI">here‚Äôs a YouTube version</a> ‚Äî¬†enjoy! üéµ</p>

			 <p>In the last couple of years, since spinning up a Gaming division, Netflix has quietly built an enviable portfolio of titles available (at no extra charge)¬†to subscribers. I‚Äôm writing this today because the long-awaited <em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em> has just been released. The developers behind this title (and the original <em>Oxenfree</em>), <a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/">Night School</a>, were one of the first studios to be acquired by Netflix<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, signalling that they were serious about games. I had a great time with the original game when it was released in 2016, and this week I picked up a month of Netflix mainly to play the sequel. Such is the company‚Äôs strategy, presumably: to add to their content release schedule not just new TV shows, but must-play games ‚Äî¬†two parallel tracks via which to gain (and keep) subscribers.</p>
<p>Consider your options if you want to play the new game right now:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢¬†Steam (PC &amp; Mac): ¬£13.49 (25% launch sale, down from ¬£17.99)<br>
‚Ä¢¬†Nintendo Switch: ¬£13.49 (25% launch sale, down from ¬£17.99)<br>
‚Ä¢ PlayStation: ¬£14.24 (25% launch sale, down from ¬£18.99)</p>
<p>Or, you can pick up a month of Netflix (from ¬£4.99), and play the game on your iOS or Android device. Plus, you get to finish season three of <em>Emily in Paris</em>!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a list of a few other games on the service that I would recommend:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢¬†<em>Terra Nil</em> ‚Äî¬†city-builder / strategy<br>
‚Ä¢¬†<em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> ‚Äî¬†truly one-of-a-kind point &amp; click adventure<br>
‚Ä¢¬†<em>Immortality</em> ‚Äî¬†one of my absolute favourite games of 2022<br>
‚Ä¢¬†<em>Spiritfarer</em> ‚Äî¬†sweet, easygoing management-style game<br>
‚Ä¢¬†<em>Into the Breach</em> ‚Äî¬†space-set turn-based strategy<br>
‚Ä¢¬†<em>Moonlighter</em> ‚Äî shop management</p>
<p>And of course, the original <em>Oxenfree</em> ‚Äî¬†spooky adventure with excellent writing.<br>

<p>I‚Äôm not affiliated with Netflix in any way, nor would I accept money from anyone to advertise anything, ever<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But, I do believe in sharing cool things when I find them, and in my experience a lot of people with active Netflix subscriptions don‚Äôt know that they could also be playing excellent games without spending an extra penny. üïπÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>This afternoon, UK-based tech company <a href="https://nothing.tech">Nothing</a> unveiled their second smartphone: Nothing Phone (2).</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/nothing-phone-2.png" alt=""><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/ad76e1ee2464c3417d4339.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Just as with the original model, I <strong>love</strong> the way this thing looks, and I admire the design ethos behind it: to make tech innovative and fun again, in an age when iteration on established design languages has become the necessary, safe bet for the entrenched market leaders.¬†Oh, it‚Äôs also significantly cheaper than an iPhone. Here are the prices at which some flagship devices start:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ iPhone 14: ¬£849<br>
‚Ä¢ iPhone 14 Pro: ¬£1,099<br>
‚Ä¢ Google Pixel 7: ¬£599<br>
‚Ä¢ Google Pixel 7 Pro: ¬£849<br>
‚Ä¢ Nothing Phone (2): ¬£579</p>
<p>I have been an iPhone user since 2011‚Äôs iPhone 4S. Over that decade-plus ‚Äî¬†in which I‚Äôve owned four different models ‚Äî Apple has worked to ensure that the iPhone has increasingly become the centre of a whole ecosystem of devices and services. The upshot of this strategy (and, indeed, the purpose of it), is that there are significant obstacles for anyone considering a move <em>away</em> from Apple‚Äôs phone. As an experiment, I thought I‚Äôd do some thinking about what it would mean for me to make the switch.</p>
<p>As a starting point, let‚Äôs consider each of the apps currently on my iPhone‚Äôs Home Screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/home-screen.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†no Android version is available, but I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of calendar apps that would make a fine substitute. However, I would then need to figure out what calendar apps to use on iPad and Mac. At present Fantastical is syncing the iCloud calendars associated with my Apple ID, so I might even need to find a new solution for that.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong> ‚Äî not a problem; I‚Äôm sure there are good Android weather apps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></strong> ‚Äî there actually <em>is</em> an Android version of Apple‚Äôs music service, so I wouldn‚Äôt need to make a switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†this one‚Äôs easy, as there‚Äôs an Android version.</p>
<p><strong>Reminders</strong> ‚Äî¬†again, there are certainly acceptable substitutes for this in the Play Store, <em>but</em> one of my main uses of Reminders is for shopping lists shared with my partner. It works seamlessly because our Apple IDs are associated as a family. Getting the same functionality elsewhere would be relatively easy, but would require asking my partner to download a different app ‚Äî¬†annoying.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></strong> ‚Äî no Android version is available, and that‚Äôs a significant issue. I‚Äôve used Cultured Code‚Äôs task manager to pretty much run my life since January 2010<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It‚Äôs an essential part of how I think about organising things, and I use it everywhere: Mac, iPad, &amp; Apple Watch, but <em>primarily</em> iPhone. Moving away from it would be tricky. My second choice ‚Äî OmniFocus ‚Äî¬†also doesn‚Äôt have an Android version. I‚Äôd have to resort to something like Todoist, which would also incur a paid subscription (unlike Things).</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong> ‚Äî¬†another strong argument for iCloud‚Äôs flawless syncing between devices. I‚Äôve been using these things long enough to remember when every photo I took on my phone <em>didn‚Äôt</em> automatically appear on all my other devices. But I‚Äôm absolutely spoiled by it now, and I don‚Äôt want to go back to the days of using middle-man services (eg. syncing to Google Photos, and bridging that to iCloud?) to make sure everything‚Äôs available everywhere.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://hey.com">HEY</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†another easy one: there‚Äôs an Android version of my email client.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> ‚Äî¬†ah, the <a href="https://youtu.be/BuaKzm7Kq9Q">blue bubble vs green bubble</a> dilemma! Amongst friends and family, iMessage is by far my most commonly used messaging platform. Yes, between WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, &amp; SMS, there are plenty of other options, but the inconvenience of a move away from iMessage isn‚Äôt to be underestimated.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://thebrowser.company/">Arc</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†not a huge loss at present, and perhaps The Browser Company will eventually bring this to Android.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†another cross-platform win: an Android version of this journalling app is available.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†there‚Äôs no Android version of my preferred Mastodon client, and indeed the options look very limited. I‚Äôd probably have to switch back to the official app, which is fine, but not a patch on Ivory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://getmatter.com">Matter</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†my read-it-later service of choice doesn‚Äôt have an Android app, so I‚Äôd have to switch away from it to an alternative, like Instapaper, Pocket, or Readwise. I don‚Äôt do a lot of the actual <em>reading</em> on iPhone though<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, so perhaps I could figure out an alternative method of saving items into Matter on the phone, one option being via email.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†a first class Android version of this blogging application is available!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://marcosatanaka.com/">MusicBox</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Marcos Tanaka‚Äôs music tracking app has become an important part of my listening experience. The fact that no Android version is available would put a major kink in my daily work towards compiling my <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/thelists">end of year list</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Similar to Matter (above), my feed-reader of choice (since 2009) is also not available on Android. Again, most of the actual reading gets done elsewhere (iPad &amp; Mac), but I‚Äôm not discounting the annoyance of having one device missing from that setup.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sonos.com">Sonos</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†no issues here: the controller for my home audio system is available on Android.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://threads.net">Threads</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Meta‚Äôs new microblogging platform is by no means an essential part of my digital life, and surely headed to Android in the near future<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong> ‚Äî¬†I like Safari‚Äôs privacy-first approach, but I don‚Äôt use any of its syncing features (largely because I use Arc as my browser of choice on Mac). Switching to Firefox or something similar on Android wouldn‚Äôt be a major pain point.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†luckily my preferred password manager is available everywhere, otherwise this would have been a deal-breaker.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†I‚Äôm not married to one particular note-taking application, and I could find something that would work across platforms; perhaps even something with a web / browser version, which would be nice.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†this simple scratchpad is an excellent example of a little application that I use all the time, and which relies entirely upon instant iCloud syncing. I <em>could</em> live without it, but I‚Äôd prefer not to!</p>
<p>Looking past the first page, the other stumbling blocks that I can foresee are largely tied to Apple‚Äôs own software &amp; services.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ I use FaceTime with family, all of whom <em>could</em> be persuaded to use a platform agnostic alternative, but why should they change their setups for me?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ I use Apple Fitness+ quite a bit, and replacements a) tend to be more expensive, &amp; b) won‚Äôt integrate perfectly with my Apple Watch.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ Contacts and Wallet both have native Android allegories, but that would mean managing data in both places: eg. adding or updating a contact on both iOS and Android.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ There are a lot of little ecosystem touches that would break if I had a non-Apple phone: eg. using the phone keyboard, and auto-filling passwords on Apple TV (much easier than navigating an onscreen keyboard with a remote); setting alarms (and choosing music for them) on my HomePod. In both cases I <em>could</em> pull out the iPad each time, but it‚Äôs not ideal.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ Not a huge deal, but I also have a case, a MagSafe Wallet, and a MagSafe charger, all of which are highly likely to be compatible with the next iPhone, and are all incompatible with non-Apple options</p>
<hr>
<p>In short, switching away from iPhone to an Android device would incur a dozen or so penalties ranging from irksome to genuinely annoying. The penalties for staying <em>with</em> iPhone, of course, are twofold:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ No choice as to which operating system you use: you just have what Apple gives you. <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/">iOS 17</a> looks just fine, and has some neat additions, <em>but</em> it is clearly another iteration (and a relatively modest one) on the same design that has persisted since iOS 7 debuted a <strong>decade</strong> ago. Variety is one of Android‚Äôs selling points, and Nothing‚Äôs OS (for example) has a distinct look that feels genuinely new.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
‚Ä¢ A ~¬£300 premium on each upgrade. As mentioned, I‚Äôve had four iPhones in 12 years, or an upgrade roughly every three years. If the difference between an iPhone and a perfectly capable Android device is ¬£300 each time, that adds up.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I have mixed feelings about all of this, is that I‚Äôm the same person who was, <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html">not so long ago</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, espousing the virtues of not tying oneself into centralised social platforms ‚Äî¬†of operating independent of any one company‚Äôs choices over your experience. And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I‚Äôve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, <em>of course</em> I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem work together. But I‚Äôm not going to pretend there isn‚Äôt a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/07/twoway-mirrors-at.html">Two-way Mirrors at the Mall</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zioibi.com/2023/07/07/twoway-mirrors-at.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-07 14:20:34 &#43;0100">Jul 7, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I forget where now, but one of the most insightful characterisations of centralised social networks that I‚Äôve encountered, is the idea that a few companies tricked everyone into hanging out at the mall. There‚Äôs arguably a flaw in the premise of the oft-quoted idea of a singular ‚Äòdigital town square for the world‚Äô, but if you were to picture a truly <strong>social</strong> space at that magnitude, it likely wouldn‚Äôt have billboards strewn throughout it. The conversations wouldn‚Äôt be monopolised by attention-seeking celebrities. And you certainly wouldn‚Äôt invite weirdly anthropomorphised incarnations of innumerable brands to join the party.</p>
<p>All of these things were normalised over years of Twitter &amp; Instagram‚Äôs dominance of the social media sphere. Spaces that were ostensibly for people to share their experiences and have conversations, came to include ‚Äî¬†and arguably to be characterised by ‚Äî¬†the contributions of others who had alternative motives: commonly to garner attention, and/or to sell something. Instead of <em>communication</em>, these platforms became about <em>broadcast</em>.</p>
<p>After 24 hours playing with Meta‚Äôs new microblogging platform ‚Äî¬†Threads ‚Äî¬†I‚Äôm struck by the extent to which, for all the tsuris in the social media space of late, this established paradigm persists. The platform <em>only</em> has an algorithmically-generated Home feed at present<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and whilst this will likely change, it currently plays as a very open admission from Meta that this isn‚Äôt designed as a purely social platform. Like latter day Twitter before it ‚Äî and like its visual-first sister platform, Instagram ‚Äî Threads is <em>already</em> a place where, yes, you <em>can</em> share your experiences, and socialise with friends, <em>but</em> you do so whilst surrounded by people who eagerly want your attention and your money. This is the promise and the peril of the centralised platform: <em><strong>everyone‚Äôs here</strong></em> (but that includes the try-hard brands, and the thirsty celebrities). So, yes, it already feels a little icky, and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuW5-eWL34x/">the advertisers aren‚Äôt even there yet</a>. But ‚Äî <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html">as predicted</a> ‚Äî¬† the new platform immediately allowed me to reconnected with some folks who never would have made their way to Mastodon. The colossal power of Instagram‚Äôs established social graph did its thing, and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuX691ePVBZ/">48 million Threads accounts were activated in the first ~24 hours</a>. By most estimates, that‚Äôs something like <em>four times</em> the size of every combined Mastodon instance, on day one!<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether by design or circumstance, Threads‚Äô much-lauded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> integration isn‚Äôt available at launch. At present it is very much a walled-garden proudly professing its ambitions of federation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But, overnight, it has become one of the largest entities committed to using the protocol<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and its eventual federation will have consequences for the ActivityPub ecosystem that I don‚Äôt think are entirely clear at present. In my experience, reception to the idea on Mastodon has been mixed. Some server admins have pledged to de-federate Threads as soon as it integrates with the protocol; others (including <a href="https://omglol.news/2023/06/28/meta-the-fediverse-and-omg-lol">the admin of my server</a>) have a more balanced view. There have been enough questions floating around, that Mastodon-founder / lead developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gargron">Eugen Rochko</a> published <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/">some notes</a>, seeking to allay fears about Meta‚Äôs ability to track Mastodon users, and push adverts to Mastodon servers etc. His conclusion is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been advocating for interoperability between platforms for years. The biggest hurdle to users switching platforms when those platforms become exploitative is the lock-in of the social graph, the fact that switching platforms means abandoning everyone you know and who knows you. The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media, but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers. Which in turn, puts pressure on such platforms to provide better, less exploitative services. This is a clear victory for our cause, hopefully one of many to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst there are many unknowns about how all this plays out, I think there‚Äôs a good chance that the advent of Threads will redound to the benefit of the social web writ large. Advocates of open protocols like ActivityPub should be optimistic about the arrival of a platform that is already clearly on a path to mass adoption. Whether it‚Äôs in weeks‚Äô or months‚Äô time, there will soon be millions more accounts available to follow, almost certainly including people whose posts you will be interested in, but whom would not otherwise have joined a compatible platform. But the best part is, you won‚Äôt need to step foot in the mall to follow them. Whatever the Threads experience ultimately becomes, thanks to ActivityPub integration, the option will exist to follow Threads accounts without having to engage with an algorithmically-generated Home feed full of brands and celebrities, without ever having to see an advert, and without giving the surveillance capitalism vampires any more of your data.</p>
<p>Personally, I intend to keep playing around with Threads for now. Likely as soon as it‚Äôs possible, however, I‚Äôll switch to following Threads users via Mastodon. It will be interesting to see how easy or difficult Meta make it for Threads users to find and follow non-Threads sources publishing via ActivityPub. That barrier, whilst it‚Äôll almost certainly be bidirectional, may well involve jumping through some cumbersome hoops not-so-subtly designed to keep people on Meta‚Äôs platform. I think I‚Äôll be OK with that. If it leads to a kind of two-way mirror effect, where I can follow Threads users‚Äô posts, but it‚Äôs harder for them to find mine‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs arguably a win-win.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôm hearing the verb ‚Äúto bagel‚Äù used more in Wimbledon commentary this year, meaning to beat an opponent in a set, without losing a game.</p>
<p>In principle it‚Äôs quite fun, <em>but</em> it undermines my favourite ‚Äî though likely apocryphal ‚Äî explanation for where the term ‚ÄúLove‚Äù comes from in tennis: that it‚Äôs a malapropism of the French, ‚Äúl‚Äô≈ìuf‚Äù: the egg.</p>

			 <p>Hey, are you on Splooter? Did you start a Bomblo account?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Social media in the era of Twitter&rsquo;s (ongoing) collapse is truly wild. Me? I have accounts all over the place: <a href="https://social.lol/@zioibi">Mastodon</a> (as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before), but also Bluesky, Cohost, T2, Post&hellip; and probably more that I&rsquo;m forgetting. There&rsquo;s life out there, to varying degrees, and it&rsquo;s been fun keeping an eye on how things are evolving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always keep my own site; it&rsquo;s too important to the way I feel about the web for me not to have a spot that&rsquo;s all my own, and subject to no on else&rsquo;s decision making. No adverts, no cookies, no analytics, and full control over everything I publish. I&rsquo;d encourage anyone who values what they&rsquo;re posting online to  think about adopting the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> mindset: &lsquo;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But the social web has its place too, and right now I feel a little as though I&rsquo;m still looking for a perfect fit.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢¬†<strong>Twitter</strong> is increasingly a far-right cesspool, and its server architecture seems to be actively on fire.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢¬†My impression of <strong>Bluesky</strong> has been that it seems chock full of people trying desperately to be funny all the time, which can be exhausting.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ I dig my <strong>Mastodon</strong> experience, but it‚Äôs super niche: mainly people talking about open-source projects, blogging, and the fediverse.</p>
<p>Today, Meta launched their microblogging platform: <a href="https://threads.net"><strong>Threads</strong></a>, and it feels like it has a genuine chance at mass adoption. Leveraging users' already established Instagram social graph gives it a significant jump start. It&rsquo;s super early, and the v1 released a few hours ago is missing features that may be considered basic (eg. a timeline of accounts you&rsquo;re following; a browser-based interface; hashtags; availability in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EU<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!), but it feels like there&rsquo;s a chance it could provide a place for people to just post about brunch again.</p>
<p>Put another way: a lot of the family, friends, and accounts I previously followed on Twitter were <em>never</em> going to make the jump to Mastodon, but the majority of them already have Instagram accounts, which puts them a click away from Threads. I expect to see a lot of them there fairly soon. If you&rsquo;re also there, <a href="https://threads.net/@zioibi">say hi</a>!</p>

			 <p>Newslettering godfather Craig Mod is currently running a limited time pop-up ‚Äî <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/165/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>BASIE!BOP!JAMAICA!</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> ‚Äî¬†chronicling his visits to several jazz kissa<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in northern Japan. As with everything he publishes, the mix of detail-oriented observation, humane context, and thoughtful rumination is pitch perfect. Here&rsquo;s a clipping from the latest issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mizuyama tells me how he listens to records: Twenty times, he says standing in the shadows, sipping his fourth whiskey on the rocks, toking his hand-rolled cigarettes. That‚Äôs my minimum. Even if I hate the record, I listen to it twenty times. Really listen. Try to understand it. Try to understand what I don‚Äôt like about it if I don‚Äôt like it. Try to get, truly, what those musicians were saying.</p>
<p>[‚Ä¶]</p>
<p>He says, Look ‚Äî¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->music doesn‚Äôt change. The music on the album doesn‚Äôt change.¬†<em>You</em>¬†change. So if you don‚Äôt like it today, maybe you‚Äôll like it tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The onus, he‚Äôs saying, is on the listener to reach across the aisle, to consider maybe¬†<em>they</em>¬†got it wrong, to push and pull on the scope of their taste like wet dough until you at least understand, if not love, the art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also love Mod&rsquo;s photo of Mizuyama Kazutsugu‚Äôs kissa, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vu42DJsFF5XtvyidA">Jazz Spot Leaf</a></p>

			 <p>We‚Äôre now half way through the year, and it‚Äôs tempting to pull together a list of my favourite 2023 records to date&hellip; but I think I‚Äôll save that until the <a href="/thelists">end of year list</a>. Instead, here are my favourite ten album covers from the first six months of the year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="10-superviolet-infinite-spring">10. Superviolet ‚Äî¬†<em>Infinite Spring</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/superviolet.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not 100% sure about the typeface here, though it‚Äôs not distracting. I just love the skyscape ‚Äî which reminds me of <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/2018/06/21/010000.html">long Icelandic summer sunsets</a> ‚Äî¬†and the use of the moon as a kind of punctuation mark.</p>
<h3 id="9-mandy-indiana-ive-seen-a-way">9. Mandy, Indiana ‚Äî¬†<em>I‚Äôve Seen a Way</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/mandy-indiana.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At once busy and static ‚Äî I like the ways in which the sunlight, and the water, bring life to the squared off forms of the walls.</p>
<h3 id="8-nappy-nina-mourning-due">8. Nappy Nina ‚Äî¬†<em>Mourning Due</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/nappy-nina.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A little on the nose perhaps, given the artist‚Äôs name, but this makes me smile every time I see it. I appreciate the effort put into the elegant execution of a simple visual joke.</p>
<h3 id="7-albert-hammond-jr-melodies-on-hiatus">7. Albert Hammond Jr. ‚Äî¬†<em>Melodies on Hiatus</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/albert.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been a sucker for Helvetica for a long, long time, and it hasn&rsquo;t stopped working for me yet. I like the balance of bold feature typeface and an abstract background.</p>
<h3 id="6-militarie-gun-life-under-the-gun">6. Militarie Gun ‚Äî¬†<em>Life Under the Gun</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/militarie-gun.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I like the painterly qualities of this, and the choice to make it a direct overhead vantage. With the human figures‚Äô shadows, it has something of <a href="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/muse.png">Muse‚Äôs <em>Absolution</em></a> (2003) about it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="5-unknown-mortal-orchestra-v">5. Unknown Mortal Orchestra ‚Äî¬†<em>V</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/umo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I have no idea of the story behind this photo, but the combination of an active, arresting image with the simple rendering of the album‚Äôs title works superbly.</p>
<h3 id="4-kelela-raven">4. Kelela ‚Äî¬†<em>Raven</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/kelela.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Kelela has a history of strikingly posed record covers, but I think this simple black &amp; white composition is perhaps the best yet. You can almost feel the subtle, living motion in it.</p>
<h3 id="3-lia-kohl-the-ceiling-reposes">3. Lia Kohl ‚Äî¬†<em>The Ceiling Reposes</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/lia-kohl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I love the dark blue on grey, the repeated circular form, the choice to obscure part of the photographed image, and the textured grain effect. The thin, cleaner border really makes it.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-japanese-house-in-the-end-it-always-does">2. The Japanese House ‚Äî¬†<em>In The End it Always Does</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/the-japanese-house.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A similar colour palette to the Lia Kohl (above), and a similar use of subtle whitespace. The imperfection and texture of the hand-drawn arrow has a wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a> character, and I love everything about the simple type treatment, aligned at the right margin.</p>
<h3 id="1-boygenius-the-record">1. Boygenius ‚Äî¬†<em>The Record</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/boygenius.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôm tipping my cards a little here, but this is one of those album covers that has the magical property of <em>feeling</em> like the record <em>sounds</em>. In a beautifully simple image, it evokes warmth and friendship, whilst manifesting the music‚Äôs sense of reaching for something.</p>

			 <p>Last night I rewatched David O Russell‚Äôs <em>Amsterdam</em> (2022). It‚Äôs the director‚Äôs loosest-feeling movie since 2004‚Äôs <em>I Heart Huckabees</em>, and I really enjoy the pace at which it moves. There is a gentle, consistent ease with which it trips the traps of its plot, and ushers in one guest star after another. Unlike some mystery movies, which feel as though they‚Äôre going out of their way to prove the cleverness of their plot, <em>Amsterdam</em> is content simply to let its central knot unwind at a slow, gentle pull. Instead the focus is on the relationships between the central trio: a little cluster of characters imbued ‚Äî¬†by Bale, Robbie, &amp; Washington ‚Äî¬†with just the right level of quirk as to remain endearing throughout the 134 minute run time.</p>
<p>Special mention should be made of Emmanuel Lubezki‚Äôs cinematography. His work has dazzled me in the past: the gritty urgency of Alfonso Cuar√≥n‚Äôs <em>Children of Men</em> (2006), and the captivating ballet of the same director‚Äôs <em>Gravity</em> (2013); the breadth of <em>The Revenant</em> (2015), and the bravura ‚Äúsingle-take‚Äù work on <em>Birdman</em> (2014) both with Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu. Here, in <em>Amsterdam</em>, he employs a palette of greens, browns, and oranges that give the whole film a lush richness. In the few scenes in which they are missing, their omission is as shocking as any plot twist. üçø</p>

			 <p>Today we ventured out to Whitstable and Herne Bay, to breathe sea air, and walk the coast a little<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We had coffee in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffeeblueprint/">Blueprint</a>; walked the cute little back streets; a darting sparrow flew between my legs; we ate fish &amp; chips at a place on the seafront.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I enjoy the difference between the two towns. Whitstable is very much a place where Blueprint ‚Äî a small batch roastery that is also a tiny bookshop, and stocks a curated collection of Japanese stationery and Blackwing pencils ‚Äî¬†feels correctly situated. It‚Äôs a place of indie bookshops, cute little florists, and artisanal cheesemongers. Herne Bay (only 9km up the road) feels far closer to a traditional English seaside town: greasy spoon cafes, a pier, seagulls making a play for your ice cream cone.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader; always have been. And as someone who <em>loves</em> to read, and who chose to pursue <a href="/essays">degrees in literature</a>, I&rsquo;ve long had mixed feelings about the deliberateness with which I&rsquo;ve found that I need to approach texts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I reflected on this again recently, as I read a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/remembering-robert-gottlieb-editor-extraordinaire">profile of the late Robert Gottlieb</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gottlieb was a showoff, but not of the athletic sort. When he was in high school, he read ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù in ‚Äúa single marathon fourteen-hour session.‚Äù As an undergraduate, at Columbia, he read Proust: ‚Äúseven volumes, seven days.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking the latter of those first, the task of making one&rsquo;s way through <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> in a week, means reading about 181,000 words per day, for seven days straight. That pace is <em>way</em> beyond my reach, even for a single day! I once read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> in one day: it&rsquo;s 73,404 words, and left little time for anything else.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s turning to the <em>War and Peace</em> claim that really makes me question whether this story about Gottlieb is apocryphal. Tolstoy&rsquo;s opus is 587,287 words. To read it in a 14 hour sitting as claimed, you&rsquo;d have to go at a little under 42,000 words per hour, or 700 words per minute, non-stop, for 840 minutes.</p>
<p>It brought to mind that quote, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/08/speed-reading/">usually attributed to Woody Allen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took a speed-reading course and read <em>War and Peace</em> in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst searching for that, I found a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/opinion/l-war-and-peace-in-20-minutes-if-you-care-what-it-says-read-449395.html">1995 letter to the Editor of the NY Times</a>, from communications consultant Dr Phyllis Mindell, in which she decries the practice of &lsquo;speed reading&rsquo;. Here are a couple of sections that chimed for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study after study demonstrates that although people can skim at extremely high rates (as much as 100,000 words a minute), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they gain substantially no comprehension<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly my experience: fly through the text and I end up with no significant understanding of it. Perhaps because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[F]ailure must result from any method that assumes that reading is primarily a visual task<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that one can &ldquo;take in whole pages at a single glance,&rdquo; [&hellip;] or that the approach to reading remains independent of the content of the material to be read or the purposes of reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading is a practice of comprehension, conducted only at first with the eyes, and then primarily with that miraculous organ directly behind them. The letter quotes a wonderful phrasing of this task, by Stanley Elkin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most trenchant critiques of &ldquo;speed reading&rdquo; emerge, directly or indirectly, from the strongest readers. The writer Stanley Elkin, for example, called reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;fine, precise, detailed work, the infinitely small motor managements of diamond cutters and safecrackers that we do in our heads.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as people who think they&rsquo;re multi-tasking are more likely doing several things poorly, I remain convinced that &lsquo;speed readers&rsquo; are actually just looking at patterns, and not engaged in the act of comprehension that I understand reading to be. üìö<br>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It is certainly not my intention here to besmirch the good name of the late Robert Gottlieb, may he rest in peace.</p>

			 <p>In 2014, I started a summer read-along project as a way to (essentially) peer pressure myself into finally completing David Foster Wallace‚Äôs giant-sized novel <em>Infinite Jest</em> (1996). I assembled a small group of like-minded readers, and we had a good time reading the book together and sharing our thoughts. Each weekend I sent out an email newsletter, with notes on the week‚Äôs reading.</p>
<p>The read-along has now become an annual summer tradition: a growing group of readers take on a lengthy novel together, and I send out a newsletter each Sunday discussing our progress. So far we‚Äôve read eight novels together, and you can browse the <a href="https://zioibi.com/si">archive of those newsletters right here</a>.</p>
<p>The time has now come to start the ball rolling on this summer‚Äôs read-along, which I‚Äôll be running between <strong>2 Jul ‚Äì 13 Aug 2023</strong>. When it came to choosing a novel this year, I did a lot of digging around the dark corners of back alley bookshops, browsing the fat, dusty spines of long-forgotten esoteric tomes‚Ä¶ and then I chose the novel that won <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/barbara-kingsolver">the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</a>: Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs <em>Demon Copperhead</em> (2022).</p>
<p><img src="https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/4df69f5bca.png" alt="A banner announcing that volume nine of the Sipped Ink read-along will begin on 2 July 2023, and cover Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs novel Demon Copperhead."></p>
<p>This transplanting of Dickens‚Äô <em>David Copperfield</em> (1850) to modern-day Virginia has been called ‚Äòa masterpiece in storytelling‚Äô and ‚Äòa once-in-a-generation novel that breaks and mends your heart in the way only the best fiction can‚Äô. Sounds pretty good, right?</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to learn more about the novel, you could take a look at <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/product/9780571376483-demon-copperhead/">the publisher‚Äôs website</a>. As-and-when you‚Äôre excited to sign up for this summer‚Äôs read-along, <a href="mailto:readalong@zioibi.com?subject=Sign%20me%20up%20for%20Sipped%20Ink%20vol%209&amp;body=Adam%2C%20count%20me%20in%20for%20reading%20Demon%20Copperhead.%20">click right here</a> and send the resulting email.</p>
<p>As always, the read-along itself is completely free; the only thing you‚Äôll need is a copy of the book. If you would like to order the paperback, one great option is Bookshop.org ‚Äî¬†and if you use <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/7952/9780571376483">this link right here</a> I‚Äôll get a little commission, at no extra cost to you!</p>
<p>At 546 pages, it‚Äôs the lowest page count for a read-along novel yet, <em>but</em> the good folks at Faber have chosen a font size for the paperback that‚Äôs a little on the small side, so I think ‚Äî in terms of word count ‚Äî it‚Äôs probably similar to <em>Great Circle</em>, or even Murakami‚Äôs <em>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</em>, which we read together in 2015.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send out an introductory email to subscribers on <strong>Sun 2 Jul</strong>, and the following weekend an email will arrive on <strong>Sun 9 Jul</strong>, discussing the first 91 pages of the novel. We‚Äôll be reading at about that pace for six weeks, wrapping up on <strong>Sun 13 Aug</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have any comments or questions about any of this, just <a href="mailto:readalong@zioibi.com">drop me a line</a>. üìö</p>

			 <p>Since I last posted I&rsquo;ve read a couple of books, both of them a little disappointing, but by no means without merit:</p>
<p>The first was Gabrielle Zevin&rsquo;s much-hyped <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> (2022), which I found both frustratingly divorced from the practical realities of the video game industry (in which it is set), and too eager to undermine its female lead by placing her into romantic relationships with virtually every male character in the novel.</p>
<p>The second was Nell Zink&rsquo;s <em>Avalon</em> (2022), which is dense with ideas, but I found the through-lines of its characters to be too faintly pencilled. It&rsquo;s not so much that I was clamouring for capital C, capital D: Character Development ‚Äî¬†but in a novel centred around a young woman moving through various upheavals in life circumstance, I felt something a little lacking. Perhaps I just wanted to close the novel with a more definite sense of Bran having learned something about herself. Equally, perhaps that was not Zink&rsquo;s project, and she remains an unquestionably fine, endlessly interesting writer.</p>
<p>I also caught a clutch of good movies; let me bullet point them for you:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>The Fabelmans</em> (2022) ‚Äî¬†catnip for those cinephiles for whom Spielberg has been a constant presence since childhood</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>Women Talking</em> (2022) ‚Äî masterful in every regard</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>Men</em> (2022) ‚Äî¬†Alex Garland&rsquo;s weirdest, with a truly outr√© last reel</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>Certain Women</em> (2016) ‚Äî¬†a rewatch of this favourite on International Women&rsquo;s Day; Kelly Reichardt can do no wrong</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>Wheel of Fortune &amp; Fantasy</em> (2021) ‚Äî¬†almost the equal of Ryusuke Hamaguchi&rsquo;s other 2021 film: Oscar-winner, <em>Drive My Car</em></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>Empire of Light</em> (2022) ‚Äî I think I need more room for this one, and may write about it in <a href="/newsletter">the newsletter</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em>A Human Position</em> (2022) ‚Äî¬†I loved the pace of this, and the pride it takes lingering on both Norway&rsquo;s natural beauty, and its objects of design.</p>

<p>Another month is at an end, and whilst I‚Äôm not committed to doing this every time, it did cross my mind to drop a ‚Äòfavourite record of February‚Äô post<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This time around, I feel as though I need to split the honours between a pair of albums: Paramore‚Äôs <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1646945378"><em>This Is Why</em></a>, and Screaming Females‚Äô <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1644825845"><em>Desire Pathway</em></a>. I‚Äôve listened to each of them a bunch since they came out, and both albums have proven to be hugely welcome returns after 5+ year breaks.</p>
<p>Other notable February releases for me:</p>
<p>Black Belt Eagle Scout ‚Äî¬†<em>The Land, The Water, The Sky</em><br>
Hope D ‚Äî¬†<em>Clash of the Substance</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><br>
Kelela ‚Äî¬†<em>Raven</em><br>
Caroline Polacheck ‚Äî¬†<em>Desire, I Want to Turn Into You</em><br>
Hania Rani ‚Äî¬†<em>On Giacometti</em><br>
The WAEVE ‚Äî¬†<em>The WAEVE</em><br>
WILSN ‚Äî¬†<em>Those Days Are Over</em><br>

			 <p>I‚Äôm an inveterate highlighter, firmly established in the practice of scribbling down and squirrelling away those phrases and ideas I come across that send a certain type of vibration through me. Recently, I was doing some digital housekeeping and found a trove of older notes, many of which contained snippets I hadn‚Äôt thought about in many years, but which shone for me once more upon re-discovering them.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun ‚Äî and possibly of value ‚Äî to share some of these clippings, and since I‚Äôm also starting to think about bringing my newsletter out of hibernation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I figured that might make a good venue. I&rsquo;ll drop a quote / highlight into future issues, with or without my own commentary as seems appropriate.</p>
<p>As a trial,¬†here‚Äôs a framing of the practice of blogging that I like, from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hello-by-the-way-whatever_b_17745">this 2011 piece in <em>Huffpost</em></a>, by Nora Ephron:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most delicious things about the profoundly parasitical world of blogs is that you don‚Äôt have to have anything much to say. Or you just have to have a little tiny thing to say. You just might want to say hello. I‚Äôm here. And by the way. On the other hand. Nevertheless. Did you see this? Whatever. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A blog is sort of like an exhale.

			 <p><img src="/uploads/2023/ce93c0bc33.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Last night I caught a performance by London-based genre-dismantlers <a href="https://jockstrapmusic.com">Jockstrap</a> at The Bullingdon, on Oxford&rsquo;s Cowley Rd. It&rsquo;s a 400-capacity venue that I&rsquo;ve been to for a few shows, but this was the first time I&rsquo;ve seen it packed. The band&rsquo;s current (sold out) tour, in support of debut album <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1625455552"><em>I Love You Jennifer B</em></a> (2022), is also taking them as far afield as Australia &amp; Japan ‚Äî¬†a further sign that their frenetic, adventurous sound has struck a nerve.</p>
<p>The set list was probably about as balanced as Jockstrap can get, pulling from both the softer side of their oeuvre ‚Äî¬†songs like the pretty &amp; sad <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625456136">&lsquo;Glasgow&rsquo;</a>, which Georgia Ellery sings and strums largely solo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ‚Äî to the down-right unstable (see eg. <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1506237863">&lsquo;Robert&rsquo;</a>). Most tracks, however, are some mix of styles: the band shifting restlessly between vibes and valences (ie. the danceable middle third of single &lsquo;Concrete Over Water&rsquo;, a song that is otherwise something approaching a ballad).</p>
<p>One aspect of the sequencing that I really enjoyed, is the way in which following &lsquo;Concrete Over Water&rsquo; (2022) with <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1506237868">&lsquo;The City&rsquo;</a> (2020) makes the earlier track read as a neat coda to the more recent one.</p>
<p><a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625455889">&lsquo;Angst&rsquo;</a> is a three-minute song on the album that sounds as though it was recorded as a four-minute song, and then had its last quarter compressed into the track&rsquo;s final ~25 seconds. The effect is similar to that of scrubbing through those final moments of audio, and I would have guessed that it would be achieved live by employing a sample. It was a delight to see Ellery sing it, whilst Taylor Skye pitch-shifted her vocal.</p>
<p>The whole performance was admirably tight, and you could tell the spell was working: the crowd unfailingly remained silent throughout the quieter moments, and exploded into motion on the high-energy songs. Personal favourite <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625455895">&lsquo;Debra&rsquo;</a> felt like it landed particularly well.</p>
<p>Finally, what a joy it must be to know you&rsquo;ve got a bona fide banger like <a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1625456147">&lsquo;50/50&rsquo;</a> in your back pocket to drop as a closer. Even though <a href="https://youtu.be/cd_MFQIh2zE">the (no budget) official video</a> could have been shot at last night&rsquo;s show, it only goes some way to depicting how much harder the song hits in person.<br>

<p>Re-listening to <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em> ahead of the show (and again this morning) I&rsquo;m experiencing a little regret that I didn&rsquo;t find a spot for it on my <a href="/list2022">end of year top 20</a>. It was one of a few records that made a shortlist, but not the final cut. It&rsquo;s testament to Jockstrap that the live show injects even more vitality to these already super-vibrant songs, and has me second guessing myself.</p>

			 <p>Some bullets from my morning:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ I enjoyed my first spin of the <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1646945378">new Paramore LP</a>, and added a bunch of other records to the queue.</p>

			 <p>Now that we‚Äôre getting Game Boy Advance games on Nintendo Switch Online, here‚Äôs my wishlist.</p>
<p>First, we need to note that amongst the launch line-up are <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</em>, both of which would have been on my list. As would <em>F-Zero Maximum Velocity</em> &amp; <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, which have been announced as forthcoming. And one more caveat: given that the Switch remake ‚Äî <em>Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp</em> ‚Äî now has a new release date (21 Apr), it feels unlikely that the two original games will be added to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NSO<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I guess you never know.</p>
<p>With all that said, here are the top five further additions I‚Äôd love to see:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> ‚Äî <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em><br>
<strong>2</strong> ‚Äî <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em><br>
<strong>3</strong> ‚Äî <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em><br>
<strong>4</strong> ‚Äî <em>Sonic Advance</em><br>
<strong>5</strong> ‚Äî <em>DK: King of Swing</em></p>

<p>Fireworks ‚Äî <em>Higher Lonely Power</em><br>

<p>I am super excited to jump into <a href="https://www.play-season.com/"><em>Season: A Letter to the Future</em></a> (from Scavengers Studio) when it releases on PlayStation in a few hours' time. I&rsquo;ve intentionally avoided pretty much all coverage since first seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/ZCMHnKpt4IM">the announcement trailer</a>, and being instantly certain this was going to be one for me. A chill game about exploring a beautiful world, and collating its stories? Sign me up!</p>

			 <p>Over the last five seasons, for pretty much every game of baseball that I watched, you&rsquo;d find me wearing a replica <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heywaja01.shtml">Jason Heyward</a> jersey. A <em>lot</em> has been written during that period about the wisdom of Heyward&rsquo;s contract with the Cubs (eight years; $184M), and I don&rsquo;t aim to add to it here. At his best, I always found Heyward a magnetic player to watch. His <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/heyward-s-walk-off-grand-slam-c2126932683?q=BatterId%20%3D%20%5B518792%5D%20AND%20HitResult%20%3D%20%5B%22Home%20Run%22%5D%20Order%20By%20Timestamp%20DESC&amp;cp=MIXED&amp;p=1">game-winning walk-off grand slam</a> against the Phillies in 2018 is something I&rsquo;ll never forget, and there are plenty of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/jason-heyward-homers-6-on-a-fly-ball-to-left-field?q=BatterId%20%3D%20%5B518792%5D%20AND%20HitResult%20%3D%20%5B%22Home%20Run%22%5D%20Order%20By%20Timestamp%20DESC&amp;cp=MIXED&amp;p=0">other highlights</a>. Not to mention the consistently <a href="https://youtu.be/NKxkwI8-wA8">stunning defence</a> that won him no fewer than five gold gloves, and the fact that he seems to be a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/jason-heyward-named-cubs-robert-clemente-award-nominee">genuinely wonderful person</a> away from the diamond.</p>
<p>The Cubs having released him in November, I&rsquo;m sure <a href="https://youtu.be/d6-3KLVIqKE">going to miss the guy</a> this coming season.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/058e08782b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Heyward&rsquo;s departure sent me shopping for a new jersey. One consideration is longevity: no one wants to drop money on a shirt, only to find the player has been traded away from the club a season later. Following that logic, I might have picked up a jersey that read <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/suzukse01.shtml">SUZUKI</a> #27<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (signed through 2026), or even <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/swansda01.shtml">SWANSON</a> #7<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (signed through 2029). In the end, however, I went a different direction. When you happen to share a surname with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/woodke02.shtml">one of your team&rsquo;s legends</a>, sometimes you have to lean into it!</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2023/d3a3e7ce12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I could not be more excited to wear this <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-cardinals/2023/06/25/717623">at London Stadium this summer</a>, rooting for the Cubbies in person, for the first time!</p>

			 <p>For my birthday last week, I successfully dropped sufficient hints to my partner such that I was gifted this Lego set: the helpful explorer droid <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BD-1">BD-1</a>, from the <em>Star Wars</em> video game <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em> (2021) (and its soon-to-be-released sequel).</p>
<p>It has been an unalloyed pleasure to piece this little guy together. I put a few episodes of <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> on in the background, and studied the instruction booklet as though it contained the secret to eternal life.</p>
