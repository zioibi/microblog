I do not hold out much hope that this new album will have similar impact. 🎵\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/img-8934.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"2910\" alt=\"\">\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Last night I went to see <a href=\"https://boxd.it/xX9c\"><em>Passages</em> (2023)</a>, a beautifully-shot love triangle tragedy set in Paris. The mechanism of the film is essentially the central character making a series of selfish, ego-driven decisions (or, more accurately, acting on his own desires without much consideration). Those around him — and principally those with whom he&rsquo;s romantically involved — are seen struggling with the profound repercussions. As the third act arrives, you&rsquo;re desperate for other characters to finally draw a line, and call him out. Judging from overheard conversation during the credits, some people in the audience struggled with the protagonist&rsquo;s lack of development. It&rsquo;s certainly frustrating, but I found it to be an accurate portrayal of narcissism: people like Tomas (Franz Rogowski) rarely change, and certainly not overnight. The point in the film at which his claims to have done so are disbelieved, brings genuine catharsis.</p>\n<p>Ben Whishaw is subtle and tender as Tomas&rsquo;s husband, and Adèle Exarchopoulos is characteristically soulful.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2023/passages.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nLast night I went to see [*Passages* (2023)](https://boxd.it/xX9c), a beautifully-shot love triangle tragedy set in Paris. The mechanism of the film is essentially the central character making a series of selfish, ego-driven decisions (or, more accurately, acting on his own desires without much consideration). Those around him — and principally those with whom he's romantically involved — are seen struggling with the profound repercussions. As the third act arrives, you're desperate for other characters to finally draw a line, and call him out. Judging from overheard conversation during the credits, some people in the audience struggled with the protagonist's lack of development. It's certainly frustrating, but I found it to be an accurate portrayal of narcissism: people like Tomas (Franz Rogowski) rarely change, and certainly not overnight. The point in the film at which his claims to have done so are disbelieved, brings genuine catharsis. \r\n\r\nBen Whishaw is subtle and tender as Tomas's husband, and Adèle Exarchopoulos is characteristically soulful. These two are the film's principal loci of empathy, your admiration and sympathy increasing as you become evermore infuriated by Tomas.  \r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/tlmaj.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nLooking for something a little less emotionally fraught, I came home and streamed Céline Devaux's feature debut, [*Tout le monde aime Jeanne* (2022)](https://boxd.it/yQnS) — a light, mature romantic comedy that also touches on loss and depression.

				"content_html": "<p>If chess isn&rsquo;t your thing (yet), you would be forgiven for thinking that chess is chess. But even for games played by the normal rules of chess, there’s a huge variety of time controls that have dramatic impacts on play. You can, of course, play without any time limit, free to leave <em>days</em> between moves if you wish. Games at the FIDE World Cup — which is in its final stages at the moment — are played with 90 minutes on each player’s clock for the first 40 moves, and an additional 30 minutes added after move 40. Also, 30 seconds are added per move. This is a version of the classical chess format, which has endured throughout the game’s long history. But other time controls have gained popularity, perhaps particularly since the advent of online chess. There is Rapid chess, where players might start with anything from 60 minutes to 10 minutes on the clock; Blitz, where clocks start with five or even three minutes, and sometimes two seconds might be added per move; and Bullet, where games can start with as little as 30 seconds on the clock!</p>\n<p>But those are just the chess formats that use the normal rules. There are also numerous variations that tweak the way the game itself is played. For example, there is Chess960, wherein the order of pieces on each player’s home rank is randomised; Crazyhouse, in which pieces you capture can be redeployed on your side; and 4 Player Chess, in which… there are four players, and four sets of pieces on one (larger) board.

The game uses the usual setup of chess pieces, and proceeds as a normal game of chess. The twist is that at set intervals (ie. every three or five moves) one square on the board becomes highlighted, and after the subsequent moves, that square is hit by a meteorite. I can see there being two versions of the game: Meteorite &amp; Meteorite Oblivion. In the latter version, when the meteorite hits the highlighted square, any piece on that square is destroyed, and removed from the board. This is the simpler version of the game, but it still requires both players to adapt their play to accommodate squares which become temporarily hazardous. The game design trick would be in making sure that the squares were selected in a fair way. For example, no squares on the 1, 2, 7, or 8 ranks should probably be targeted at the beginning of the game. Perhaps they become eligible to be meteor struck after 30 moves, incentivising players to develop their pieces earlier. The fun of the game would be to embrace its randomness, but there could also be tweaks to guard against the feeling of unfairness — eg. a setting to provide two moves’ worth of warning before a meteor strikes.</p>\n<p>In the non-Oblivion version of the game, things get a little trickier, and perhaps a little more interesting. Here, instead of destroying the piece on the targeted square, the meteorite <em>devolves</em> it to a lesser piece. So, a struck queen becomes a rook; a rook becomes a knight or bishop; a bishop becomes a pawn; and a struck pawn is destroyed. In the majority of instances, this would still prove an incentive for players to avoid the targeted square, <em>but</em> it would give rise to fascinating board states where it might prove beneficial for a player to deliberately move a rook onto the highlighted square, because devolving it into a knight would provide a positional advantage! Again, there are options here to tweak the rules to make things more or less punishing: perhaps a setting that includes some devolving meteorites, and some that outright destroy, as well as the option to either indicate which type of meteorite is coming, or not.

The dynamics of this song are a marvel to me, and perfectly capture a seemingly effortless knack for imbuing simple pop melodies with aching beauty.

Do people think of ‘Hash Pipe’ and / or ‘Beverly Hills’ now, when you mention Weezer? If so, shame.\n\n[^2]:\tFWIW, the only thing I know right now would beat it, is the piano part at 1:22 – 2:18 on Nina Simone’s ‘My Baby Just Cares For Me’.\n\n[^3]:\tThese are in chronological order.\n\n[^4]:\tNirvana’s ‘Lithium’ / ‘Been a Son’ combo, or The White Stripes’ one-two punch ‘Fell In Love With a Girl’ / ‘Let’s Shake Hands’ are the only couple that come to mind that could maybe compete.\n",

Here are the prices at which some flagship devices start:</p>\n<p>• iPhone 14: £849<br>\n• iPhone 14 Pro: £1,099<br>\n• Google Pixel 7: £599<br>\n• Google Pixel 7 Pro: £849<br>\n• Nothing Phone (2): £579</p>\n<p>I have been an iPhone user since 2011’s iPhone 4S. Over that decade-plus — in which I’ve owned four different models — Apple has worked to ensure that the iPhone has increasingly become the centre of a whole ecosystem of devices and services. The upshot of this strategy (and, indeed, the purpose of it), is that there are significant obstacles for anyone considering a move <em>away</em> from Apple’s phone. As an experiment, I thought I’d do some thinking about what it would mean for me to make the switch.</p>\n<p>As a starting point, let’s consider each of the apps currently on my iPhone’s Home Screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/home-screen.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a></strong> — no Android version is available, but I’m sure there are plenty of calendar apps that would make a fine substitute. However, I would then need to figure out what calendar apps to use on iPad and Mac. At present Fantastical is syncing the iCloud calendars associated with my Apple ID, so I might even need to find a new solution for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather</strong> — not a problem; I’m sure there are good Android weather apps.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></strong> — there actually <em>is</em> an Android version of Apple’s music service, so I wouldn’t need to make a switch.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a></strong> — this one’s easy, as there’s an Android version.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminders</strong> — again, there are certainly acceptable substitutes for this in the Play Store, <em>but</em> one of my main uses of Reminders is for shopping lists shared with my partner. It works seamlessly because our Apple IDs are associated as a family. Getting the same functionality elsewhere would be relatively easy, but would require asking my partner to download a different app — annoying.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a></strong> — no Android version is available, and that’s a significant issue. I’ve used Cultured Code’s task manager to pretty much run my life since January 2010<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. It’s an essential part of how I think about organising things, and I use it everywhere: Mac, iPad, &amp; Apple Watch, but <em>primarily</em> iPhone. Moving away from it would be tricky. My second choice — OmniFocus — also doesn’t have an Android version. I’d have to resort to something like Todoist, which would also incur a paid subscription (unlike Things).</p>\n<p><strong>Photos</strong> — another strong argument for iCloud’s flawless syncing between devices. I’ve been using these things long enough to remember when every photo I took on my phone <em>didn’t</em> automatically appear on all my other devices. But I’m absolutely spoiled by it now, and I don’t want to go back to the days of using middle-man services (eg. syncing to Google Photos, and bridging that to iCloud?) to make sure everything’s available everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hey.com\">HEY</a></strong> — another easy one: there’s an Android version of my email client.</p>\n<p><strong>Messages</strong> — ah, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BuaKzm7Kq9Q\">blue bubble vs green bubble</a> dilemma! Amongst friends and family, iMessage is by far my most commonly used messaging platform. Yes, between WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, &amp; SMS, there are plenty of other options, but the inconvenience of a move away from iMessage isn’t to be underestimated.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thebrowser.company/\">Arc</a></strong> — not a huge loss at present, and perhaps The Browser Company will eventually bring this to Android.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a></strong> — another cross-platform win: an Android version of this journalling app is available.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a></strong> — there’s no Android version of my preferred Mastodon client, and indeed the options look very limited.

And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I’ve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, <em>of course</em> I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple’s ecosystem work together. But I’m not going to pretend there isn’t a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I have receipts!&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>That’s reserved largely for the iPad.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>possibly before they launch a web version!?&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>and <a href=\"https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html\">not for the first time</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

If the difference between an iPhone and a perfectly capable Android device is £300 each time, that adds up. \n\nOne of the reasons I have mixed feelings about all of this, is that I’m the same person who was, [not so long ago](https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html)[^4], espousing the virtues of not tying oneself into centralised social platforms — of operating independent of any one company’s choices over your experience. And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I’ve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, *of course* I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple’s ecosystem work together. But I’m not going to pretend there isn’t a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in. \n\n[^1]:\tI have receipts!\n\n[^2]:\tThat’s reserved largely for the iPad.\n\n[^3]:\tpossibly before they launch a web version!?\n\n[^4]:\tand [not for the first time](https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html)\n",

				"content_text": "We’re now half way through the year, and it’s tempting to pull together a list of my favourite 2023 records to date... but I think I’ll save that until the [end of year list](/thelists). Instead, here are my favourite ten album covers from the first six months of the year.[^1] \n\n### 10. Superviolet — *Infinite Spring*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/superviolet.png)\n\nI’m not 100% sure about the typeface here, though it’s not distracting. I just love the skyscape — which reminds me of [long Icelandic summer sunsets](https://adam.micro.blog/2018/06/21/010000.html) — and the use of the moon as a kind of punctuation mark.\n\n### 9. Mandy, Indiana — *I’ve Seen a Way*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/mandy-indiana.png)\n\nAt once busy and static — I like the ways in which the sunlight, and the water, bring life to the squared off forms of the walls. \n\n### 8. Nappy Nina — *Mourning Due*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/nappy-nina.png)\n\nA little on the nose perhaps, given the artist’s name, but this makes me smile every time I see it. I appreciate the effort put into the elegant execution of a simple visual joke.\n\n### 7. Albert Hammond Jr. — *Melodies on Hiatus*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/albert.png)\n\nI’ve been a sucker for Helvetica for a long, long time, and it hasn't stopped working for me yet. I like the balance of bold feature typeface and an abstract background. \n\n### 6. Militarie Gun — *Life Under the Gun*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/militarie-gun.png)\n\nI like the painterly qualities of this, and the choice to make it a direct overhead vantage. With the human figures’ shadows, it has something of [Muse’s *Absolution*](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/muse.png) (2003) about it.[^2] \n\n### 5. Unknown Mortal Orchestra — *V*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/umo.png)\n\nI have no idea of the story behind this photo, but the combination of an active, arresting image with the simple rendering of the album’s title works superbly.\n\n### 4. Kelela — *Raven*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/kelela.png)\n\nKelela has a history of strikingly posed record covers, but I think this simple black & white composition is perhaps the best yet. You can almost feel the subtle, living motion in it. \n\n### 3. Lia Kohl — *The Ceiling Reposes*\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/lia-kohl.png)\n\nI love the dark blue on grey, the repeated circular form, the choice to obscure part of the photographed image, and the textured grain effect.

There is a gentle, consistent ease with which it trips the traps of its plot, and ushers in one guest star after another. Unlike some mystery movies, which feel as though they’re going out of their way to prove the cleverness of their plot, <em>Amsterdam</em> is content simply to let its central knot unwind at a slow, gentle pull.

				"title": "Speed Reading Isn't Reading",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader; always have been. And as someone who <em>loves</em> to read, and who chose to pursue <a href=\"/essays\">degrees in literature</a>, I&rsquo;ve long had mixed feelings about the deliberateness with which I&rsquo;ve found that I need to approach texts<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I reflected on this again recently, as I read a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/remembering-robert-gottlieb-editor-extraordinaire\">profile of the late Robert Gottlieb</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gottlieb was a showoff, but not of the athletic sort. When he was in high school, he read “War and Peace” in “a single marathon fourteen-hour session.” As an undergraduate, at Columbia, he read Proust: “seven volumes, seven days.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Taking the latter of those first, the task of making one&rsquo;s way through <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> in a week, means reading about 181,000 words per day, for seven days straight. That pace is <em>way</em> beyond my reach, even for a single day! I once read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> in one day: it&rsquo;s 73,404 words, and left little time for anything else.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s turning to the <em>War and Peace</em> claim that really makes me question whether this story about Gottlieb is apocryphal. Tolstoy&rsquo;s opus is 587,287 words. To read it in a 14 hour sitting as claimed, you&rsquo;d have to go at a little under 42,000 words per hour, or 700 words per minute, non-stop, for 840 minutes.</p>\n<p>It brought to mind that quote, <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/08/speed-reading/\">usually attributed to Woody Allen</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I took a speed-reading course and read <em>War and Peace</em> in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst searching for that, I found a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/opinion/l-war-and-peace-in-20-minutes-if-you-care-what-it-says-read-449395.html\">1995 letter to the Editor of the NY Times</a>, from communications consultant Dr Phyllis Mindell, in which she decries the practice of &lsquo;speed reading&rsquo;. Here are a couple of sections that chimed for me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Study after study demonstrates that although people can skim at extremely high rates (as much as 100,000 words a minute), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they gain substantially no comprehension<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is exactly my experience: fly through the text and I end up with no significant understanding of it. Perhaps because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[F]ailure must result from any method that assumes that reading is primarily a visual task<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that one can &ldquo;take in whole pages at a single glance,&rdquo; [&hellip;] or that the approach to reading remains independent of the content of the material to be read or the purposes of reading</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reading is a practice of comprehension, conducted only at first with the eyes, and then primarily with that miraculous organ directly behind them. The letter quotes a wonderful phrasing of this task, by Stanley Elkin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most trenchant critiques of &ldquo;speed reading&rdquo; emerge, directly or indirectly, from the strongest readers.

And as someone who *loves* to read, and who chose to pursue [degrees in literature](/essays), I've long had mixed feelings about the deliberateness with which I've found that I need to approach texts[^1]. I reflected on this again recently, as I read a [profile of the late Robert Gottlieb](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/remembering-robert-gottlieb-editor-extraordinaire): \n\n> Gottlieb was a showoff, but not of the athletic sort. When he was in high school, he read “War and Peace” in “a single marathon fourteen-hour session.” As an undergraduate, at Columbia, he read Proust: “seven volumes, seven days.”\n\nTaking the latter of those first, the task of making one's way through *In Search of Lost Time* in a week, means reading about 181,000 words per day, for seven days straight. That pace is *way* beyond my reach, even for a single day! I once read *The Catcher in the Rye* in one day: it's 73,404 words, and left little time for anything else. \n\nBut it's turning to the *War and Peace* claim that really makes me question whether this story about Gottlieb is apocryphal. Tolstoy's opus is 587,287 words. To read it in a 14 hour sitting as claimed, you'd have to go at a little under 42,000 words per hour, or 700 words per minute, non-stop, for 840 minutes.\n\nIt brought to mind that quote, [usually attributed to Woody Allen](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/08/speed-reading/):\n\n> I took a speed-reading course and read *War and Peace* in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.\n\nWhilst searching for that, I found a [1995 letter to the Editor of the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/opinion/l-war-and-peace-in-20-minutes-if-you-care-what-it-says-read-449395.html), from communications consultant Dr Phyllis Mindell, in which she decries the practice of 'speed reading'. Here are a couple of sections that chimed for me:\n\n> Study after study demonstrates that although people can skim at extremely high rates (as much as 100,000 words a minute), <mark>they gain substantially no comprehension</mark> in the process.\n\nThis is exactly my experience: fly through the text and I end up with no significant understanding of it. Perhaps because:\n\n> <mark>[F]ailure must result from any method that assumes that reading is primarily a visual task</mark>, that one can \"take in whole pages at a single glance,\" [...] or that the approach to reading remains independent of the content of the material to be read or the purposes of reading\n\nReading is a practice of comprehension, conducted only at first with the eyes, and then primarily with that miraculous organ directly behind them. The letter quotes a wonderful phrasing of this task, by Stanley Elkin:\n\n> The most trenchant critiques of \"speed reading\" emerge, directly or indirectly, from the strongest readers. The writer Stanley Elkin, for example, called reading <mark>\"fine, precise, detailed work, the infinitely small motor managements of diamond cutters and safecrackers that we do in our heads.\"</mark>\n\nJust as people who think they're multi-tasking are more likely doing several things poorly, I remain convinced that 'speed readers' are actually just looking at patterns, and not engaged in the act of comprehension that I understand reading to be. 📚  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div>\n\n<sc>PS</sc> It is certainly not my intention here to besmirch the good name of the late Robert Gottlieb, may he rest in peace.\n\n[^1]: Some things certainly would have been easier if I could have made my way through long novels on syllabi in hours instead of days. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since I last posted I&rsquo;ve read a couple of books, both of them a little disappointing, but by no means without merit:</p>\n<p>The first was Gabrielle Zevin&rsquo;s much-hyped <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> (2022), which I found both frustratingly divorced from the practical realities of the video game industry (in which it is set), and too eager to undermine its female lead by placing her into romantic relationships with virtually every male character in the novel.</p>\n<p>The second was Nell Zink&rsquo;s <em>Avalon</em> (2022), which is dense with ideas, but I found the through-lines of its characters to be too faintly pencilled.

Tim Maughan’s 2019 novel, <em>Infinite Detail</em>, is concerned with a very different worldwide disaster: one which is &lsquo;viral&rsquo; in a digital sense, rather than in a biological / epidemiological one. Nevertheless, the allegory bears fruit by virtue of the extent to which Maughan is interested in the secondary effects of isolation, scarcity, and precarity. Separated into ‘Before’ and ‘After’ chapters, the novel&rsquo;s fulcrum is an act of technological terrorism that results in the complete collapse of the internet. Maughan — who has written for outlets including the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BBC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <em>New Scientist</em>, and <em>Vice</em> on ‘cities, class, culture, technology’ etc. — uses this pivot as means to explore both our current (over-)dependence on networked systems, and the potential shape of consequences to their collapse. For those of us who, not long ago, queued to get into supermarkets, where a mix of fear, greed, and straining infrastructure had already rendered shelves mostly empty, there are passages here that have grown eerily familiar in the years since the novel&rsquo;s publication.</p>\n<p>Maughan draws characters well enough, incorporating voices recognisable from the south west of Britain, in which large portions of the novel are set. Things are a little less sharply rendered with respect to the through-lines of characters’ motivations, and the architecture of the novel’s overall plot. The alternating ‘Before’ &amp; ‘After’ chapter headings have the unfortunate effect of casting the technological catastrophe as the narrative’s center point. And when it comes (in the form of a pseudo-manifesto more than half way through the text), it is underwhelming, largely comprising such edgelord bons mots as ‘we let ourselves become nothing more than the content between adverts’ and ‘SkyNet is real, and it wants to sell you shoes made by child slaves’.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, however, this is Maughan’s point: this is an act of terrorism perpetrated by people who consider it an act of liberation via vandalism, and whom prove shamefully ignorant of the extensive consequences. To his credit — and the novel’s benefit — less focus is spent on the mechanics of the collapse (settling for hand-waving talk of viruses, worms, and floods of junk data) than on how people — and collectives of people — cope. In mining this vein of narrative, Maughan is commendably unromantic, even-handedly exploring the undeniable negatives of commercialised hyper-connectivity, but also the ways in which forced disconnection could be worse.

Back in 2018 — at the age of 37 — I <em>finally</em> achieved something that had been a goal of mine for pretty much as long as I can remember: I completed the first draft of a novel.</p>\n<p>I have wanted to be &lsquo;a writer&rsquo; since childhood. And, whilst my relationship to that concept, that label, and that practice, has complicated over the decades, I still count writing amongst my few ambitions<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I am fascinated by writing as an activity, a state of mind, and a mode of thought; in my experience, nothing is quite like it. No practice is more clarifying than sitting down to write out one&rsquo;s thoughts on a subject (as I am doing right now). Amongst other things, it forces you into an assessment of each statement&rsquo;s veracity, and allows you to build a path of sense-making, stone-by-stone, at the same time as walking it.</p>\n<p>I can also say honestly that there is almost nothing in the world that I love more than stories. Just this Christmas, my father recalled asking me when I was eight years old, why — in my otherwise fastidiously neat room<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> — there were more than half a dozen books littering the windowsill. The reply he received — &ldquo;Those are the ones I&rsquo;m reading at the moment&rdquo; — baffled him, but makes sense to me even now, as someone who has openly confessed my <a href=\"/litmonogamy\">struggles with literary monogamy</a>. Books, film, television, theatre, video games — I have an abiding love of each form, and I&rsquo;ll happily witter on about <a href=\"/ondaatjesentence\">poetics</a>, or <a href=\"/theroad\">cinematography</a>, or <a href=\"/tendrils013\">ludonarrative dissonance</a> at the drop of a hat. <em>But</em>, the deepest-set hook that each of these artistic forms has in me, is that of narrative. I will let slide uninspiring direction, endure poor acting, and wade through all manner of lacklustre gameplay if you have a good story to tell me. Stories, stories, stories. I cannot get enough of them, and I am unashamedly omnivorous about where I get them. I have taken as much pleasure in this regard from films starring Elvis Presley, as I have from some productions of Shakespeare.</p>\n<p>All of which has informed a lifelong desire to make a contribution of my own to the great collective pool of stories. That feeling, at the end of 2018, of reaching completion on a draft of a novel, is something I won&rsquo;t soon forget. I have lost count of the number of my abortive previous attempts: projects that failed as early as the outlining stage, and as late as being half written. One of the things I felt when I completed that first draft, was relief at how much that successful project had pulled from those that had flickered out before it. A good number of ideas, characters, and plot threads, surprised me by surviving the early demise of the stories that had been their genesis — reappearing, to my delight, as I progressed with the draft that was ultimately to succeed.</p>\n<p>And I use the words &lsquo;succeed&rsquo; and &lsquo;successful&rsquo; advisedly above. To my mind, the fact that that story was taken from start to finish, and exists in a fully readable form, is a success. Shortly after completing that first draft, I made an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EPUB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, and gave it to six people, all of whom were kind enough to read it, and offer a few notes. But that, as the saying goes, was that.</p>\n<p>In his excellent craft memoir <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing%3A_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft\"><em>On Writing</em></a> (2000), Stephen King recommends that, after completing a first draft, the writer puts the manuscript in a drawer for a few months, so as to return to it with relatively fresh eyes when undertaking a second draft. To the best of my recollection, that was my intention in 2019, when I took those notes from early readers. But the months stretched on until they became years. And in that time, though I&rsquo;ve not done much more than peek at the document myself<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>, the problems with that first draft multiplied and metastasised in my mind to the point that even the <em>idea</em> of wading back in to try and fix them, felt increasingly daunting, and perhaps futile. Overmatched by the problem, I did not touch the novel in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>. That&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> longer than Mr. King recommends, and I am almost certain that if I were to return to it now, I would be doing so not only with fresh eyes, but with a relatively consistent sense of surprise — for better or worse — at what I had put on the page.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;ve resolved to do just that.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-ingrid-andress--good-person\">20. Ingrid Andress — <em>Good Person</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t consider myself a country music fan. Perhaps the first significant crack in that wall was falling pretty hard for Kacey Musgraves’ <em>Golden Hour</em> in 2018, and there have certainly been country-inflected pop albums that have worked for me before and since. However, Ingrid Andress is perhaps the first artist to make my list whom it would be fair to label ‘country‘, and yet even here I suspect that there are enough pop and folk elements, that hardcore genre sticklers wouldn&rsquo;t consider it a purebred country record. Regardless, across a dozen simple compositions, Andress proves herself to be not only in possession of a rich, warm voice but also an impressive ear for memorable melodies. Title track and opener ‘Good Person‘ is a heart-on-sleeve paean to personal character, so earnest that it feels astounding it hasn&rsquo;t been done a thousand times before. Follow-up ‘Yearbook‘ is a masterclass in sweet and sad storytelling. Then ‘Seeing Someone Else‘ is an Olivia Rodrigo-style ‘my ex is with someone who looks like me‘ sing-along, with a fun twist! And, speaking of last year’s List-topper, ‘Pain’ here sure sounds very close to Rodrigo’s ‘Traitor’, but has enough charm of its own so as not to feel entirely derivative.</p>\n<p>It’s a surpassingly easy-going and consistent record; I often found myself wandering around humming ‘Feels Like This’ or ‘How Honest Do You Want Me To Be?’ until I had to put the album on for one more spin. This clarity and quality of songwriting is always going to work for me, whether you call it pop, country, or anything else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-tallies--patina\">19. Tallies — <em>Patina</em></h3>\n<p>Toronto four-piece Tallies were new to me this year, and had I encountered this record divorced of context I likely would have suspected it was from somewhere in the early or mid-90s. (The cover even seems to be a nod to 4AD output from the era, like Pixies, Belly, &amp; Red House Painters.) Lightly-treated vocals across beds of layered, fuzzed guitars — it has the feel of vintage dream-pop, a sound that either had a resurgence this year, or which I became enamoured of in a new way. I have had flirtations before with artists like Beach House and Grizzly Bear, but <em>Patina</em> perhaps brings something to the mix that was missing for me: a sense of lightness, and maybe a poppier tint.</p>\n<p>At 34 minutes and 9 tracks, there isn’t a great deal of variety here, but (this being their sophomore LP) Tallies have brought together a set of tracks that cohere as a sustained mood, into which it is a pleasure to immerse oneself. The compositions are restrained, relying more upon the shifting, shimmering production than on quiet-loud dynamics, to sustain attention. It’s a remarkably easy record to listen to, and yet — like many of those 90s progenitors — yields fruit when closer attention is paid. I need to go back and check out the debut, and I’ll be interested to see whether Tallies continue in this well-worn groove, or push their envelope on a follow-up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-nilüfer-yanya--painless\">18. Nilüfer Yanya — <em>PAINLESS</em></h3>\n<p>Nilüfer Yanya has a few releases under her belt at this point — including a pair of EPs, and a 2019 debut LP: <em>Miss Universe</em> — all of which flew under my (obviously poorly-tuned) radar. When the buzz around <em>PAINLESS</em> started to build this spring, it didn&rsquo;t take very long for me to key into a record comprising a lot of sounds I have a history with. It&rsquo;s an intriguing mix: downtempo, post-grunge-adjacent arrangements with the addition of prettier, poppier accents; a quasi-shoegazey gauze over the production, and a low key vocal style that ranges down to a rich bass. Whilst this particular fusion feels unique, it did call to mind the sonic worlds of artists like <a href=\"/list2017\">Jay Som</a> &amp; <a href=\"/list2021\">Bachelor</a>, who have made top-five appearances on these lists in recent years.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘the dealer’ rides a neat mix of strummed guitar and busy drums, with a bass-line that comes in to ground the choruses. It’s moody and assuredly composed, as is the next track: ‘L/R’, with its slower tempo and shifting vocal. ‘stabilise’ is one of the best Bloc Party songs of the year, and closer ‘anotherlife’ leaves the record on one of its sunnier notes.</p>\n<p>Yanya ends 2022 with an appearance on Nigel Godrich’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bzfbGDUrpjw\"><em>From the Basement</em></a> series. It&rsquo;s a warm and intimate set that showcases the strong construction of these songs, and a welcome companion piece to a headphones-first record that has stuck with me throughout most of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-bloc-party--alpha-games\">17. Bloc Party — <em>Alpha Games</em></h3>\n<p>Each time Arcade Fire put out a record, I go through a cycle wherein at first I feel underwhelmed, and then — after spending more time with the album — I come to better appreciate it. That pattern didn’t hold for me with this year’s Arcade Fire release (<em>WE</em>, which you won&rsquo;t find on this list), but instead, I found myself doing the same dance with another album: the sixth from long-time favourites Bloc Party.</p>\n<p>Each previous BP record has made a top-20 spot*, and in fact this is their first to drop outside of the top 10. As alluded to above, however, there was a stretch of several months following <em>Alpha Games’</em> April release in which it wasn&rsquo;t in contention at all. Only my enduring affinity for the band kept me returning to the album long enough for it to charm me.</p>\n<p>I think part of this evolving response to the record is rooted in the extent to which the sound of <em>Alpha Games</em> represents a step back, to something closer to the sound of <em>older</em> Bloc Party records. I called 2016&rsquo;s <em>Hymns</em> <a href=\"/list2016\">‘quietly revolutionary’</a>, whilst praising the new textures the band were playing with. The album before that — 2012&rsquo;s <em>Four</em> — also felt like it had adjusted from the sound that had, until then, defined the band: it was more muscular and assertive. <em>Alpha Games</em>, then, was at first confusing given that it sounded to me more like the Bloc Party of 2008, than that of the past decade-plus. The reliance on more complex, syncopated drum sounds is stronger; there is a return to prominence for the guitar, which had taken something of a back-seat on <em>Hymns</em>. However, there is no avoiding the fact that 50% of the band&rsquo;s personnel has changed since they last made music in this vein, and as such the sound is at once familiar and slightly altered.</p>\n<p>It was only once I got past the mental stumbling block that all these comparisons represent, that I started to enjoy <em>Alpha Games</em> on its own merits. Then, it really opened up for me, and before long I found myself wondering why I once had a hard time with it. There&rsquo;s a lot to enjoy in the driving rhythms of singles, ‘Traps‘ and ‘The Girls Are Fighting’; the restrained anger of the unhinged ‘Callum is a Snake’, with its borrowed garage drumbeat; and the softer, more upbeat ‘In Situ’. Some of my favourite moments, however, are the quieter ones. ‘Of Things to Come’ is grown from the same tree as one of my Bloc Party favourites: <em>Intimacy</em> closer ‘Ion Square’. And the final pair here — ‘If We Get Caught’ &amp; ‘The Peace Offering’ — bring an otherwise quite frenetic record in for a graceful landing.</p>\n<p>Where they go from here, I’m not sure. But, I do know I’ll be eager to go along for the ride.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->* 4th in 2005; 8th in 2007; 3rd in 2008; 4th in 2012; 4th in 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"16-horsegirl--versions-of-modern-performance\">16. Horsegirl — <em>Versions of Modern Performance</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s another album steeped in a sound from the 90s, but this time the influence is clearly from the likes of The Breeders and Sonic Youth. Indeed, Chicago’s Horsegirl supported Pavement on tour this year — no small feat for a three-piece whose members weren’t born when <em>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em> (1992) helped set the template for a certain strain of slacker indie rock.</p>\n<p>On songs like ‘Dirtbag Transformation (Still Dirty)’ and ‘World of Pots and Pans’ the group centres their knack for catchy tunes to shuffle your feet to, possibly with your chin on your chest. Opener ‘Anti-Glory’ and fellow single ‘Option 8’ are more upfront about their gifts of melody, both underpinned by strong percussion. Tracks such as ‘Live and Ski’ make excellent use of the group’s two-vocalists setup, and elsewhere the inclusion of instrumental caesura delights in the tone of guitars fed through warm and fuzzy effects pedals.</p>\n<p>The re-emergence of these 90s sounds was notable for me this year. I mentioned Tallies’ reaching back to peak dream-pop; here Horsegirl are pulling from other 4AD artists, as well as those on Matador in the early part of that decade. And we’re not done yet. I don’t know if all this genuinely was part of a larger 90s resurgence, or whether I just got particularly nostalgic in ’22.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-warpaint--radiate-like-this\">15. Warpaint — <em>Radiate Like This</em></h3>\n<p>Warpaint missed a spot on my list in 2010 only by virtue of how late I came to their debut: <em>The Fool</em>. I’ve enjoyed albums since then — particularly 2014’s self-titled record — but it was immediately apparent to me that <em>Radiate Like This</em> hits a new level, after a six-year hiatus. The band’s supremely laid-back strain of psychedelic indie rock, refined now to an unmistakable signature sound, is cut here with new touches. A programmed drum line or two, some R&amp;B harmonies here &amp; there, I’ll even allow the steel pan on ‘Melting‘ — normally an instrument I would go out of my way to avoid. Faintly detectable trip-hop and lo-fi influences help refresh Warpaint&rsquo;s ongoing project: a genre-blending exercise that is now more than a decade old. But, even as more prominent artists have begun working in similar borderlands, few have arrived at songs as polished and effortless-seeming as ‘Hard to Tell You’ (which features the lightest touch of 80s synth), or ‘Stevie’ — a potential radio hit if it were forced to dress up and dance to a higher tempo, but which here sounds like Sananda Maitreya on benzodiazepine.</p>\n<p>The vocals remain one of the group’s strongest pulls: Kokal, Wayman, &amp; Lindberg’s soft croons weaving amongst one another, perfect partners to the languid, hazy instrumentation. It’s a spell Warpaint have become increasingly adept at casting, and one which feels refined to me on <em>Radiate Like This</em> in a way that was promised as far back as their debut. At the centre of the record are a pair of songs (‘Trouble’ &amp; ‘Proof’), which reach back more directly to <em>The Fool</em>, and in doing so call out a commendably subtle evolution in tone that might otherwise have gone undetected across the band&rsquo;s decade-plus of releases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-beach-bunny--emotional-creature\">14. Beach Bunny — <em>Emotional Creature</em></h3>\n<p>Chicago four-piece Beach Bunny hit the lofty heights of <a href=\"/list2020\">fourth on my 2020 list</a>, with their debut: <em>Honeymoon</em>. It was my absolute pleasure this year, to discover that there was plenty more where those joyous nine tracks came from.</p>\n<p>On first listen, there doesn’t appear to be anything very complicated here; this is just a group of people with a first-class ear for hook and melody, employing those talents through lightly-fuzzed guitar, bass, and simple, functional percussion. The production (by Sean O’Keefe) feels a little cleaner than on the first record, perhaps indicative of a little more money having been spent by the good folks at Mom+Pop (now also home to Tegan &amp; Sara, which might make for a neat touring pair).</p>\n<p>On further listens, however, it becomes clearer that — in keeping with that album title — there is not only variety to the emotions behind these songs (anxiety, passion, regret…), but also that the character of the songs themselves runs a wider spectrum than on their debut: punk-adjacent (‘Gone’) to acoustic folk-adjacent (‘Infinity Room’), and plenty of tones in-between. Throughout, however, the album’s core charm is another set of well-crafted singalongs at the poppier end of pop-rock. Records from this approximate continent of the musical map have been pushing my buttons for decades, which I think speaks to both the potency of the form, and Beach Bunny’s skill in capturing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-yugen--you\">13. Yugen — <em>You</em></h3>\n<p>This is the debut LP from Han Frissen working as Yugen. (His day job is running Dutch electronica label Konstrukt). Opening track ‘Resfeber’ serves as an exercise in mood-setting (complete with melodic flute), before ‘Toraberu’ begins to usher in a wider sonic palate for a record that pulls from multiple eras and subgenres of electronica, including reaching back to 90s sounds of which I’ve grown increasingly fond.</p>\n<p>‘Seclusion’ stirs trip-hop elements in with breakbeat — a combination I would have raised an eyebrow at before I heard it, but which Frissen weaves into something either propulsive or a little maudlin, depending on whether you focus your attention on its dense arrangement of beats, or the slow waves of synth.</p>\n<p>There are moments in which the beats are more rigorous, but the album never seeks to entirely shed its overall air of playfulness. Closer ‘Inves’, for example, begins as a somewhat strident march, before gentler, pastel-toned elements are brought forth in the mix to soften it, and a new balance is found.</p>\n<p>I found the formula for this record to be magnetic: complex percussive arrangements, expertly wedded to expansive melodies. Yugen melds the two expertly, so as to bring forth a set of beautiful, subtle techno that made for some of my favourite headphone listening this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-mall-grab--what-i-breathe\">12. Mall Grab — <em>What I Breathe</em></h3>\n<p>As seriously as I take music, and as large a part of my life as it is, I’m still sometimes skeptical about the utility of sub-genre labels. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the digitisation of music, and particularly the advent of MP3s, brought about a previously unthinkable explosion in access to music, and thus any barriers previously gating exposure to even the most esoteric of sounds, evaporated. There’s a strong argument to be made, that a generation of musicians has now grown up entirely in a culture where every shade and strain of music enjoyed a level playing field. Yes, certain flavours of pop, hip-hop etc. still have the largest marketing budgets, and the most FM airplay. But, it’s only a matter of turning on one’s laptop or phone to access a whole world of sound. My thesis here — which I’m admittedly presenting solely on the basis of personal observation — is that sub-genres (and, arguably, genres themselves to an increasing extent) mean less now than they ever have, because an increasing number of artists feel free to ignore them, or work across them.</p>\n<p>Depending on the whim of the staff, you might find Mall Grab’s debut LP in either the Dance, Electronic, or Techno sections of your local record store. First track ‘Hand in Hand Through Wonderland’ is a trance-adjascent piece centred on a pretty, chiming keyboard run, before ‘I Can Remember It So Vividly’ snatches the baton, and sprints with it. ‘Love Reigns’ is more-or-less straight house, with euphoric piano. Then, Turnstile’s Brendan Yates shows up to provide both screaming &amp; soothing vocals on ‘Understand’ — a track which otherwise sounds more like Bicep. That’s a run down of less than 1/3 of the record, and I’m already dizzy. What follows touches neo-soul, grime, and pure club sounds, before late highlight ‘Metaphysical’ — a mélange of techno breakbeats and ominous synths — and ‘Lost in Harajuku’ ring things out more subtly.</p>\n<p>All of which sounds as though the record could be an un-coordinated, directionless mess. Whatever magic Jordon Alexander is working in the tight production helps tie the thing together, and made it a giddily enjoyable experience for me from first spin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-amber-mark--three-dimensions-deep\">11. Amber Mark — <em>Three Dimensions Deep</em></h3>\n<p>Released on 28 January, this debut LP from R&amp;B / soul singer-songwriter Amber Mark is the longest standing record on this list. Since I first heard the opening salvo of ‘One’, eleven months ago, this was a strong contender, and it has only grown on me over time. The immediate allure was in poppier moments like the aforementioned ‘One’, on which Mark both sings soulfully and sing-raps her struggle with anger and insecurity. Follow-up ‘What It Is’ only further established this record&rsquo;s many gifts: a bold neo-soul slide which makes the most of Mark&rsquo;s impressive voice by layering it into the smoothest possible harmonies. The soulful ‘Most Men’ completes an opening trinity as strong as it is varied. But we&rsquo;re only getting started. ’Healing Hurts’ cuts an R&amp;B ballad with a pseudo-trap beat, for results far more compelling than that sounds; ‘Bubbles’ heads for the dance floor; elsewhere there are funk touches, blues samples, and lush string arrangements, all tied together by Mark&rsquo;s supremely polished songwriting, and velvet vocals. ‘Softly’ even samples turn-of-the-millennium Craig David to charming effect!</p>\n<p>But the honeyed pop that drew me is really only the first layer of what proves to be a deeper record. Repeated listens reveal the extent to which Mark is telling a story across the hour running time. In a rough three act structure, she maps a journey through grief, towards acceptance. It’s easy to miss when you’re swaying to the funk arrangements of ‘Foreign Things’, or late highlight ‘Bliss’, but this is the most assured of debuts: musically and thematically vibrant and ambitious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-yeah-yeah-yeahs--cool-it-down\">10. Yeah Yeah Yeahs — <em>Cool It Down</em></h3>\n<p>A new Yeah Yeah Yeahs record was always going to get my attention. Their 2003 debut, <em>Fever to Tell</em>, was an absolutely central part of the vanguard of exciting records that defined the sound of rock music in the early 21st century (alongside fellow heavy hitters like The Strokes' <em>Is This It,</em> Kings of Leon’s <em>Youth &amp; Young Manhood,</em> The White Stripes’ <em>White Blood Cells</em> etc.). In my estimation, follow-up <em>Show Your Bones</em> (2006) was not only better, but elevated to the pantheon of my favourite rock albums. It was third on my list that year, and has had more staying power for me in the years since than has proven true of the album immediately ahead of it: Thom Yorke’s <em>The Eraser</em> — a record I still play, but which I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself passionate about.</p>\n<p>YYYs have certainly fallen off for me since: 2009’s <em>It’s Blitz</em> was pretty good (but notably not good enough for a list spot); 2013&rsquo;s <em>Mosquito</em> was largely forgettable — indeed, I don&rsquo;t think I’ve played it in the last 9 years. All of which makes <em>Cool It Down</em> the most pleasant of surprises.</p>\n<p>Surely it’s no coincidence that opener ’Spitting Off the Edge of the World’ sits atop the same drum beat that powered <em>Show Your Bones</em>' opener ‘Gold Lion’. Here, however, it is both slower and more muted in the mix: a more relaxed, less bombastic heartbeat for a new YYYs sound.</p>\n<p>Across a lot of different releases this year I noted a version of this slowing, along with an increased interest in dreamier, gauzier sounds. Dream-pop tones coloured several albums I enjoyed in 2022, but which didn’t end up making this list: shouts to SRSQ’s <em>Ever Crashing</em>, Jockstrap&rsquo;s <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em>, and even Taylor Swift&rsquo;s <em>Midnights</em> — all of which are playing with these colours to some extent. Overall, however, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' implementation — which reaches back to elements of their sound that have existed since they first arrived — worked on me like magic. Yes, it may be classifiable as a crime to have Nick Zinner (a genuinely top-tier guitarist) hardly pick up a guitar on this album, but Karen O&rsquo;s vocal shines when surrounded by floating synths.</p>\n<p>I certainly wouldn’t object if, next year, they followed it up with half an hour of pure garage rock, but in the here and now, <em>Cool It Down</em> really is something pretty special.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-duval-timothy--meeting-with-a-judas-tree\">9. Duval Timothy — <em>Meeting With a Judas Tree</em></h3>\n<p>Earlier this year I found myself in a jazz rut, which in turn led me down a jazz rabbit hole. I had been enjoying <em>Opening</em> by the Tord Gustavsen Trio*, but no other 2022 releases had stuck for me. So, I started casting about for new sounds, and at some point my exploration landed upon the 2017 album <em>Sen Am</em>, by Duval Timothy — a startling construction of piano-first jazz, and ambience. I developed a mild obsession with the record&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies, playing it so much that, when Timothy&rsquo;s new LP arrived in November, I immediately found myself struck by both its similarities and its differences.</p>\n<p>First, the similarities. <em>Meeting With a Judas Tree</em> contains sections that read as direct responses, or otherwise continuations, of pieces from the five-year-old <em>Sen Am</em>. (It should be said, there are several releases in between, which I have not yet taken the time to adequately explore (beyond a cursory listen to Timothy&rsquo;s intriguing 2021 collaboration with pop / alternative singer-songwriter, Rosie Lowe), and so it&rsquo;s quite possible this is a musical conversation Duval Timothy has been carrying on <em>throughout</em> his work.) The four note sequences that underpin opener ‘Plunge’, feel unmistakably like an evolution of the refrain that plays the same role on <em>Sen Am</em>&rsquo;s first track ‘Whatsapp’; the older album’s ‘Ibs’ is reflected and refracted here on ‘Up’ — its joyful central melody re-situated amidst layers of effects, and treated audio samples.</p>\n<p>This is one of the differences: a deepening (in places) of layers; an increased incorporation of field recordings, and looped elements, present on <em>Sen Am</em> but given new shapes here. Timothy&rsquo;s own liner notes also speak to a variety of recording techniques. One, which I found interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recorded on different pianos, including an upright in Freetown that had lost the felt of its hammers due to the humidity creating a harpsichord-like sound as the raw wood hit the strings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) its relative delicacy, this was some of the most captivating music I heard all year, and certainly amongst the most beautiful. I was disappointed to miss the screenings of an accompanying short film at the ICA, but such mistakes are less likely to recur now that I’m officially hooked on every move Duval Timothy makes.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->* indeed, it was one of the final shortlist of 35 records in contention for this list<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"8-dusky--pressure\">8. Dusky — <em>Pressure</em></h3>\n<p>From memory, this may be the first straight-up garage record that has made one of these lists. I’ve certainly had albums from the dancier-end of the electronica spectrum before, but this is a thoroughbred. It’s <em>also</em> explicitly an exercise in revisiting an older sound, which is perfect for me as someone who remained largely oblivious to the charms of dance music until a decade into the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Even so, the primary building blocks here are now familiar to me: 2-step drum patterns, 4x4 rhythms, and playful use of vocal samples. The treated vocals and warping bass of ‘Northbound’ always inspires an increase in volume, and the (admittedly somewhat risible) vocal interjections on ‘Bubblin’’ never fail to bring a smile to my face. In fact, joy — more than anything else — is what I associate with this record. From the very first time I played it, dancing around my living room in the dark, it was a lock for this list. Its charms have not faded in the months since. When the bass kicks in on ‘Rollers’, followed by the vocal, and a chiming flourish that sounds like it could belong to a 16-bit <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game, catch me vibing!</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-brainwaltzera--itsame\">7. Brainwaltzera — <em>ITSAME</em></h3>\n<p>Here, across 17 tracks and 74 minutes, the pseudonymous producer behind the Brainwaltzera alias lays out a banquet of sound which feels coherent and focussed despite its scope. <em>ITSAME</em> is defined by its meticulous arrangements of crisp, skittery beats and stuttering rhythms, and the interplay between those components and the frequent use of bright, warm chords.</p>\n<p>Elements sit on a spectrum from the brief, light raindrops of ‘F1 Halo’, and the gentle melody atop ‘Morning Narcomnastics’, to the frenetic popcorn beat that rises and falls away on tracks like ‘A Star is Bored’ and ‘medal headz (G.B.D.F.)`. The record as a whole is a melting pot of styles and sounds, but in an arrangement that always feels as though it’s restlessly pushing for something new. Album highlight ‘Fwd: Re: late (Ref.: karoshi)’ is a six-minute simulacra of the LP: opening on moody chords, it introduces a tangle of synths, then an active, evolving percussive backbone. The wave crests with a moment of relative stillness, before the latter half reconsiders the relationships between now-familiar components. This is a generous and wide-ranging set of electronica with a playful sense of both space and density.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-bonobo--fragments\">6. Bonobo — <em>Fragments</em></h3>\n<p>On his seventh LP for Ninja Tune, Simon Green has pulled together an exceptionally well-crafted array of low-key techno, as warm and inviting as almost any record I played this year.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Polyghost’ is an introductory swell built from harp and strings, before the pulse of ‘Shadows’ arrives. That track showcases a tender vocal by Jordan Rakei atop a simple, clean percussion and continued strings. Elsewhere, ‘Otomo’ has some bombast, and makes admirable use of bagpipes — (like steel pan) an instrument I usually limit my exposure to when possible. ‘Age of Phase’ displays some urgency whilst underpinned by bright chords. ‘Tides’ is measured, whilst allowing Jamila Woods’ simple, honest, and expressive vocal room to breathe. And late highlight ‘Sapien’ brings in choppy synths and frenetic 90s percussion.</p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s composition is primarily subtle techno, with warm orchestral adornment, and down-tempo R&amp;B accents. For me, it’s working in a similar space to SBTRKT’s <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em>, which took <a href=\"/list2014\">third on my 2014 list</a>. Like that album, it&rsquo;s an immensely polished artefact, and — Apple Music informs me — my most-played album of 2022. Multiple tracks, such as ‘Rosewood’ — which exudes warmth &amp; comfort — and ‘Elysian’ — a beautiful, characterful instrumental — conjure worlds of sound I gladly returned, time and again, to immerse myself in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-tove-lo--dirt-femme\">5. Tove Lo — <em>Dirt Femme</em></h3>\n<p>Now here’s a record that immediately announced itself as a strong list contender from play number one. First track, ‘No One Dies From Love’, is one of the year’s best opening statements: an anthem awash with 80s-inspired synth tones, propulsive percussion, and striking, layered vocals. Then, Lo immediately complicates the emotional tone of the record by sequencing ‘Suburbia’ next: a darker flavour of pop, more forthright in tone, in which she rejects the natalist assumption that her new marriage will immediately result in children. Taken together, these two tracks serve as a good microcosm of an album that consistently finds Tove Lo exploring various aspects of her femininity, whilst — it should be made clear — having a lot of fun doing so.</p>\n<p>Album highlight ‘2 Die 4’ is centred around a goosebump-inducing interpolation of Gershon Kingsley’s ‘Popcorn’ (1969) — its an irresistible infusion of joyful trance, and one of my tracks of the year. Elsewhere ‘True Romance’ builds into one of 2022’s most stirring vocal performances; ‘Grapefruit’ is a vulnerable reflection on eating disorders, wrapped in more anthemic 80s synth; and ‘Cute &amp; Cruel’ calls in assistance from First Aid Kit for a slice of grade-A folk balladry.</p>\n<p>Some reviews of the record lamented the fact that Lo’s first outing as an independent artist eschews much of the more overt, confrontationally sexual leanings of her output on four previous albums for a major label. (There is still a song (‘Pineapple Slice’) entirely about cunnilingus.) For me, there’s a sense that this is Lo feeling more mature, less pressed to court notoriety, and more firmly in control of what her music should sound like. The result is an embrace of throwback pop sounds, and a record that is both unflinchingly honest, and unfailingly fun.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Side note: I would like to take this space to note that my 21st-favourite record of 2022 is by another pansexual Swede named Tove. <em>HARD</em> by (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/list2018\">2018 List alumna</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Tove Styrke represents one of the most heart-rending omissions in recent memory, particularly as it contains my undisputed song of the year: ‘Show Me Love’.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"4-black-thought--danger-mouse--cheat-codes\">4. Black Thought &amp; Danger Mouse — <em>Cheat Codes</em></h3>\n<p>Danger Mouse hit my radar in 2003: I had a lot of fun with <em>Ghetto Pop Life</em>, the album-length collaboration he did with Jemini, and I can still hear ‘The Only One’ in my head as I type this, despite having not played it in probably a decade or more. The following year, <em>The Grey Album</em> — his mash-up of Jay-Z&rsquo;s <em>The Black Album</em> (2003) with The Beatles' 1968 &lsquo;white album&rsquo; — was an &lsquo;acquire these MP3s by any means necessary&rsquo; treat.</p>\n<p>Black Thought I knew from his work with The Roots (2002’s <em>Phrenology</em> remains a favourite), but I was (shamefully) less familiar with his solo work.</p>\n<p>In combination here, they’ve produced a soulful masterwork of low-key hip-hop. Danger Mouse’s beats pull from mid-century sounds — not just classic soul and funk, but psychedelia and progressive rock — lending the production a compelling off-kilter edge. Over this strange landscape of distorted organs, altered strings, and often muffled percussion, Black Thought delivers a masterclass in easy flow and scalpel-sharp wordplay.</p>\n<p>There are variations in the production, such that opener ‘Sometimes’ and single ‘Aquamarine’ (which I <em>think</em> is sampling Garbage) feel expansive, whereas ‘Close to Famous’ feels like a straight-to-tape tirade as it rides an uneasy blues beat, and (another single) ‘No Gold Teeth’ is a close-quarters jam to a slice of highly-concentrated funk.</p>\n<p>Front to back, <em>Cheat Codes</em> is a rousing delight; the inclusion of a previously-unheard verse by MF DOOM, on ‘Belize’, is a cherry on top.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-zella-day--sunday-in-heaven\">3. Zella Day — <em>Sunday in Heaven</em></h3>\n<p>Let me start by saying that I have listened to this album innumerable times, and feel no closer to understanding what it means to “mushroom punch [one’s] way down the rabbit hole”, as Zella Day is planning on the opening track. What I <em>can</em> tell you, is that ‘Mushroom Punch’ is a giddy delight that starts as a finger-picked folk tune, before exploding into a piece of Sparks-style operatic pop, and which — a little more than two minutes in — takes a pause for a Bee Gees-esque disco break, replete with hazy synth. That&rsquo;s the opening track: one of the most thrilling pop songs I encountered all year.</p>\n<p>From there, we’re into ‘Am I Still Your Baby’, a self-assured slice of pop-rock on which Day allows her voice to somersault and soar, before sinking to a more intimate register. Then ‘Dance for Love’, which sounds like a lost 70s disco classic wrapped in sultry modern production.</p>\n<p>Something that has become increasingly clear to me over the last few years, (and which may be apparent to the reader of this list) is that my favourite instrument — once the electric guitar — is now most-assuredly the female voice. There are captivating vocal passages on this record that bring to mind Kate Bush and Sinead O’Connor, as much as Lana Del Rey and Florence Welch. In combination with strong musical influences ranging from the golden-era of disco to straight-up country, it’s a record that may be confounding at first, but which has been endlessly fascinating and rewarding for me. From the emotional highs of ‘Golden’ (one album highlight among many) to the lower, but no less impassioned, ‘Last Time’, it’s a dizzying journey I grew increasingly comfortable with, and then found myself spellbound by.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-buck-65--king-of-drums\">2. Buck 65 — <em>King of Drums</em></h3>\n<p>Back in the early 2000s, I had begun the process of expanding my hip-hop horizons beyond the Aftermath Records artists on MTV. I was lucky enough to make friends with a real hip-hop head: a guy whose room in our university halls of residence was messy with vinyl records and obscure kung-fu movies on DVD. At the slightest sign of interest from me, he started pushing this material my way like an eager cult leader, sensing the opportunity to recruit. I didn’t own a turntable, but through sessions sat on his floor I began to absorb Eric B &amp; Rakim, Gang Starr, The Pharcyde, and many others. I count myself lucky to have had someone to raise the curtain for me a little, and show me what lay beyond my Dr Dre and Eminem CDs.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, poking around in the hip-hop section of some record store or another, I stumbled across a pair of albums: one called <em>Primitive Plus</em> (2002) by Edan, and the other titled <em>Square</em> (2002) by Buck 65. Together, these two albums exploded my conception of what hip-hop was, and what it could do. Edan only released one subsequent LP, but I picked up everything Buck 65 (aka Rich Terfry) put out for the next decade-plus. Until, that is, he released <em>Neverlove</em> in 2014, and subsequently went dark. His online presence evaporated, his website was taken down. Eventually I heard he was hosting a drive-time show on Canadian radio.</p>\n<p>As the years stretched on, I had all but lost hope that we’d ever hear a note of new music from Buck 65 again. And yet, here we are. In 2020, Terfry collaborated with Controller 7 on a concept album based around the Vincent Gallo movie <em>Buffalo 66</em> (1998). Perhaps that relit the spark in him to make new music, because in 2022 he has been on a roll: digging in the vaults and putting up buried treasure on Bandcamp; a new collaborative LP with Tachichi; and a fascinating newsletter in which he has candidly laid out the story of his career. Most important of all though: a new Buck 65 record, which knocked my socks clean off the very first time I heard it. Old school production, absolutely <em>peerless</em> beat construction, and that familiar goofy flow spouting the weird and wonderful. It may have been eight years in the making, but my goodness the sheer amount of work and skill that has gone into it is stunning. Masterpiece — and easily his best since the record that completely spun my head two decades ago.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-metric--formentera\">1. Metric — <em>Formentera</em></h3>\n<p>Even amongst albums that I love, there are very few that I would call truly <em>flawless</em>. One of them is Metric’s 2012 LP <em>Synthetica</em> — 43 minutes of unimpeachable, razor-sharp, neon-infused synth-pop-rock; every one of its eleven tracks a gold-plated ★★★★★. That record placed <a href=\"/list2012\">second on my 2012 list</a>, runner-up only to a resurgent Deftones' <em>Koi No Yokan</em> — I still enjoy that album a great deal, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that, at a decade&rsquo;s remove, those places would be switched. It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>\n<p>Metric made another top 5 appearance on my list in 2015, with <em>Pagans in Vegas</em>, but 2018&rsquo;s <em>Art of Doubt</em> (whilst enormously enjoyable) fell a little short for me at the time. All of which brings us to <em>Formentera</em>, which grabbed me with a steel-lined velvet fist upon release in July, and hasn&rsquo;t loosened its grip.</p>\n<p>From 10 minute opening epic ‘Doomscroller’ (which feels like three great songs in one, and embarrasses Arcade Fire at their own game of digital-era, humans-before-technology operatic angst), to the sun-kissed, elegiac closer ‘Paths in the Sky’ (Emily Haines’ voice trampolining up above the burbling bass-line), this is an album of exceptional vision and craft. In between, there’s the darkly joyous ‘All Comes Crashing’, the blissfuly dreamy title track, and the riotous, infectious album highlight ‘False Dichotomy’ — one of the year’s most goosebump-inducing songs, even on the 50th listen.</p>\n<p>Whisper it, but, this might just be their best record.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Ingrid Andress — *Good Person*\n\nI don’t consider myself a country music fan. Perhaps the first significant crack in that wall was falling pretty hard for Kacey Musgraves’ *Golden Hour* in 2018, and there have certainly been country-inflected pop albums that have worked for me before and since. However, Ingrid Andress is perhaps the first artist to make my list whom it would be fair to label ‘country‘, and yet even here I suspect that there are enough pop and folk elements, that hardcore genre sticklers wouldn't consider it a purebred country record. Regardless, across a dozen simple compositions, Andress proves herself to be not only in possession of a rich, warm voice but also an impressive ear for memorable melodies. Title track and opener ‘Good Person‘ is a heart-on-sleeve paean to personal character, so earnest that it feels astounding it hasn't been done a thousand times before. Follow-up ‘Yearbook‘ is a masterclass in sweet and sad storytelling. Then ‘Seeing Someone Else‘ is an Olivia Rodrigo-style ‘my ex is with someone who looks like me‘ sing-along, with a fun twist! And, speaking of last year’s List-topper, ‘Pain’ here sure sounds very close to Rodrigo’s ‘Traitor’, but has enough charm of its own so as not to feel entirely derivative.\n\nIt’s a surpassingly easy-going and consistent record; I often found myself wandering around humming ‘Feels Like This’ or ‘How Honest Do You Want Me To Be?’ until I had to put the album on for one more spin. This clarity and quality of songwriting is always going to work for me, whether you call it pop, country, or anything else.\n\n### 19. Tallies — *Patina*\n\nToronto four-piece Tallies were new to me this year, and had I encountered this record divorced of context I likely would have suspected it was from somewhere in the early or mid-90s. (The cover even seems to be a nod to 4AD output from the era, like Pixies, Belly, & Red House Painters.) Lightly-treated vocals across beds of layered, fuzzed guitars — it has the feel of vintage dream-pop, a sound that either had a resurgence this year, or which I became enamoured of in a new way. I have had flirtations before with artists like Beach House and Grizzly Bear, but *Patina* perhaps brings something to the mix that was missing for me: a sense of lightness, and maybe a poppier tint.\n\nAt 34 minutes and 9 tracks, there isn’t a great deal of variety here, but (this being their sophomore LP) Tallies have brought together a set of tracks that cohere as a sustained mood, into which it is a pleasure to immerse oneself. The compositions are restrained, relying more upon the shifting, shimmering production than on quiet-loud dynamics, to sustain attention. It’s a remarkably easy record to listen to, and yet — like many of those 90s progenitors — yields fruit when closer attention is paid. I need to go back and check out the debut, and I’ll be interested to see whether Tallies continue in this well-worn groove, or push their envelope on a follow-up.\n\n### 18. Nilüfer Yanya — *PAINLESS*\n\nNilüfer Yanya has a few releases under her belt at this point — including a pair of EPs, and a 2019 debut LP: *Miss Universe* — all of which flew under my (obviously poorly-tuned) radar. When the buzz around *PAINLESS* started to build this spring, it didn't take very long for me to key into a record comprising a lot of sounds I have a history with. It's an intriguing mix: downtempo, post-grunge-adjacent arrangements with the addition of prettier, poppier accents; a quasi-shoegazey gauze over the production, and a low key vocal style that ranges down to a rich bass. Whilst this particular fusion feels unique, it did call to mind the sonic worlds of artists like [Jay Som](/list2017) & [Bachelor](/list2021), who have made top-five appearances on these lists in recent years.\n\nOpener ‘the dealer’ rides a neat mix of strummed guitar and busy drums, with a bass-line that comes in to ground the choruses. It’s moody and assuredly composed, as is the next track: ‘L/R’, with its slower tempo and shifting vocal. ‘stabilise’ is one of the best Bloc Party songs of the year, and closer ‘anotherlife’ leaves the record on one of its sunnier notes.\n\nYanya ends 2022 with an appearance on Nigel Godrich’s [*From the Basement*](https://youtu.be/bzfbGDUrpjw) series. It's a warm and intimate set that showcases the strong construction of these songs, and a welcome companion piece to a headphones-first record that has stuck with me throughout most of the year.\n\n### 17. Bloc Party — *Alpha Games*\n\nEach time Arcade Fire put out a record, I go through a cycle wherein at first I feel underwhelmed, and then — after spending more time with the album — I come to better appreciate it. That pattern didn’t hold for me with this year’s Arcade Fire release (*WE*, which you won't find on this list), but instead, I found myself doing the same dance with another album: the sixth from long-time favourites Bloc Party.\n\nEach previous BP record has made a top-20 spot\\*, and in fact this is their first to drop outside of the top 10. As alluded to above, however, there was a stretch of several months following *Alpha Games’* April release in which it wasn't in contention at all. Only my enduring affinity for the band kept me returning to the album long enough for it to charm me.\n\nI think part of this evolving response to the record is rooted in the extent to which the sound of *Alpha Games* represents a step back, to something closer to the sound of *older* Bloc Party records. I called 2016's *Hymns* [‘quietly revolutionary’](/list2016), whilst praising the new textures the band were playing with. The album before that — 2012's *Four* — also felt like it had adjusted from the sound that had, until then, defined the band: it was more muscular and assertive. *Alpha Games*, then, was at first confusing given that it sounded to me more like the Bloc Party of 2008, than that of the past decade-plus. The reliance on more complex, syncopated drum sounds is stronger; there is a return to prominence for the guitar, which had taken something of a back-seat on *Hymns*. However, there is no avoiding the fact that 50% of the band's personnel has changed since they last made music in this vein, and as such the sound is at once familiar and slightly altered.\n\nIt was only once I got past the mental stumbling block that all these comparisons represent, that I started to enjoy *Alpha Games* on its own merits. Then, it really opened up for me, and before long I found myself wondering why I once had a hard time with it. There's a lot to enjoy in the driving rhythms of singles, ‘Traps‘ and ‘The Girls Are Fighting’; the restrained anger of the unhinged ‘Callum is a Snake’, with its borrowed garage drumbeat; and the softer, more upbeat ‘In Situ’. Some of my favourite moments, however, are the quieter ones. ‘Of Things to Come’ is grown from the same tree as one of my Bloc Party favourites: *Intimacy* closer ‘Ion Square’. And the final pair here — ‘If We Get Caught’ & ‘The Peace Offering’ — bring an otherwise quite frenetic record in for a graceful landing.\n\nWhere they go from here, I’m not sure. But, I do know I’ll be eager to go along for the ride.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\\* 4th in 2005; 8th in 2007; 3rd in 2008; 4th in 2012; 4th in 2016</span>\n\n### 16. Horsegirl — *Versions of Modern Performance*\n\nHere’s another album steeped in a sound from the 90s, but this time the influence is clearly from the likes of The Breeders and Sonic Youth. Indeed, Chicago’s Horsegirl supported Pavement on tour this year — no small feat for a three-piece whose members weren’t born when *Slanted & Enchanted* (1992) helped set the template for a certain strain of slacker indie rock.\n\nOn songs like ‘Dirtbag Transformation (Still Dirty)’ and ‘World of Pots and Pans’ the group centres their knack for catchy tunes to shuffle your feet to, possibly with your chin on your chest. Opener ‘Anti-Glory’ and fellow single ‘Option 8’ are more upfront about their gifts of melody, both underpinned by strong percussion. Tracks such as ‘Live and Ski’ make excellent use of the group’s two-vocalists setup, and elsewhere the inclusion of instrumental caesura delights in the tone of guitars fed through warm and fuzzy effects pedals.\n\nThe re-emergence of these 90s sounds was notable for me this year. I mentioned Tallies’ reaching back to peak dream-pop; here Horsegirl are pulling from other 4AD artists, as well as those on Matador in the early part of that decade. And we’re not done yet. I don’t know if all this genuinely was part of a larger 90s resurgence, or whether I just got particularly nostalgic in ’22.\n\n### 15. Warpaint — *Radiate Like This*\n\nWarpaint missed a spot on my list in 2010 only by virtue of how late I came to their debut: *The Fool*. I’ve enjoyed albums since then — particularly 2014’s self-titled record — but it was immediately apparent to me that *Radiate Like This* hits a new level, after a six-year hiatus. The band’s supremely laid-back strain of psychedelic indie rock, refined now to an unmistakable signature sound, is cut here with new touches. A programmed drum line or two, some R&B harmonies here & there, I’ll even allow the steel pan on ‘Melting‘ — normally an instrument I would go out of my way to avoid. Faintly detectable trip-hop and lo-fi influences help refresh Warpaint's ongoing project: a genre-blending exercise that is now more than a decade old. But, even as more prominent artists have begun working in similar borderlands, few have arrived at songs as polished and effortless-seeming as ‘Hard to Tell You’ (which features the lightest touch of 80s synth), or ‘Stevie’ — a potential radio hit if it were forced to dress up and dance to a higher tempo, but which here sounds like Sananda Maitreya on benzodiazepine.\n\nThe vocals remain one of the group’s strongest pulls: Kokal, Wayman, & Lindberg’s soft croons weaving amongst one another, perfect partners to the languid, hazy instrumentation. It’s a spell Warpaint have become increasingly adept at casting, and one which feels refined to me on *Radiate Like This* in a way that was promised as far back as their debut. At the centre of the record are a pair of songs (‘Trouble’ & ‘Proof’), which reach back more directly to *The Fool*, and in doing so call out a commendably subtle evolution in tone that might otherwise have gone undetected across the band's decade-plus of releases.\n\n### 14. Beach Bunny — *Emotional Creature*\n\nChicago four-piece Beach Bunny hit the lofty heights of [fourth on my 2020 list](/list2020), with their debut: *Honeymoon*. It was my absolute pleasure this year, to discover that there was plenty more where those joyous nine tracks came from.\n\nOn first listen, there doesn’t appear to be anything very complicated here; this is just a group of people with a first-class ear for hook and melody, employing those talents through lightly-fuzzed guitar, bass, and simple, functional percussion. The production (by Sean O’Keefe) feels a little cleaner than on the first record, perhaps indicative of a little more money having been spent by the good folks at Mom+Pop (now also home to Tegan & Sara, which might make for a neat touring pair).\n\nOn further listens, however, it becomes clearer that — in keeping with that album title — there is not only variety to the emotions behind these songs (anxiety, passion, regret…), but also that the character of the songs themselves runs a wider spectrum than on their debut: punk-adjacent (‘Gone’) to acoustic folk-adjacent (‘Infinity Room’), and plenty of tones in-between. Throughout, however, the album’s core charm is another set of well-crafted singalongs at the poppier end of pop-rock. Records from this approximate continent of the musical map have been pushing my buttons for decades, which I think speaks to both the potency of the form, and Beach Bunny’s skill in capturing it.\n\n### 13. Yugen — *You*\n\nThis is the debut LP from Han Frissen working as Yugen. (His day job is running Dutch electronica label Konstrukt). Opening track ‘Resfeber’ serves as an exercise in mood-setting (complete with melodic flute), before ‘Toraberu’ begins to usher in a wider sonic palate for a record that pulls from multiple eras and subgenres of electronica, including reaching back to 90s sounds of which I’ve grown increasingly fond.\n\n‘Seclusion’ stirs trip-hop elements in with breakbeat — a combination I would have raised an eyebrow at before I heard it, but which Frissen weaves into something either propulsive or a little maudlin, depending on whether you focus your attention on its dense arrangement of beats, or the slow waves of synth.\n\nThere are moments in which the beats are more rigorous, but the album never seeks to entirely shed its overall air of playfulness. Closer ‘Inves’, for example, begins as a somewhat strident march, before gentler, pastel-toned elements are brought forth in the mix to soften it, and a new balance is found.\n\nI found the formula for this record to be magnetic: complex percussive arrangements, expertly wedded to expansive melodies. Yugen melds the two expertly, so as to bring forth a set of beautiful, subtle techno that made for some of my favourite headphone listening this year.\n\n### 12. Mall Grab — *What I Breathe*\n\nAs seriously as I take music, and as large a part of my life as it is, I’m still sometimes skeptical about the utility of sub-genre labels. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the digitisation of music, and particularly the advent of MP3s, brought about a previously unthinkable explosion in access to music, and thus any barriers previously gating exposure to even the most esoteric of sounds, evaporated. There’s a strong argument to be made, that a generation of musicians has now grown up entirely in a culture where every shade and strain of music enjoyed a level playing field. Yes, certain flavours of pop, hip-hop etc. still have the largest marketing budgets, and the most FM airplay. But, it’s only a matter of turning on one’s laptop or phone to access a whole world of sound. My thesis here — which I’m admittedly presenting solely on the basis of personal observation — is that sub-genres (and, arguably, genres themselves to an increasing extent) mean less now than they ever have, because an increasing number of artists feel free to ignore them, or work across them.\n\nDepending on the whim of the staff, you might find Mall Grab’s debut LP in either the Dance, Electronic, or Techno sections of your local record store. First track ‘Hand in Hand Through Wonderland’ is a trance-adjascent piece centred on a pretty, chiming keyboard run, before ‘I Can Remember It So Vividly’ snatches the baton, and sprints with it. ‘Love Reigns’ is more-or-less straight house, with euphoric piano. Then, Turnstile’s Brendan Yates shows up to provide both screaming & soothing vocals on ‘Understand’ — a track which otherwise sounds more like Bicep. That’s a run down of less than 1/3 of the record, and I’m already dizzy. What follows touches neo-soul, grime, and pure club sounds, before late highlight ‘Metaphysical’ — a mélange of techno breakbeats and ominous synths — and ‘Lost in Harajuku’ ring things out more subtly.\n\nAll of which sounds as though the record could be an un-coordinated, directionless mess. Whatever magic Jordon Alexander is working in the tight production helps tie the thing together, and made it a giddily enjoyable experience for me from first spin.\n\n### 11. Amber Mark — *Three Dimensions Deep*\n\nReleased on 28 January, this debut LP from R&B / soul singer-songwriter Amber Mark is the longest standing record on this list. Since I first heard the opening salvo of ‘One’, eleven months ago, this was a strong contender, and it has only grown on me over time. The immediate allure was in poppier moments like the aforementioned ‘One’, on which Mark both sings soulfully and sing-raps her struggle with anger and insecurity. Follow-up ‘What It Is’ only further established this record's many gifts: a bold neo-soul slide which makes the most of Mark's impressive voice by layering it into the smoothest possible harmonies. The soulful ‘Most Men’ completes an opening trinity as strong as it is varied. But we're only getting started. ’Healing Hurts’ cuts an R&B ballad with a pseudo-trap beat, for results far more compelling than that sounds; ‘Bubbles’ heads for the dance floor; elsewhere there are funk touches, blues samples, and lush string arrangements, all tied together by Mark's supremely polished songwriting, and velvet vocals. ‘Softly’ even samples turn-of-the-millennium Craig David to charming effect!\n\nBut the honeyed pop that drew me is really only the first layer of what proves to be a deeper record. Repeated listens reveal the extent to which Mark is telling a story across the hour running time. In a rough three act structure, she maps a journey through grief, towards acceptance. It’s easy to miss when you’re swaying to the funk arrangements of ‘Foreign Things’, or late highlight ‘Bliss’, but this is the most assured of debuts: musically and thematically vibrant and ambitious.\n\n### 10. Yeah Yeah Yeahs — *Cool It Down*\n\nA new Yeah Yeah Yeahs record was always going to get my attention. Their 2003 debut, *Fever to Tell*, was an absolutely central part of the vanguard of exciting records that defined the sound of rock music in the early 21st century (alongside fellow heavy hitters like The Strokes' *Is This It,* Kings of Leon’s *Youth & Young Manhood,* The White Stripes’ *White Blood Cells* etc.). In my estimation, follow-up *Show Your Bones* (2006) was not only better, but elevated to the pantheon of my favourite rock albums. It was third on my list that year, and has had more staying power for me in the years since than has proven true of the album immediately ahead of it: Thom Yorke’s *The Eraser* — a record I still play, but which I wouldn't consider myself passionate about.\n\nYYYs have certainly fallen off for me since: 2009’s *It’s Blitz* was pretty good (but notably not good enough for a list spot); 2013's *Mosquito* was largely forgettable — indeed, I don't think I’ve played it in the last 9 years. All of which makes *Cool It Down* the most pleasant of surprises.\n\nSurely it’s no coincidence that opener ’Spitting Off the Edge of the World’ sits atop the same drum beat that powered *Show Your Bones*' opener ‘Gold Lion’. Here, however, it is both slower and more muted in the mix: a more relaxed, less bombastic heartbeat for a new YYYs sound.\n\nAcross a lot of different releases this year I noted a version of this slowing, along with an increased interest in dreamier, gauzier sounds. Dream-pop tones coloured several albums I enjoyed in 2022, but which didn’t end up making this list: shouts to SRSQ’s *Ever Crashing*, Jockstrap's *I Love You Jennifer B*, and even Taylor Swift's *Midnights* — all of which are playing with these colours to some extent. Overall, however, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' implementation — which reaches back to elements of their sound that have existed since they first arrived — worked on me like magic. Yes, it may be classifiable as a crime to have Nick Zinner (a genuinely top-tier guitarist) hardly pick up a guitar on this album, but Karen O's vocal shines when surrounded by floating synths.\n\nI certainly wouldn’t object if, next year, they followed it up with half an hour of pure garage rock, but in the here and now, *Cool It Down* really is something pretty special.\n\n### 9. Duval Timothy — *Meeting With a Judas Tree*\n\nEarlier this year I found myself in a jazz rut, which in turn led me down a jazz rabbit hole. I had been enjoying *Opening* by the Tord Gustavsen Trio\\*, but no other 2022 releases had stuck for me. So, I started casting about for new sounds, and at some point my exploration landed upon the 2017 album *Sen Am*, by Duval Timothy — a startling construction of piano-first jazz, and ambience. I developed a mild obsession with the record's idiosyncrasies, playing it so much that, when Timothy's new LP arrived in November, I immediately found myself struck by both its similarities and its differences.\n\nFirst, the similarities. *Meeting With a Judas Tree* contains sections that read as direct responses, or otherwise continuations, of pieces from the five-year-old *Sen Am*. (It should be said, there are several releases in between, which I have not yet taken the time to adequately explore (beyond a cursory listen to Timothy's intriguing 2021 collaboration with pop / alternative singer-songwriter, Rosie Lowe), and so it's quite possible this is a musical conversation Duval Timothy has been carrying on *throughout* his work.) The four note sequences that underpin opener ‘Plunge’, feel unmistakably like an evolution of the refrain that plays the same role on *Sen Am*'s first track ‘Whatsapp’; the older album’s ‘Ibs’ is reflected and refracted here on ‘Up’ — its joyful central melody re-situated amidst layers of effects, and treated audio samples.\n\nThis is one of the differences: a deepening (in places) of layers; an increased incorporation of field recordings, and looped elements, present on *Sen Am* but given new shapes here. Timothy's own liner notes also speak to a variety of recording techniques. One, which I found interesting:\n\n> Recorded on different pianos, including an upright in Freetown that had lost the felt of its hammers due to the humidity creating a harpsichord-like sound as the raw wood hit the strings.\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) its relative delicacy, this was some of the most captivating music I heard all year, and certainly amongst the most beautiful. I was disappointed to miss the screenings of an accompanying short film at the ICA, but such mistakes are less likely to recur now that I’m officially hooked on every move Duval Timothy makes.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\\* indeed, it was one of the final shortlist of 35 records in contention for this list<span>\n\n### 8. Dusky — *Pressure*\n\nFrom memory, this may be the first straight-up garage record that has made one of these lists. I’ve certainly had albums from the dancier-end of the electronica spectrum before, but this is a thoroughbred. It’s *also* explicitly an exercise in revisiting an older sound, which is perfect for me as someone who remained largely oblivious to the charms of dance music until a decade into the 21st century.\n\nEven so, the primary building blocks here are now familiar to me: 2-step drum patterns, 4x4 rhythms, and playful use of vocal samples. The treated vocals and warping bass of ‘Northbound’ always inspires an increase in volume, and the (admittedly somewhat risible) vocal interjections on ‘Bubblin’’ never fail to bring a smile to my face. In fact, joy — more than anything else — is what I associate with this record. From the very first time I played it, dancing around my living room in the dark, it was a lock for this list. Its charms have not faded in the months since. When the bass kicks in on ‘Rollers’, followed by the vocal, and a chiming flourish that sounds like it could belong to a 16-bit *Sonic the Hedgehog* game, catch me vibing!\n\n### 7. Brainwaltzera — *ITSAME*\n\nHere, across 17 tracks and 74 minutes, the pseudonymous producer behind the Brainwaltzera alias lays out a banquet of sound which feels coherent and focussed despite its scope. *ITSAME* is defined by its meticulous arrangements of crisp, skittery beats and stuttering rhythms, and the interplay between those components and the frequent use of bright, warm chords.\n\nElements sit on a spectrum from the brief, light raindrops of ‘F1 Halo’, and the gentle melody atop ‘Morning Narcomnastics’, to the frenetic popcorn beat that rises and falls away on tracks like ‘A Star is Bored’ and ‘medal headz (G.B.D.F.)`. The record as a whole is a melting pot of styles and sounds, but in an arrangement that always feels as though it’s restlessly pushing for something new. Album highlight ‘Fwd: Re: late (Ref.: karoshi)’ is a six-minute simulacra of the LP: opening on moody chords, it introduces a tangle of synths, then an active, evolving percussive backbone. The wave crests with a moment of relative stillness, before the latter half reconsiders the relationships between now-familiar components. This is a generous and wide-ranging set of electronica with a playful sense of both space and density.\n\n### 6. Bonobo — *Fragments*\n\nOn his seventh LP for Ninja Tune, Simon Green has pulled together an exceptionally well-crafted array of low-key techno, as warm and inviting as almost any record I played this year.\n\nOpener ‘Polyghost’ is an introductory swell built from harp and strings, before the pulse of ‘Shadows’ arrives. That track showcases a tender vocal by Jordan Rakei atop a simple, clean percussion and continued strings. Elsewhere, ‘Otomo’ has some bombast, and makes admirable use of bagpipes — (like steel pan) an instrument I usually limit my exposure to when possible. ‘Age of Phase’ displays some urgency whilst underpinned by bright chords. ‘Tides’ is measured, whilst allowing Jamila Woods’ simple, honest, and expressive vocal room to breathe. And late highlight ‘Sapien’ brings in choppy synths and frenetic 90s percussion.\n\nThe album's composition is primarily subtle techno, with warm orchestral adornment, and down-tempo R&B accents. For me, it’s working in a similar space to SBTRKT’s *Wonder Where We’ll Land*, which took [third on my 2014 list](/list2014). Like that album, it's an immensely polished artefact, and — Apple Music informs me — my most-played album of 2022. Multiple tracks, such as ‘Rosewood’ — which exudes warmth & comfort — and ‘Elysian’ — a beautiful, characterful instrumental — conjure worlds of sound I gladly returned, time and again, to immerse myself in.\n\n### 5. Tove Lo — *Dirt Femme*\n\nNow here’s a record that immediately announced itself as a strong list contender from play number one. First track, ‘No One Dies From Love’, is one of the year’s best opening statements: an anthem awash with 80s-inspired synth tones, propulsive percussion, and striking, layered vocals. Then, Lo immediately complicates the emotional tone of the record by sequencing ‘Suburbia’ next: a darker flavour of pop, more forthright in tone, in which she rejects the natalist assumption that her new marriage will immediately result in children. Taken together, these two tracks serve as a good microcosm of an album that consistently finds Tove Lo exploring various aspects of her femininity, whilst — it should be made clear — having a lot of fun doing so.\n\nAlbum highlight ‘2 Die 4’ is centred around a goosebump-inducing interpolation of Gershon Kingsley’s ‘Popcorn’ (1969) — its an irresistible infusion of joyful trance, and one of my tracks of the year. Elsewhere ‘True Romance’ builds into one of 2022’s most stirring vocal performances; ‘Grapefruit’ is a vulnerable reflection on eating disorders, wrapped in more anthemic 80s synth; and ‘Cute & Cruel’ calls in assistance from First Aid Kit for a slice of grade-A folk balladry.\n\nSome reviews of the record lamented the fact that Lo’s first outing as an independent artist eschews much of the more overt, confrontationally sexual leanings of her output on four previous albums for a major label. (There is still a song (‘Pineapple Slice’) entirely about cunnilingus.) For me, there’s a sense that this is Lo feeling more mature, less pressed to court notoriety, and more firmly in control of what her music should sound like. The result is an embrace of throwback pop sounds, and a record that is both unflinchingly honest, and unfailingly fun.\n\n<font color=\"#cfcfcf\">Side note: I would like to take this space to note that my 21st-favourite record of 2022 is by another pansexual Swede named Tove. *HARD* by (<metaa>[2018 List alumna](/list2018)</metaa>) Tove Styrke represents one of the most heart-rending omissions in recent memory, particularly as it contains my undisputed song of the year: ‘Show Me Love’.</font>\n\n### 4. Black Thought & Danger Mouse — *Cheat Codes*\n\nDanger Mouse hit my radar in 2003: I had a lot of fun with *Ghetto Pop Life*, the album-length collaboration he did with Jemini, and I can still hear ‘The Only One’ in my head as I type this, despite having not played it in probably a decade or more. The following year, *The Grey Album* — his mash-up of Jay-Z's *The Black Album* (2003) with The Beatles' 1968 'white album' — was an 'acquire these MP3s by any means necessary' treat.\n\nBlack Thought I knew from his work with The Roots (2002’s *Phrenology* remains a favourite), but I was (shamefully) less familiar with his solo work.\n\nIn combination here, they’ve produced a soulful masterwork of low-key hip-hop. Danger Mouse’s beats pull from mid-century sounds — not just classic soul and funk, but psychedelia and progressive rock — lending the production a compelling off-kilter edge. Over this strange landscape of distorted organs, altered strings, and often muffled percussion, Black Thought delivers a masterclass in easy flow and scalpel-sharp wordplay.\n\nThere are variations in the production, such that opener ‘Sometimes’ and single ‘Aquamarine’ (which I *think* is sampling Garbage) feel expansive, whereas ‘Close to Famous’ feels like a straight-to-tape tirade as it rides an uneasy blues beat, and (another single) ‘No Gold Teeth’ is a close-quarters jam to a slice of highly-concentrated funk.\n\nFront to back, *Cheat Codes* is a rousing delight; the inclusion of a previously-unheard verse by MF DOOM, on ‘Belize’, is a cherry on top.\n\n### 3. Zella Day — *Sunday in Heaven*\n\nLet me start by saying that I have listened to this album innumerable times, and feel no closer to understanding what it means to “mushroom punch [one’s] way down the rabbit hole”, as Zella Day is planning on the opening track. What I *can* tell you, is that ‘Mushroom Punch’ is a giddy delight that starts as a finger-picked folk tune, before exploding into a piece of Sparks-style operatic pop, and which — a little more than two minutes in — takes a pause for a Bee Gees-esque disco break, replete with hazy synth. That's the opening track: one of the most thrilling pop songs I encountered all year.\n\nFrom there, we’re into ‘Am I Still Your Baby’, a self-assured slice of pop-rock on which Day allows her voice to somersault and soar, before sinking to a more intimate register. Then ‘Dance for Love’, which sounds like a lost 70s disco classic wrapped in sultry modern production.\n\nSomething that has become increasingly clear to me over the last few years, (and which may be apparent to the reader of this list) is that my favourite instrument — once the electric guitar — is now most-assuredly the female voice. There are captivating vocal passages on this record that bring to mind Kate Bush and Sinead O’Connor, as much as Lana Del Rey and Florence Welch. In combination with strong musical influences ranging from the golden-era of disco to straight-up country, it’s a record that may be confounding at first, but which has been endlessly fascinating and rewarding for me. From the emotional highs of ‘Golden’ (one album highlight among many) to the lower, but no less impassioned, ‘Last Time’, it’s a dizzying journey I grew increasingly comfortable with, and then found myself spellbound by.\n\n### 2. Buck 65 — *King of Drums*\n\nBack in the early 2000s, I had begun the process of expanding my hip-hop horizons beyond the Aftermath Records artists on MTV. I was lucky enough to make friends with a real hip-hop head: a guy whose room in our university halls of residence was messy with vinyl records and obscure kung-fu movies on DVD. At the slightest sign of interest from me, he started pushing this material my way like an eager cult leader, sensing the opportunity to recruit. I didn’t own a turntable, but through sessions sat on his floor I began to absorb Eric B & Rakim, Gang Starr, The Pharcyde, and many others. I count myself lucky to have had someone to raise the curtain for me a little, and show me what lay beyond my Dr Dre and Eminem CDs.\n\nShortly thereafter, poking around in the hip-hop section of some record store or another, I stumbled across a pair of albums: one called *Primitive Plus* (2002) by Edan, and the other titled *Square* (2002) by Buck 65. Together, these two albums exploded my conception of what hip-hop was, and what it could do. Edan only released one subsequent LP, but I picked up everything Buck 65 (aka Rich Terfry) put out for the next decade-plus. Until, that is, he released *Neverlove* in 2014, and subsequently went dark. His online presence evaporated, his website was taken down. Eventually I heard he was hosting a drive-time show on Canadian radio.\n\nAs the years stretched on, I had all but lost hope that we’d ever hear a note of new music from Buck 65 again. And yet, here we are. In 2020, Terfry collaborated with Controller 7 on a concept album based around the Vincent Gallo movie *Buffalo 66* (1998). Perhaps that relit the spark in him to make new music, because in 2022 he has been on a roll: digging in the vaults and putting up buried treasure on Bandcamp; a new collaborative LP with Tachichi; and a fascinating newsletter in which he has candidly laid out the story of his career. Most important of all though: a new Buck 65 record, which knocked my socks clean off the very first time I heard it. Old school production, absolutely *peerless* beat construction, and that familiar goofy flow spouting the weird and wonderful. It may have been eight years in the making, but my goodness the sheer amount of work and skill that has gone into it is stunning. Masterpiece — and easily his best since the record that completely spun my head two decades ago.\n\n### 1. Metric — *Formentera*\n\nEven amongst albums that I love, there are very few that I would call truly *flawless*. One of them is Metric’s 2012 LP *Synthetica* — 43 minutes of unimpeachable, razor-sharp, neon-infused synth-pop-rock; every one of its eleven tracks a gold-plated ★★★★★. That record placed [second on my 2012 list](/list2012), runner-up only to a resurgent Deftones' *Koi No Yokan* — I still enjoy that album a great deal, but there's no doubt that, at a decade's remove, those places would be switched. It's not even close.\n\nMetric made another top 5 appearance on my list in 2015, with *Pagans in Vegas*, but 2018's *Art of Doubt* (whilst enormously enjoyable) fell a little short for me at the time. All of which brings us to *Formentera*, which grabbed me with a steel-lined velvet fist upon release in July, and hasn't loosened its grip.\n\nFrom 10 minute opening epic ‘Doomscroller’ (which feels like three great songs in one, and embarrasses Arcade Fire at their own game of digital-era, humans-before-technology operatic angst), to the sun-kissed, elegiac closer ‘Paths in the Sky’ (Emily Haines’ voice trampolining up above the burbling bass-line), this is an album of exceptional vision and craft. In between, there’s the darkly joyous ‘All Comes Crashing’, the blissfuly dreamy title track, and the riotous, infectious album highlight ‘False Dichotomy’ — one of the year’s most goosebump-inducing songs, even on the 50th listen.\n\nWhisper it, but, this might just be their best record.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about the concept of difficulty in art, and how it applies differently across media — how we <em>mean</em> different things by the word, depending on what we&rsquo;re applying the label to.</p>\n<p>The spark for this line of thinking is usually encountering a particularly hard section, or element, of a video game. In games — and, specifically, PvE (player vs environment) games — the person with the controller in their hands pits their wits, reactions, and sometimes temperament, against the game itself. At a very basic level, progress through the game is measured in successful actions taken. Bopped an enemy on the head? That&rsquo;s a little bit of progress. Collected a coin? That&rsquo;s progress. Reached the end of a level? Progress.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a very reductive way of thinking about it, and there are uncountable different ways in which these variables can be altered by the game designer, but regardless, the heart of games is that <strong>progress is attained through player action</strong>.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the case in any other artistic medium.

				"content_text": "I've been thinking for a while about the concept of difficulty in art, and how it applies differently across media — how we *mean* different things by the word, depending on what we're applying the label to. \n\nThe spark for this line of thinking is usually encountering a particularly hard section, or element, of a video game. In games — and, specifically, PvE (player vs environment) games — the person with the controller in their hands pits their wits, reactions, and sometimes temperament, against the game itself. At a very basic level, progress through the game is measured in successful actions taken. Bopped an enemy on the head? That's a little bit of progress. Collected a coin? That's progress. Reached the end of a level? Progress.\n\nThat's a very reductive way of thinking about it, and there are uncountable different ways in which these variables can be altered by the game designer, but regardless, the heart of games is that **progress is attained through player action**. \n\nThis isn’t the case in any other artistic medium. Nothing is required of the listener for a song, or even a whole symphony, to play out and conclude. I can attest from personal experience that films and television shows will run uninhibited before even the most disinterested viewer.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-tyler-the-creator--call-me-if-you-get-lost\">20. Tyler, The Creator — <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em></h3>\n<p>Tyler hit 12th on my 2019 list with <em>IGOR</em>, an album that captivated and confounded me in equal measure, with its structural inventiveness. That was a poppier affair than we&rsquo;re in for this time out — <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em> is more interested in putting a spin on various rap sub-genres. Soul samples and R&amp;B textures ebb &amp; flow throughout another album-as-album exercise in layered production, restless structures, and tongue-in-cheek lifestyle boasting. Once again, Tyler made my favourite hip-hop LP of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-weezer--ok-human\">19. Weezer — <em>OK Human</em></h3>\n<p>Imagine if you were a member of a church, or a friend group or something, and over the years you&rsquo;d developed a bunch of rites or in jokes or whatever. If you were to try and bring a new person into that circle, they&rsquo;d meet a wall of resistance in the form of the very shared customs and understanding that you had been enjoying for years. Which is to say: I would not know where to begin if I was tasked with explaining Weezer&rsquo;s 2021 output to someone who hasn&rsquo;t been along for the ride with this band for at least two full decades.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I will say:</p>\n<p>a) <em>OK Human</em> is a sneaky complex album. It was introduced as the lockdown project the band put together in lieu of releasing and touring their love letter to metal: <em>Van Weezer</em>. In truth it&rsquo;s a pop-rock record with a freaking string section! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve encountered that since Silverchair tapped Van Dyke Parks as a collaborator in 2002.</p>\n<p>b) I wish this record had been released as a freakish Jekyll &amp; Hyde double-album with <em>Van Weezer</em>, so that I could find room for both of them on this list. On balance, this is the more consistently enjoyable of the two LPs, even if it&rsquo;s something like the band&rsquo;s sixth best record overall.</p>\n<p>c) The best track Weezer released this year (by a country mile) is &lsquo;Sheila Can Do It&rsquo;, which has been only lightly revised since <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k6rJxp6eDk8\">its 1997 demo version</a>. Take that for what you will.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-celeste--not-your-muse\">18. Celeste — <em>Not Your Muse</em></h3>\n<p>I was already infatuated with Celeste&rsquo;s debut by the time it was shortlisted for the 2021 Mercury Prize. Its sonic warmth and thematic vulnerability made for a valued companion throughout year two of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Ideal Woman&rsquo; is the gentlest beginning, and a perfect showcase for both the richness of Celeste&rsquo;s voice, and the candidness of her lyrics; &lsquo;Strange&rsquo; is an equally tender paean on loss, and then the album begins to open up to a larger sound. What follows is a set of soul and R&amp;B-inflected pop that never falters. The album&rsquo;s single strongest track is still probably the understated bombast of &lsquo;Love is Back&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s in good company right through to the touching declaration in &lsquo;A Little Love&rsquo;: &ldquo;Of all the things to be / I choose a kindness&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-ben-kweller--circuit-boredom\">17. Ben Kweller — <em>Circuit Boredom</em></h3>\n<p>A round of applause, please, for the first record I listened to this year! Released on 1 January, Kweller&rsquo;s sixth LP-shaped collection of rock-flavoured, pop-shaped confections as a solo artist has hung on effortlessly for twelve months to make this list. Eight songs and 28 minutes maybe pushes the boundaries of eligibility, but this is as note-perfect a piece of work as BK has released since his eponymous album 15 years ago. It contains all the flavours of Kweller that you know and love: pop stomper (opener &lsquo;Starz&rsquo;); vulnerable acoustic ballad ((part of) &lsquo;Just For Kids&rsquo;); &amp; lo-fi crunchy: on album high point &lsquo;Heart Attack Kid&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not already a fan, <em>Circuit Boredom</em> isn&rsquo;t going to change any minds. For the rest of us, however, your face is going to be hurting from smiling by the time you&rsquo;re singing along to &lsquo;Wanna Go Home&rsquo;&hellip; and then circling right back to play the record again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-ill-considered--liminal-space\">16. Ill Considered — <em>Liminal Space</em></h3>\n<p>Ill Considered are a hyper-prolific improvisational jazz ensemble. The aptly titled <em>Liminal Space</em> is the group&rsquo;s first recorded work to mix live performances with post-production elements. Here the central trio of saxophone, bass, and drums are artfully supplemented with additions from guest players, bringing a rich and full-bodied sound to initially improvised pieces.</p>\n<p>This is complex and high-paced music, with some tracks (eg. &lsquo;The Lurch&rsquo; and &lsquo;Light Trailed&rsquo;) featuring time signatures so complicated they can overwhelm. However, listening via headphones, and surrendering to the build and swell, I found few listening experiences more rewarding this year.</p>\n<p>(Side note: the album features one of the year&rsquo;s best covers, by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vincent.deboer/\">Dutch artist Vincent de Boer</a>.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-koreless--agor\">15. Koreless — <em>Agor</em></h3>\n<p>&lsquo;Yonder&rsquo; is an expanding bloom of a curtain raiser before the real action begins, and then it&rsquo;s off to the races for a half hour of dense electronica that plays masterfully with tension and release. There&rsquo;s a wide instrumental palate at play throughout, such as on &lsquo;White Picket Fence&rsquo;: built out of eerie synths, fuzzy bass keys, and a somersaulting set of vocal samples played as an instrument. Likewise &lsquo;Joy Squad&rsquo; makes use of dehumanised vocal stabs set amid a bed of alarming cinematic strings and skittering beats.</p>\n<p>Tracks often increase in intensity and complexity, pushing on when they feel almost like they should back off – but beyond these thresholds, Koreless often finds a place of euphoric calm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-bicep--isles\">14. Bicep — <em>Isles</em></h3>\n<p>The second LP from Northern Irish electronica twosome Bicep is an exercise in treading the line between headphones and the dance floor. For me it became a go-to AirPods-in record — its grooves (some trance, some more propulsive) lushly mixed and captivating throughout a varied tracklist. Drawing on a deep pool of samples, from Hindi bops to Turkish pop, Bicep weave a rich and ever-shifting sonic tapestry. Album highlight &lsquo;Apricots&rsquo; pulls together Bulgarian folk with a Malawian polyrhythmic vocal to astounding effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-japanese-breakfast--jubilee\">13. Japanese Breakfast — <em>Jubilee</em></h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a band that I feel bad about having paid too little attention to previously. Two albums (<em>Psychopop</em> (2016) &amp; <em>Soft Sounds From Another Planet</em> (2017)) have passed without me noticing, and it took — of all things — an exceptionally good video game soundtrack (for this autumn&rsquo;s low key, exploration-focussed coming-of-age game <em>Sable</em>) to really put Japanese Breakfast on my radar.</p>\n<p>I was only a couple of tracks into my first listen of <em>Jubilee</em> before I was almost literally kicking myself. Here was the soft-focussed, pastel-hued update to Bat For Lashes' sound that I hadn&rsquo;t realised I wanted. Ambitious, expansive pop music that is unafraid to experiment with weirder tonal inclusions.</p>\n<p>My former neglectfulness now corrected, band leader Michelle Zauner&rsquo;s memoir is even on my Kindle ready for holiday reading, and I will certainly be awaiting whatever comes next musically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-moin--moot\">12. Moin — <em>Moot!</em></h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an unexpected pleasure from the summer. <em>Moot!</em> is a strangely out-of-time artefact deeply reverent of 90s post-hardcore. Intense no matter which of its numerous gears it&rsquo;s operating in, it&rsquo;s the closest thing to Fugazi or Slint that I&rsquo;ve encountered in quite a while. &lsquo;Right is Alright, Wrong is to Belong&rsquo; is a haunting claustrophobic crawl, whereas &lsquo;Lungs&rsquo; is more animated, with wilder swings. Much of the album retains an almost live-seeming feel, owing to the record&rsquo;s few-frills production, which only adds to its Sub Pop-adjacent charms.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was an absolute pleasure to surrender time and again to the waves of distorted guitar, the inventive bass lines, and Valentina Magaletti&rsquo;s frenetic percussion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-ross-from-friends--tread\">11. Ross From Friends — <em>Tread</em></h3>\n<p>Felix Weatherall&rsquo;s trick to making his second record for Brainfeeder was to write an additional piece of bespoke software that sat on his laptop and just began recording automatically when his compositions met certain parameters. This method, implemented to overcome procrastination and choice paralysis, has resulted in a diverse set of electronica that hangs together remarkably well despite the swings from track-to-track. &lsquo;Revellers&rsquo; starts from a pure house foundation and builds something deep and sprawling; &lsquo;Morning Sun in a Dusty Room&rsquo; is a three-minute slice of glowing ambience; and &lsquo;Life in a Mind&rsquo; takes a soul sample for a kinetic trip punctuated by a brief, affecting melancholy dip.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-vijay-iyer-linda-may-han-oh--tyshawn-sorey--uneasy\">10. Vijay Iyer, Linda May Han Oh, &amp; Tyshawn Sorey — <em>Uneasy</em></h3>\n<p>Earlier in the year I found myself returning repeatedly to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/L_XJ_s5IsQc\">same video</a> of Snarky Puppy performing their 10 minute opus &lsquo;Lingus&rsquo; to a stunned studio audience. And, whilst Cory Henry&rsquo;s keyboard solo is undoubtedly the showpiece, I became fascinated by the drumming of Larnell Lewis. This sent me on a bit of a jazz drumming journey in the middle part of the year, and I found <em>Uneasy</em> at exactly the right time to get hypnotised by Tyshawn Sorey&rsquo;s intricate, constantly surprising work.</p>\n<p>Alongside Sorey here are longtime collaborator Linda May Han Oh on bass, and Iyer at the piano. Each is an extraordinary player, and the combination feels natural and marvellous. This may be their first record together, but I certainly hope it&rsquo;s not the last. The trio has fast become one of my very favourite configurations for jazz, precisely because of the way it allows for both interplay and the spotlighting of individual excellence. A few of the tracks here have been reworked from compositions originally for sextets or even string orchestras, and the increased intimacy is something I really valued: the opportunity to spend time with each of the exceptional players within the frameworks of these spacious arrangements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-st-vincent--daddys-home\">9. St. Vincent — <em>Daddy&rsquo;s Home</em></h3>\n<p>An artist as restlessly inventive as Annie Clark was never likely to settle for making more of the same. So, <em>Daddy&rsquo;s Home</em> heralds a new look, a new persona, and a new sound. A very definite 90-degree turn from <em>Masseduction</em> (6th in 2017), here 70s synth tones colour the album&rsquo;s experiments with soul, blues, and even hints at psychedelia (&lsquo;Live in the Dream&rsquo;). But, as always, Clark&rsquo;s treading her own path through these pastures. &lsquo;The Melting of the Sun&rsquo; manages to be both melancholy and unsettling, interweaved with a stirring soul background vocal. &lsquo;Down&rsquo; borrows the vocal progression from Nirvana&rsquo;s &lsquo;You Know You&rsquo;re Right&rsquo;, and transplants it into a funk-rock setting. And &lsquo;My Baby Wants a Baby&rsquo; is a brilliant, cutting, tongue-in-cheek update to Sheena Easton’s Prozac-happy 1980 anthem to obedient housewifery: ‘Morning Train (Nine to Five)’.</p>\n<p>Clark remains consistently one of the artists I&rsquo;m most fascinated by. I haven&rsquo;t yet got around to the recently-released documentary / horror movie (?) <em>The Nowhere Inn</em>, but I&rsquo;ve every faith it&rsquo;s a continuation of her ceaseless playing with persona and form. I will happily follow wherever she chooses to go next.</p>\n<p>Side note: this record also brings producer Jack Antonoff back to my list for the forth year out of the last five. Varied as the sounds have been across his projects with St Vincent and Taylor Swift, he&rsquo;s reaching the status of producer whose name alone will make me try a record.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-halsey--if-i-cant-have-love-i-want-power\">8. Halsey — <em>If I Can&rsquo;t Have Love, I Want Power</em></h3>\n<p>When Halsey hit second spot on my list last year, it was with an emo / pop-rock album peppered with outside influences: folk, R&amp;B, Korean rap&hellip;. It was a curious mix that worked supremely well on me, but certainly left me perplexed as to what a follow-up would sound like. I would not have predicted the menacing, polygenre tour-de-force that this collaboration with Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross has yielded.</p>\n<p>At heart Halsey has described the record as a concept album about the beauty and horror of pregnancy and birth. Many of their lyrics have a destructive bent, even when fascinated by acts of love and creation. Tender vocals over a sea of dark synths; a mélange of hopes and fears. It&rsquo;s a tension that makes for a record constantly wrestling with itself, content only to keep moving forward and growing as it goes.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Easier Than Lying&rsquo; would be at home on a Grimes record, and &lsquo;Girl is a Gun&rsquo; (with its hyperkinetic breakbeat) could be a lost Robyn classic. Over here we have Lindsay Buckingham fingerpicking guitar on the simple, beautiful &lsquo;Darling&rsquo;. Two tracks later, here&rsquo;s Dave Grohl providing drums for the bittersweet straight-ahead rock of &lsquo;Honey&rsquo;. More than three months since the album&rsquo;s release, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how it works as well as it does. Like <em>Manic</em> the recipe and the dynamics at play are a mystery, but the results are inarguable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-madlib--sound-ancestors\">7. Madlib — <em>Sound Ancestors</em></h3>\n<p>When MF DOOM passed toward the end of 2020, I found myself returning to one record in particular: 2004&rsquo;s <em>Madvillainy</em> colab between the late rapper and producer Madlib. In turn I had originally come to that record primarily via a 2005 EP of remixes by Four Tet. So, it felt like a circle completing itself in some way, to tune into <em>Sound Ancestors</em>. Here Kieran Hebden is on editing &amp; arranging duties, and the result is a constantly shifting soundscape of beats and interweaving vocal samples.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to nearly enough instrumental hip-hop, with my most prominent touchstone being J Dilla&rsquo;s 2006 LP <em>Donuts</em> – a record I considered during last year&rsquo;s  effort to figure out my all time favourite albums. There&rsquo;s a nod to Dilla here (on &lsquo;Two For 2&rsquo;), and the highest compliment I can pay <em>Sound Ancestors</em> is that it&rsquo;s operating in the same rarefied air as that masterpiece.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-jade-bird--different-kinds-of-light\">6. Jade Bird — <em>Different Kinds of Light</em></h3>\n<p>I had been so impatient for a follow-up to Jade Bird&rsquo;s debut (2nd place on my list in 2019) that the universe decided to play a trick on me. Like many artists, her entire tour was postponed multiple times throughout the pandemic, including the shows to which I had tickets. My disappointment at missing my opportunity to see how she does it live was alleviated, however, when she scheduled a series of intimate album launch shows – one of them a literal three minute walk from my front door. That show, which was simply Bird solo with an acoustic guitar, proved beyond any doubt that she is the genuine article.</p>\n<p>The self-titled debut album was <em>so</em> good that I had all but convinced myself it was impossible to follow up. In that respect, <em>Different Kinds of Light</em> proved me entirely wrong in the best way possible. Not only are there multiple songs here every bit as captivating as the cream of the first record, there&rsquo;s also an admirable sense of Bird expanding her sound – exploring further some of the avenues of country and Americana that the first record hinted at. Best song on the record? Pick anything beginning with an &lsquo;H&rsquo; and I won&rsquo;t argue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-low--hey-what\">5. Low — <em>Hey What</em></h3>\n<p>Back when I gave Low 6th place on my 2018 list, for <em>Double Negative</em>, I remarked upon my ignorance of the band&rsquo;s substantial back catalogue, and suggested that it was an error I should fix. Well, I am ashamed to admit that I have not done that work.

The interplay between Mimi Parker &amp; Alan Sparhawk (who are also married) is the band&rsquo;s defining strength however, particularly their exceptional vocal harmonies, which retain the power to soothe and stir even when under several layers of detuned, distorted cacophony.</p>\n<p>Maybe a second truly exceptional album in a row will finally push me to go back and explore three decades of output. There&rsquo;s every chance Low could turn out to be one of my favourite bands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bachelor--doomin-sun\">4. Bachelor — <em>Doomin' Sun</em></h3>\n<p>Jay Som took top spot on my 2017 list for the exemplary lo-fi bedroom pop album <em>Everybody Works</em>; and Palehound I (shamefully) have no prior familiarity with. As such, I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to expect when coming to their collaboration: Bachelor. What I found was a half hour of subtle but raw interrogations of the complex textures of love between women. The sonic palate is less synth and a little more guitar-centric than Jay Som&rsquo;s solo work, but it&rsquo;s still operating in largely the same spaces as I found so magnetic from <em>Everybody Works</em> &amp; <em>Turn Into</em> (2016).</p>\n<p>Above all, this project appears brimming with the energy of two likeminded musical souls, effortlessly complementing one another in telling shared stories. &lsquo;Back of My Hand&rsquo; is a declaration of admiration, powerful despite its relaxed flow. &lsquo;Sick of Spiralling&rsquo; is, in some respects, that song&rsquo;s flipside: fuelled by fear as well as love. To my mind though, the album&rsquo;s high point is the Pixies-meets-That Dog blur and buzz of &lsquo;Stay in the Car&rsquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-priya-ragu--damnshestamil\">3. Priya Ragu — <em>damnshestamil</em></h3>\n<p>Thought and prayers to anyone who has to decide how to file this record by category. Opener &lsquo;Leaf High&rsquo; — as well as being an introduction to Ragu&rsquo;s soaring, honeyed voice — is an exemplary piece of low key soul with a hip-hop inflection. It also contains a lyric referencing &ldquo;paper planes&rdquo;, which I couldn&rsquo;t help but read as a sly nod to Maya Arulpragasam — aka MIA — with whom Ragu has in common both Tamil heritage and musical eclecticism.</p>\n<p>Three minute pop gem &lsquo;Good Love 2.0&rsquo; has song-of-the-summer energy, and &lsquo;Lockdown&rsquo; is an infectious mix of R&amp;B and hip-hop across a South Asian-inflected beat. It shifts between adamant and euphoric with ease, an admirable trick that is also at work on one of the record&rsquo;s several highlights: &lsquo;Chicken Lemon Rice&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Forgot About&rsquo; is a straight-ahead R&amp;B ballad of exceptional quality. Here, as elsewhere, some of Ragu&rsquo;s choices of vocal inflections remind me of no one more strongly than Janet Jackson – a comparison I do not make lightly. I am excited to see where she goes after a debut like this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-turnstile--glow-on\">2. Turnstile — <em>Glow On</em></h3>\n<p>The number of guitar bands that excite me has certainly waned over the last decade or so, but alongside Biffy Clyro and a resurgent Deftones, Turnstile prove here that there&rsquo;s still plenty of life in the scene if you know where to find it. I certainly did not expect to be making <em>two</em> comparisons to Fugazi when writing this year&rsquo;s list, but just like with Moin, it&rsquo;s the Washington legends' influence that I hear as coal to Turnstile&rsquo;s roaring fire.</p>\n<p>Turnstile&rsquo;s update to hardcore, however, is inflected with synth atmospherics and an armload of borrowings from other genres. It actively rejects hardcore&rsquo;s (often misguided) reputation for self-seriousness, partly by unashamedly embracing anthemics, whilst retaining the source material&rsquo;s commitment to volume and enthusiasm. <em>Glow On</em> is an exercise in loud, direct sincerity distilled into concentrated sub-three minute bursts of whatever-works rock.</p>\n<p>PS. hearing guest Dev Hynes in a hardcore setting sent me back to Test Icicles' <em>For Screening Purposes</em> (14th on my list in 2005), and it&rsquo;s still a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-olivia-rodrigo--sour\">1. Olivia Rodrigo — <em>SOUR</em></h3>\n<p>Olivia has experienced a break-up, and her former boyfriend is now with someone else. This very specific scenario is the impetus behind at least seven songs on <em>SOUR</em>, making it a kind of concept album about a heartbreak tinged with feelings of anger and inadequacy.</p>\n<p>Some of the guest writing credits give a hint of the sonic palate. Hayley Williams helps inject some Paramore power-pop into &lsquo;Good 4 U&rsquo;, and Taylor Swift&rsquo;s recent sensibilities are evident on &lsquo;1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back&rsquo;: a fragile piano ballad of surpassing beauty. Then there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Deja Vu&rsquo;, as powerfully self-assured as it is potently infused with bitterness — tellingly it was written by the superhero team-up of Rodrigo, Swift, and Annie Clark.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, there is not a weak song here, and there are several that are truly world class; perhaps the best of all is the achingly vulnerable, yet steel-spined, &lsquo;Traitor&rsquo;. Unimpeachable song of the year material.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, nothing can compete when a three minute pop gem goes off in my chest like a cherry bomb, and this year Olivia Rodrigo came armed to the teeth.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n### 20. Tyler, The Creator — *Call Me If You Get Lost*\n\nTyler hit 12th on my 2019 list with *IGOR*, an album that captivated and confounded me in equal measure, with its structural inventiveness. That was a poppier affair than we're in for this time out — *Call Me If You Get Lost* is more interested in putting a spin on various rap sub-genres. Soul samples and R&B textures ebb & flow throughout another album-as-album exercise in layered production, restless structures, and tongue-in-cheek lifestyle boasting. Once again, Tyler made my favourite hip-hop LP of the year. \n\n### 19. Weezer — *OK Human*\n\nImagine if you were a member of a church, or a friend group or something, and over the years you'd developed a bunch of rites or in jokes or whatever. If you were to try and bring a new person into that circle, they'd meet a wall of resistance in the form of the very shared customs and understanding that you had been enjoying for years. Which is to say: I would not know where to begin if I was tasked with explaining Weezer's 2021 output to someone who hasn't been along for the ride with this band for at least two full decades. \n\nHere's what I will say: \n\na) *OK Human* is a sneaky complex album. It was introduced as the lockdown project the band put together in lieu of releasing and touring their love letter to metal: *Van Weezer*. In truth it's a pop-rock record with a freaking string section! I don't think I've encountered that since Silverchair tapped Van Dyke Parks as a collaborator in 2002. \n\nb) I wish this record had been released as a freakish Jekyll & Hyde double-album with *Van Weezer*, so that I could find room for both of them on this list. On balance, this is the more consistently enjoyable of the two LPs, even if it's something like the band's sixth best record overall. \n\nc) The best track Weezer released this year (by a country mile) is 'Sheila Can Do It', which has been only lightly revised since [its 1997 demo version](https://youtu.be/k6rJxp6eDk8). Take that for what you will. \n\n### 18. Celeste — *Not Your Muse*\n\nI was already infatuated with Celeste's debut by the time it was shortlisted for the 2021 Mercury Prize. Its sonic warmth and thematic vulnerability made for a valued companion throughout year two of the pandemic.  \n\n'Ideal Woman' is the gentlest beginning, and a perfect showcase for both the richness of Celeste's voice, and the candidness of her lyrics; 'Strange' is an equally tender paean on loss, and then the album begins to open up to a larger sound. What follows is a set of soul and R&B-inflected pop that never falters. The album's single strongest track is still probably the understated bombast of 'Love is Back', but it's in good company right through to the touching declaration in 'A Little Love': \"Of all the things to be / I choose a kindness\". \n\n### 17. Ben Kweller — *Circuit Boredom*\n\nA round of applause, please, for the first record I listened to this year! Released on 1 January, Kweller's sixth LP-shaped collection of rock-flavoured, pop-shaped confections as a solo artist has hung on effortlessly for twelve months to make this list. Eight songs and 28 minutes maybe pushes the boundaries of eligibility, but this is as note-perfect a piece of work as BK has released since his eponymous album 15 years ago. It contains all the flavours of Kweller that you know and love: pop stomper (opener 'Starz'); vulnerable acoustic ballad ((part of) 'Just For Kids'); & lo-fi crunchy: on album high point 'Heart Attack Kid'. \n\nIf you're not already a fan, *Circuit Boredom* isn't going to change any minds. For the rest of us, however, your face is going to be hurting from smiling by the time you're singing along to 'Wanna Go Home'... and then circling right back to play the record again. \t\n\n### 16. Ill Considered — *Liminal Space*\n\nIll Considered are a hyper-prolific improvisational jazz ensemble. The aptly titled *Liminal Space* is the group's first recorded work to mix live performances with post-production elements. Here the central trio of saxophone, bass, and drums are artfully supplemented with additions from guest players, bringing a rich and full-bodied sound to initially improvised pieces. \n\nThis is complex and high-paced music, with some tracks (eg. 'The Lurch' and 'Light Trailed') featuring time signatures so complicated they can overwhelm. However, listening via headphones, and surrendering to the build and swell, I found few listening experiences more rewarding this year. \n\n(Side note: the album features one of the year's best covers, by [Dutch artist Vincent de Boer](https://www.instagram.com/vincent.deboer/).)\n\n### 15. Koreless — *Agor*\n\n'Yonder' is an expanding bloom of a curtain raiser before the real action begins, and then it's off to the races for a half hour of dense electronica that plays masterfully with tension and release. There's a wide instrumental palate at play throughout, such as on 'White Picket Fence': built out of eerie synths, fuzzy bass keys, and a somersaulting set of vocal samples played as an instrument. Likewise 'Joy Squad' makes use of dehumanised vocal stabs set amid a bed of alarming cinematic strings and skittering beats. \n\nTracks often increase in intensity and complexity, pushing on when they feel almost like they should back off – but beyond these thresholds, Koreless often finds a place of euphoric calm. \n\n### 14. Bicep — *Isles* \n\nThe second LP from Northern Irish electronica twosome Bicep is an exercise in treading the line between headphones and the dance floor. For me it became a go-to AirPods-in record — its grooves (some trance, some more propulsive) lushly mixed and captivating throughout a varied tracklist. Drawing on a deep pool of samples, from Hindi bops to Turkish pop, Bicep weave a rich and ever-shifting sonic tapestry. Album highlight 'Apricots' pulls together Bulgarian folk with a Malawian polyrhythmic vocal to astounding effect. \n\n### 13. Japanese Breakfast — *Jubilee* \n\nHere's a band that I feel bad about having paid too little attention to previously. Two albums (*Psychopop* (2016) & *Soft Sounds From Another Planet* (2017)) have passed without me noticing, and it took — of all things — an exceptionally good video game soundtrack (for this autumn's low key, exploration-focussed coming-of-age game *Sable*) to really put Japanese Breakfast on my radar. \n\nI was only a couple of tracks into my first listen of *Jubilee* before I was almost literally kicking myself. Here was the soft-focussed, pastel-hued update to Bat For Lashes' sound that I hadn't realised I wanted. Ambitious, expansive pop music that is unafraid to experiment with weirder tonal inclusions. \n\nMy former neglectfulness now corrected, band leader Michelle Zauner's memoir is even on my Kindle ready for holiday reading, and I will certainly be awaiting whatever comes next musically. \n\n### 12. Moin — *Moot!*\n\nHere's an unexpected pleasure from the summer. *Moot!* is a strangely out-of-time artefact deeply reverent of 90s post-hardcore. Intense no matter which of its numerous gears it's operating in, it's the closest thing to Fugazi or Slint that I've encountered in quite a while. 'Right is Alright, Wrong is to Belong' is a haunting claustrophobic crawl, whereas 'Lungs' is more animated, with wilder swings. Much of the album retains an almost live-seeming feel, owing to the record's few-frills production, which only adds to its Sub Pop-adjacent charms.\n\nOverall, it was an absolute pleasure to surrender time and again to the waves of distorted guitar, the inventive bass lines, and Valentina Magaletti's frenetic percussion. \n\n### 11. Ross From Friends — *Tread*\n\nFelix Weatherall's trick to making his second record for Brainfeeder was to write an additional piece of bespoke software that sat on his laptop and just began recording automatically when his compositions met certain parameters. This method, implemented to overcome procrastination and choice paralysis, has resulted in a diverse set of electronica that hangs together remarkably well despite the swings from track-to-track. 'Revellers' starts from a pure house foundation and builds something deep and sprawling; 'Morning Sun in a Dusty Room' is a three-minute slice of glowing ambience; and 'Life in a Mind' takes a soul sample for a kinetic trip punctuated by a brief, affecting melancholy dip. \n\n### 10. Vijay Iyer, Linda May Han Oh, & Tyshawn Sorey — *Uneasy*\n\nEarlier in the year I found myself returning repeatedly to the [same video](https://youtu.be/L_XJ_s5IsQc) of Snarky Puppy performing their 10 minute opus 'Lingus' to a stunned studio audience. And, whilst Cory Henry's keyboard solo is undoubtedly the showpiece, I became fascinated by the drumming of Larnell Lewis. This sent me on a bit of a jazz drumming journey in the middle part of the year, and I found *Uneasy* at exactly the right time to get hypnotised by Tyshawn Sorey's intricate, constantly surprising work. \n\nAlongside Sorey here are longtime collaborator Linda May Han Oh on bass, and Iyer at the piano. Each is an extraordinary player, and the combination feels natural and marvellous. This may be their first record together, but I certainly hope it's not the last. The trio has fast become one of my very favourite configurations for jazz, precisely because of the way it allows for both interplay and the spotlighting of individual excellence. A few of the tracks here have been reworked from compositions originally for sextets or even string orchestras, and the increased intimacy is something I really valued: the opportunity to spend time with each of the exceptional players within the frameworks of these spacious arrangements. \n\n### 9. St. Vincent — *Daddy's Home*\n\nAn artist as restlessly inventive as Annie Clark was never likely to settle for making more of the same. So, *Daddy's Home* heralds a new look, a new persona, and a new sound. A very definite 90-degree turn from *Masseduction* (6th in 2017), here 70s synth tones colour the album's experiments with soul, blues, and even hints at psychedelia ('Live in the Dream'). But, as always, Clark's treading her own path through these pastures. 'The Melting of the Sun' manages to be both melancholy and unsettling, interweaved with a stirring soul background vocal. 'Down' borrows the vocal progression from Nirvana's 'You Know You're Right', and transplants it into a funk-rock setting. And 'My Baby Wants a Baby' is a brilliant, cutting, tongue-in-cheek update to Sheena Easton’s Prozac-happy 1980 anthem to obedient housewifery: ‘Morning Train (Nine to Five)’. \n\nClark remains consistently one of the artists I'm most fascinated by. I haven't yet got around to the recently-released documentary / horror movie (?) *The Nowhere Inn*, but I've every faith it's a continuation of her ceaseless playing with persona and form. I will happily follow wherever she chooses to go next. \n\nSide note: this record also brings producer Jack Antonoff back to my list for the forth year out of the last five. Varied as the sounds have been across his projects with St Vincent and Taylor Swift, he's reaching the status of producer whose name alone will make me try a record. \n\n### 8. Halsey — *If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power*\n\nWhen Halsey hit second spot on my list last year, it was with an emo / pop-rock album peppered with outside influences: folk, R&B, Korean rap.... It was a curious mix that worked supremely well on me, but certainly left me perplexed as to what a follow-up would sound like. I would not have predicted the menacing, polygenre tour-de-force that this collaboration with Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross has yielded. \n\nAt heart Halsey has described the record as a concept album about the beauty and horror of pregnancy and birth. Many of their lyrics have a destructive bent, even when fascinated by acts of love and creation. Tender vocals over a sea of dark synths; a mélange of hopes and fears. It's a tension that makes for a record constantly wrestling with itself, content only to keep moving forward and growing as it goes.  \n\n'Easier Than Lying' would be at home on a Grimes record, and 'Girl is a Gun' (with its hyperkinetic breakbeat) could be a lost Robyn classic. Over here we have Lindsay Buckingham fingerpicking guitar on the simple, beautiful 'Darling'. Two tracks later, here's Dave Grohl providing drums for the bittersweet straight-ahead rock of 'Honey'. More than three months since the album's release, I'm still trying to figure out how it works as well as it does. Like *Manic* the recipe and the dynamics at play are a mystery, but the results are inarguable. \n\n### 7. Madlib — *Sound Ancestors*\n\nWhen MF DOOM passed toward the end of 2020, I found myself returning to one record in particular: 2004's *Madvillainy* colab between the late rapper and producer Madlib. In turn I had originally come to that record primarily via a 2005 EP of remixes by Four Tet. So, it felt like a circle completing itself in some way, to tune into *Sound Ancestors*. Here Kieran Hebden is on editing & arranging duties, and the result is a constantly shifting soundscape of beats and interweaving vocal samples.\n\nI don't listen to nearly enough instrumental hip-hop, with my most prominent touchstone being J Dilla's 2006 LP *Donuts* – a record I considered during last year's  effort to figure out my all time favourite albums. There's a nod to Dilla here (on 'Two For 2'), and the highest compliment I can pay *Sound Ancestors* is that it's operating in the same rarefied air as that masterpiece.\n\n### 6. Jade Bird — *Different Kinds of Light*\n\nI had been so impatient for a follow-up to Jade Bird's debut (2nd place on my list in 2019) that the universe decided to play a trick on me. Like many artists, her entire tour was postponed multiple times throughout the pandemic, including the shows to which I had tickets. My disappointment at missing my opportunity to see how she does it live was alleviated, however, when she scheduled a series of intimate album launch shows – one of them a literal three minute walk from my front door. That show, which was simply Bird solo with an acoustic guitar, proved beyond any doubt that she is the genuine article. \n\nThe self-titled debut album was *so* good that I had all but convinced myself it was impossible to follow up. In that respect, *Different Kinds of Light* proved me entirely wrong in the best way possible. Not only are there multiple songs here every bit as captivating as the cream of the first record, there's also an admirable sense of Bird expanding her sound – exploring further some of the avenues of country and Americana that the first record hinted at. Best song on the record? Pick anything beginning with an 'H' and I won't argue. \n\n### 5. Low — *Hey What*\n\nBack when I gave Low 6th place on my 2018 list, for *Double Negative*, I remarked upon my ignorance of the band's substantial back catalogue, and suggested that it was an error I should fix. Well, I am ashamed to admit that I have not done that work. Instead, I waited until *Hey What* came out this September, to experience all over again the shocking power of their brand of colossal-sounding, meditatively paced rock. \n\nFor this recording at least, the band is now down to a duo (bassist Steve Garrington having departed last year). The interplay between Mimi Parker & Alan Sparhawk (who are also married) is the band's defining strength however, particularly their exceptional vocal harmonies, which retain the power to soothe and stir even when under several layers of detuned, distorted cacophony. \n\nMaybe a second truly exceptional album in a row will finally push me to go back and explore three decades of output. There's every chance Low could turn out to be one of my favourite bands.\n\n### 4. Bachelor — *Doomin' Sun*\n\nJay Som took top spot on my 2017 list for the exemplary lo-fi bedroom pop album *Everybody Works*; and Palehound I (shamefully) have no prior familiarity with. As such, I didn't know exactly what to expect when coming to their collaboration: Bachelor. What I found was a half hour of subtle but raw interrogations of the complex textures of love between women. The sonic palate is less synth and a little more guitar-centric than Jay Som's solo work, but it's still operating in largely the same spaces as I found so magnetic from *Everybody Works* & *Turn Into* (2016). \n\nAbove all, this project appears brimming with the energy of two likeminded musical souls, effortlessly complementing one another in telling shared stories. 'Back of My Hand' is a declaration of admiration, powerful despite its relaxed flow. 'Sick of Spiralling' is, in some respects, that song's flipside: fuelled by fear as well as love. To my mind though, the album's high point is the Pixies-meets-That Dog blur and buzz of 'Stay in the Car'. \n\n### 3. Priya Ragu — *damnshestamil*\n\nThought and prayers to anyone who has to decide how to file this record by category. Opener 'Leaf High' — as well as being an introduction to Ragu's soaring, honeyed voice — is an exemplary piece of low key soul with a hip-hop inflection. It also contains a lyric referencing \"paper planes\", which I couldn't help but read as a sly nod to Maya Arulpragasam — aka MIA — with whom Ragu has in common both Tamil heritage and musical eclecticism. \n\nThree minute pop gem 'Good Love 2.0' has song-of-the-summer energy, and 'Lockdown' is an infectious mix of R&B and hip-hop across a South Asian-inflected beat. It shifts between adamant and euphoric with ease, an admirable trick that is also at work on one of the record's several highlights: 'Chicken Lemon Rice'. \n\n'Forgot About' is a straight-ahead R&B ballad of exceptional quality. Here, as elsewhere, some of Ragu's choices of vocal inflections remind me of no one more strongly than Janet Jackson – a comparison I do not make lightly. I am excited to see where she goes after a debut like this.\n\n### 2. Turnstile — *Glow On*\n\nThe number of guitar bands that excite me has certainly waned over the last decade or so, but alongside Biffy Clyro and a resurgent Deftones, Turnstile prove here that there's still plenty of life in the scene if you know where to find it. I certainly did not expect to be making *two* comparisons to Fugazi when writing this year's list, but just like with Moin, it's the Washington legends' influence that I hear as coal to Turnstile's roaring fire.\n\nTurnstile's update to hardcore, however, is inflected with synth atmospherics and an armload of borrowings from other genres. It actively rejects hardcore's (often misguided) reputation for self-seriousness, partly by unashamedly embracing anthemics, whilst retaining the source material's commitment to volume and enthusiasm. *Glow On* is an exercise in loud, direct sincerity distilled into concentrated sub-three minute bursts of whatever-works rock. \n\nPS. hearing guest Dev Hynes in a hardcore setting sent me back to Test Icicles' *For Screening Purposes* (14th on my list in 2005), and it's still a lot of fun. \n\n### 1. Olivia Rodrigo — *SOUR*\n\nOlivia has experienced a break-up, and her former boyfriend is now with someone else. This very specific scenario is the impetus behind at least seven songs on *SOUR*, making it a kind of concept album about a heartbreak tinged with feelings of anger and inadequacy.  \n\nSome of the guest writing credits give a hint of the sonic palate. Hayley Williams helps inject some Paramore power-pop into 'Good 4 U', and Taylor Swift's recent sensibilities are evident on '1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back': a fragile piano ballad of surpassing beauty.

Unimpeachable song of the year material. \n\nUltimately, nothing can compete when a three minute pop gem goes off in my chest like a cherry bomb, and this year Olivia Rodrigo came armed to the teeth. \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"title": "Nathan Harris — The Sweetness of Water (2021)",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/f14365c41d.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of a series on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/booker21\">novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>\nNB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I came to Nathan Harris’s novel as the last of the thirteen titles longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize, and after it had dropped out of contention (its absence from the shortlist having been announced in September). I was delighted to find a novel at once enormously readable and admirably in tune with human feeling, which depicted a period too little investigated: the days immediately following the post-American Civil War emancipation of enslaved people.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/episode/nathan-harris-the-sweetness-of-water/umc.cmc.5vznmcvigdm0i6ocpzno9hvji?showId=umc.cmc.5h8lbz88c6dbjm6suhviylcui\">interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>, Harris says that part of his ambition with <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> was to tell a new facet of the history of enslavement and emancipation. Specifically, he wished to provide an experience for the reader akin to his own when first reading Edward P Jones’s novel <em>The Known World</em> (2003). Jones’s novel deals, in part, with the matter of Black people who owned slaves; it was something Harris had not previously considered, and a revelation that cast new light on a period of American history too often calcified into the dry repetition of fact.</p>\n<p>Harris sets about his task by interweaving two little-told stories. The first, the lives of formerly-enslaved brothers Landry &amp; Prentiss; the second, a homosexual relationship between two civil war soldiers<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. Enriching these two narratives is a cast of vibrantly drawn characters, and a setting — the fictional town of Old Ox — as distinct and well-realised as any I’ve encountered in a novel for some time. All of which richness Harris employs to great effect in a novel endlessly generous in the gifts of its plot. <em>The Sweetness of Water</em> is replete with captivating action, compellingly told. This begins fairly early, when Harris develops the characters of George &amp; Isabelle, and then switches to their son’s point of view so as to offer the reader new insight. The plot, which builds gradually through an opening section more engaged in establishing the world of Old Ox, only gathers pace throughout – its author keeping a lot of irons in the fire. No sooner is the true nature of Caleb &amp; August’s relationship revealed to the reader, than Landry is murdered. Soon thereafter Prentiss is arrested, and then we switch to Isabelle confronting Clementine about George’s supposed infidelity. These are but some of the beats of the novel’s second act.</p>\n<p>A cynical reader may be inclined to charge the novel with a reliance upon familiar character tropes and incident. Yes, this is a story featuring a corrupt sheriff, a pure-hearted prostitute, and hateful former enslavers. Rivers are forded and shots are fired. There is even an epic wildfire that plays at once like tragedy and allegory<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. It is to Harris’s enormous credit that he uses these ingredients to tell an uncommon story, and one rich with human feeling.

I was delighted to find a novel at once enormously readable and admirably in tune with human feeling, which depicted a period too little investigated: the days immediately following the post-American Civil War emancipation of enslaved people.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIn an [interview with Oprah Winfrey](https://tv.apple.com/gb/episode/nathan-harris-the-sweetness-of-water/umc.cmc.5vznmcvigdm0i6ocpzno9hvji?showId=umc.cmc.5h8lbz88c6dbjm6suhviylcui), Harris says that part of his ambition with *The Sweetness of Water* was to tell a new facet of the history of enslavement and emancipation. Specifically, he wished to provide an experience for the reader akin to his own when first reading Edward P Jones’s novel *The Known World* (2003). Jones’s novel deals, in part, with the matter of Black people who owned slaves; it was something Harris had not previously considered, and a revelation that cast new light on a period of American history too often calcified into the dry repetition of fact. \n\nHarris sets about his task by interweaving two little-told stories. The first, the lives of formerly-enslaved brothers Landry & Prentiss; the second, a homosexual relationship between two civil war soldiers[^1]. Enriching these two narratives is a cast of vibrantly drawn characters, and a setting — the fictional town of Old Ox — as distinct and well-realised as any I’ve encountered in a novel for some time. All of which richness Harris employs to great effect in a novel endlessly generous in the gifts of its plot. *The Sweetness of Water* is replete with captivating action, compellingly told. This begins fairly early, when Harris develops the characters of George & Isabelle, and then switches to their son’s point of view so as to offer the reader new insight. The plot, which builds gradually through an opening section more engaged in establishing the world of Old Ox, only gathers pace throughout – its author keeping a lot of irons in the fire. No sooner is the true nature of Caleb & August’s relationship revealed to the reader, than Landry is murdered. Soon thereafter Prentiss is arrested, and then we switch to Isabelle confronting Clementine about George’s supposed infidelity. These are but some of the beats of the novel’s second act. \n\nA cynical reader may be inclined to charge the novel with a reliance upon familiar character tropes and incident. Yes, this is a story featuring a corrupt sheriff, a pure-hearted prostitute, and hateful former enslavers. Rivers are forded and shots are fired. There is even an epic wildfire that plays at once like tragedy and allegory[^2]. It is to Harris’s enormous credit that he uses these ingredients to tell an uncommon story, and one rich with human feeling. Likewise, in the previously mentioned interview, Harris acknowledges that he may be open to the accusation of having employed the trope of a white saviour. Part of his project, in *The Sweetness of Water* however, is to show the immediate effects of emancipation upon all manner of people: those freed, those who formerly enslaved them, and also those who would seek to help the formerly enslaved begin new lives.

Its spine transcribes the long arc between the making, and the keeping, of the titular promise: that a particular property on the family’s land be given to their maid. It is a novel rich with insight into South African history, and which makes exemplary use of an intriguing cast of central characters to paint a wider picture of injustice, fallibility, and unfulfilled ambition.</p>\n<p>The central story of the novel is captivating enough, but the book’s standout aspect is the manner in which it is narrated. Galgut has chosen to write from a perspective not constrained to multiple first-persons, or even free indirect third-person, but which also stops somewhere short of omniscience. Early in the novel the narrator mistakenly uses the word ‘hearse’ before correcting itself to ‘house’. Not long after comes the first of several direct references to the reader, telling us that one of the novel’s characters ‘dislikes her whole body, as many of you do’. It is narration with personality, as interested in seemingly minor detail as it is in the lives of the central characters. As the novel progresses, it is never less than impressive to see how Galgut affects transitions between perspective with minimal friction. In an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LrcIkgkLLew\">interview with Europa Editions</a>, Galgut says that this form of narrative perspective shifting was partly inspired by work he had been doing on a screenplay. The process, he says, taught him that ‘a narrator could act like a camera’. As adapted to the page, however, it also takes on an aspect of interiority which evades the cinematic lens. We are given a rich depiction of an interior funeral scene, before we skip for a beat into the perspective of the family’s dog. During a city scene, the novel takes a diversion from its central cast to inhabit the unusual vantage of a (possibly mentally ill) homeless man.</p>\n<p>I will admit that my initial impression of this technique was to become overly preoccupied with the <em>identity</em> of the narrator. As I settled into the text, however, I came to recognise that Galgut was employing a variation on narrative techniques familiar from the height of the modernist novel. The blurring and leaking of perspective allows the novel to breach barriers, pushing beyond what its characters know, and also beyond the constraints of the immediate narrative. In the aforementioned interview, Galgut speaks of the way in which he feels that South African literature is freighted with the expectation: ‘no matter how small your story it has to carry the weight of the country’s history’. In this there is an echo of JM Coetzee’s comment that the country’s letters represent a ‘literature in bondage’. We might read Galgut’s shaping of narrative perspective as an attempt to wrestle with that burden, and to free itself — in some respect — from those shackles. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/18/the-promise-by-damon-galgut-review-legacies-of-apartheid\">review for <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Jon Day found that it fell short in some respects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the results are mixed, this might be because the novel sometimes strives too hard to present a balanced collective perspective, or because it fails to reconcile aesthetic with moral questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the most part, I found the manner in which the novel is written to be enormously effective, and I felt this lack of neat reconciliation to represent a deliberate admission of difficulty and complexity.

This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The thirteenth novel by Richard Powers – his first since the Booker-shortlisted, and Pulitzer-winning <em>The Overstory</em> (2018) – is a meditation on climate disaster, personal responsibility, and empathy. It is a novel that plays out at various scales, from a relationship between father and son, to the arena of national policymaking, to the circumstances of imagined life on theoretical planets. Powers is certainly a gifted writer, and he is possessed of both a vast imagination and an impressively thorough command of facts. However, I found that several elements of the novel frustrated me, from the way its characters are drawn, to the tone and manner in which its overall narrative is composed.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>With the caveat that this may all be subjective to my own experience, I’ll begin with the textual, stylistic elements of <em>Bewilderment</em> that irked me. The most common was the myriad ways in which Powers awkwardly introduces facts about the natural world (or the universe more broadly) into the text, through Theo’s narration. In contrast to his relatable concern for his son, and his grieving for his late wife, these interjections repeatedly struck me as off key. Not only did it feel unlikely that anyone genuinely <em>thinks</em> in these hyper-specific bursts of rational fact, it began to feel like the work of the text to convey information rather than story or feeling. It read as though Powers, in his research, had uncovered dozens of things he found so fascinating that he couldn’t stand to leave them out of the text. The result was that I sometimes found Theo’s narration unrealistic and disappointingly flat. Take, as one example, the way in which he relays a simple taxi journey:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I felt us traveling on a small craft, piloting through the capital city of the reigning global superpower on the coast of the third largest continent of a smallish, rocky world near the inner rim of the habitable zone of a G-type dwarf star that lay a quarter of the way out to the edge of a dense, large, barred, spiral galaxy that drifted through a thinly spread local cluster in the dead center of the entire universe. (p210)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It reads like a particularly erudite teenager trying too hard to impress: to overwhelm with fact. In Powers’ case it is more likely an effort to reveal to the reader some of his narrator’s interior, but I found it no more convincing (and no less irritating) each time something like it occurred.</p>\n<p>I had a similar experience with the character of Robin. Particularly in the second act of the novel — as he is changed by his treatment away from a recognisably petulant nine year old, into someone preternaturally empathetic and knowledgeable — he began to function in the text similarly to Leonard Stecyk in David Foster Wallace’s <em>The Pale King</em> (2011): a character whose flawless, self-possessed <em>goodness</em> is matched only by how irritating everyone else finds him. Unlike in Wallace’s novel, however, this is almost certainly not how Powers wants his reader to feel about Robin.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I found the rendering of Aly to be cartoonishly simple. She is written as an unimpeachable font of altruism and empathy, devoid of human flaws. Her absence, which is required by the plot, nevertheless read to me as a device by which to sustain her sainthood. In the world of the novel, and specifically in the eyes of Theo and Robin, nothing short of Aly’s martyrdom will suffice. It is the impossible, impractical standard against which everyone else in the text is found wanting.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>All of which brings me to the broader issues I had with <em>Bewilderment</em>: the ways in which it is confused by its telescoping sense of scale, and – most strikingly – its pervasive sense of pessimism.</p>\n<p>The ambitious manner in which the novel moves back and forth between the scales of the family and the intergalactic is admirable, but it also works to the novel’s detriment in one important regard. By counterpointing Aly’s obsession with practical solutions to present problems, and Theo’s focus on theoretical explorations of unreachably distant worlds, the novel becomes confused about its stakes. What does it matter whether or not Theo can help his son, if Earth will be uninhabitable by the time Robin is a man? And what does Earth’s accelerating climate disaster really matter in the grander scale of the observable universe? These are fascinating questions, which I found <em>Bewilderment</em> willing to ask, but unwilling to venture answers to. I came away frustrated by the manner in which <em>Bewilderment</em> raises problems at all scales, without offering hope that they might be effectively addressed.</p>\n<p>In fact, the novel’s repeated hammering on humanity’s failings, and the consequences thereof, becomes increasingly depressing. <em>Bewilderment</em> is shot through with pessimism not just in the beat-to-beat litany of personal, familial, and bureaucratic shortcomings, but also in the shape of its plot as a whole. There is certainly something captivating and bittersweet in much of Robin’s arc. His rising out of the prison of his own volatile emotions into beatific empathy, only to decline once more when his treatment becomes unavailable, reminded me of Oliver Sacks’s <em>Awakenings</em> (1973)<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. However, Powers chooses to end <em>Bewilderment</em> with Robin’s death. It is presented, alongside the cancellation of the NextGen project and therefore the scuppering of Theo’s life’s work, as a one-two punch that leaves the reader in no doubt as to the message Powers is sending – a pessimism of empathy, politics, and purpose that felt depressing to read.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 review for <em>The Atlantic</em>, Nathaniel Rich noted the dour outlook of Powers’ previous novel, <em>The Overstory</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Humankind is deeply ill, […] The species won’t last long.” This is the consensus among Powers’s characters, and it’s a darkly optimistic one. Optimistic for the planet, pessimistic for the fate of humanity. Once man clears out, nature will return.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same assessment could be made of <em>Bewilderment</em>. Whilst it is to be lauded for its willingness to look directly at the most difficult and colossal of problems, the novel is too analytical, and too trenchantly rational in its perspective, to inspire. It lacks poetry, most notably through its narrative voice, but also more widely in the construction of its narrative.</p>\n<p>In one throwaway moment a fellow ‘planet-hunter’ remarks to Theo that he is lucky to have a son like Robin: “I can’t understand why my boys love <em>Star Wars</em> more than they love the stars.” (p219) One possible answer is that <em>Star Wars</em> —like a lot of fantasy, and like much of the sci-fi Theo professes to enjoy — is a story of hope. Such stories have captivated the human imagination, and served as sources of inspiration, for centuries.

This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.</span> \n\nThe thirteenth novel by Richard Powers – his first since the Booker-shortlisted, and Pulitzer-winning *The Overstory* (2018) – is a meditation on climate disaster, personal responsibility, and empathy. It is a novel that plays out at various scales, from a relationship between father and son, to the arena of national policymaking, to the circumstances of imagined life on theoretical planets. Powers is certainly a gifted writer, and he is possessed of both a vast imagination and an impressively thorough command of facts. However, I found that several elements of the novel frustrated me, from the way its characters are drawn, to the tone and manner in which its overall narrative is composed.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nWith the caveat that this may all be subjective to my own experience, I’ll begin with the textual, stylistic elements of *Bewilderment* that irked me. The most common was the myriad ways in which Powers awkwardly introduces facts about the natural world (or the universe more broadly) into the text, through Theo’s narration. In contrast to his relatable concern for his son, and his grieving for his late wife, these interjections repeatedly struck me as off key. Not only did it feel unlikely that anyone genuinely *thinks* in these hyper-specific bursts of rational fact, it began to feel like the work of the text to convey information rather than story or feeling. It read as though Powers, in his research, had uncovered dozens of things he found so fascinating that he couldn’t stand to leave them out of the text. The result was that I sometimes found Theo’s narration unrealistic and disappointingly flat. Take, as one example, the way in which he relays a simple taxi journey: \n\n> I felt us traveling on a small craft, piloting through the capital city of the reigning global superpower on the coast of the third largest continent of a smallish, rocky world near the inner rim of the habitable zone of a G-type dwarf star that lay a quarter of the way out to the edge of a dense, large, barred, spiral galaxy that drifted through a thinly spread local cluster in the dead center of the entire universe. (p210)\n\nIt reads like a particularly erudite teenager trying too hard to impress: to overwhelm with fact. In Powers’ case it is more likely an effort to reveal to the reader some of his narrator’s interior, but I found it no more convincing (and no less irritating) each time something like it occurred. \n\nI had a similar experience with the character of Robin. Particularly in the second act of the novel — as he is changed by his treatment away from a recognisably petulant nine year old, into someone preternaturally empathetic and knowledgeable — he began to function in the text similarly to Leonard Stecyk in David Foster Wallace’s *The Pale King* (2011): a character whose flawless, self-possessed *goodness* is matched only by how irritating everyone else finds him. Unlike in Wallace’s novel, however, this is almost certainly not how Powers wants his reader to feel about Robin. \n\nSimilarly, I found the rendering of Aly to be cartoonishly simple. She is written as an unimpeachable font of altruism and empathy, devoid of human flaws. Her absence, which is required by the plot, nevertheless read to me as a device by which to sustain her sainthood. In the world of the novel, and specifically in the eyes of Theo and Robin, nothing short of Aly’s martyrdom will suffice. It is the impossible, impractical standard against which everyone else in the text is found wanting.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nAll of which brings me to the broader issues I had with *Bewilderment*: the ways in which it is confused by its telescoping sense of scale, and – most strikingly – its pervasive sense of pessimism. \n\nThe ambitious manner in which the novel moves back and forth between the scales of the family and the intergalactic is admirable, but it also works to the novel’s detriment in one important regard. By counterpointing Aly’s obsession with practical solutions to present problems, and Theo’s focus on theoretical explorations of unreachably distant worlds, the novel becomes confused about its stakes. What does it matter whether or not Theo can help his son, if Earth will be uninhabitable by the time Robin is a man? And what does Earth’s accelerating climate disaster really matter in the grander scale of the observable universe? These are fascinating questions, which I found *Bewilderment* willing to ask, but unwilling to venture answers to. I came away frustrated by the manner in which *Bewilderment* raises problems at all scales, without offering hope that they might be effectively addressed.\n\nIn fact, the novel’s repeated hammering on humanity’s failings, and the consequences thereof, becomes increasingly depressing. *Bewilderment* is shot through with pessimism not just in the beat-to-beat litany of personal, familial, and bureaucratic shortcomings, but also in the shape of its plot as a whole. There is certainly something captivating and bittersweet in much of Robin’s arc. His rising out of the prison of his own volatile emotions into beatific empathy, only to decline once more when his treatment becomes unavailable, reminded me of Oliver Sacks’s *Awakenings* (1973)[^1]. However, Powers chooses to end *Bewilderment* with Robin’s death. It is presented, alongside the cancellation of the NextGen project and therefore the scuppering of Theo’s life’s work, as a one-two punch that leaves the reader in no doubt as to the message Powers is sending – a pessimism of empathy, politics, and purpose that felt depressing to read.  \n\nIn a 2018 review for *The Atlantic*, Nathaniel Rich noted the dour outlook of Powers’ previous novel, *The Overstory*:\n\n> “Humankind is deeply ill, […] The species won’t last long.” This is the consensus among Powers’s characters, and it’s a darkly optimistic one. Optimistic for the planet, pessimistic for the fate of humanity. Once man clears out, nature will return. \n\nThe same assessment could be made of *Bewilderment*. Whilst it is to be lauded for its willingness to look directly at the most difficult and colossal of problems, the novel is too analytical, and too trenchantly rational in its perspective, to inspire. It lacks poetry, most notably through its narrative voice, but also more widely in the construction of its narrative. \n\nIn one throwaway moment a fellow ‘planet-hunter’ remarks to Theo that he is lucky to have a son like Robin: “I can’t understand why my boys love *Star Wars* more than they love the stars.” (p219) One possible answer is that *Star Wars* —like a lot of fantasy, and like much of the sci-fi Theo professes to enjoy — is a story of hope. Such stories have captivated the human imagination, and served as sources of inspiration, for centuries. As well composed as it is, I can’t imagine *Bewilderment* inspiring much besides apathy or despair. \n\n[^1]: Or, more specifically, Penny Marshall’s 1990 film adaptation thereof.\n",

This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Sir Kazuo Ishiguro is the only previous winner on this year’s Booker Prize longlist<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, and I come to his novel — <em>Klara and the Sun</em> — in the week that it was cut from the running, having not made <a href=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/the-final-six-novels\">the shortlist</a>. Nevertheless, it seems likely that this will be one of the most widely read of the current Booker crop, and it is a strong novel. In the final analysis, however, it didn’t shock me to find it missing from the shortlist, as I think it falls short of Ishiguro’s finest work in a couple of key ways.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/27/kazuo-ishiguro-reading-group\">interview with <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Kazuo Ishiguro is quoted as saying “I tend to write the same book over and over, or at least, I take the same subject I took last time out and refine it, or do a slightly different take on it.” The example that he offers for this is (his Booker Prize winning novel) <em>The Remains of the Day</em> (1989), which he refers to as a “remake” of <em>Artist of the Floating World</em> (1986). Ishiguro frames both novels, despite their distinct settings, as works about what it means to waste one’s life: be it professional, personal, or romantic.</p>\n<p>Much of the commentary around <em>Klara and the Sun</em> has figured the novel as a kind of ‘remake’ of 2005’s <em>Never Let Me Go</em> (2005). Both books fall within the broad category of literary science fiction, and both have at their heart shared questions around humanity. In a 2008 interview for <em>The Paris Review</em>, Ishiguro said this of why he chose to use clones as the protagonists in <em>Never Let Me Go</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the attractions about using clones is that it makes people ask immediately, What does it mean to be a human being? It’s a secular route to the Dostoyevskian question, What is a soul? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Undoubtedly, he is asking similar questions with this new novel, and approaching the subject from a slightly different angle. In <em>Klara and the Sun</em> the narration is from the perspective of the titular character, who is an artificial consciousness in a mechanical body<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. Klara’s voice, as narrator, is pleasant and even, though the reader becomes increasingly aware of the ways in which she sees the world differently from those around her. I was reminded, in places, of Mark Haddon’s <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em> (2003), which is narrated by a neurodiverse boy, whose perception of the world shapes the text to a large extent.</p>\n<p>With novels in this mode it becomes the reader’s task to parse some of what is happening <em>through</em> the filter of how the narrator is experiencing it. In Klara’s case, we learn some of the peculiarities of how her vision works; we find that she is fond of specifics (particularly around things like measured dimensions and age); and we slowly grow accustomed to the fact that there are significant gaps in her understanding of the world. This form of narration is something of a double-edged sword in <em>Klara and the Sun</em>. It was certainly interesting to experience the world through a different lens, and to see how Klara perceives the places, people, and circumstances with which she comes into contact. However, increasingly I felt the absence of a dependable baseline of experience against which to make comparison. Unlike Haddon’s novel, for example, which is set in a recognisable turn-of-the-millennium Wiltshire, the reader necessarily <em>cannot</em> come to Ishiguro’s novel with any prior knowledge. This is a world of Artificial Friends and children who are ‘lifted’; the reader’s wish to understand the intricacies of these things is often frustrated by either the narrator’s ignorance of them, her misunderstanding of them, or her lack of interest in them.</p>\n<p>When an author chooses to present a unique world in first-person perspective, there will always be the question of how much explanatory work the narrator is expected to perform. It is a characteristic of many pure fantasy novels, for instance, that a first-person narrator is burdened not only with telling their own story, but also with explaining the nuances of a peculiar world to the reader. The opposite, as employed by Ishiguro here, is to have a narrator unaware (or uninterested) in their role as tour guide, who leaves the reader largely in the dark as to how the world of the novel functions. It becomes part of the work of reading the novel, in these cases, to piece together the concrete particulars of the book’s world. It will likely be a matter of individual readers’ tastes as to how well they feel this is handled in <em>Klara and the Sun</em>. To my mind Ishiguro is operating a couple of steps beyond a level of obscurity that could have provided a richer experience. In the aforementioned <em>Paris Review</em> piece, Ishiguro says this of his writing style:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most writers have certain things that they decide quite consciously, and other things they decide less consciously. In my case, the choice of narrator and setting are deliberate. You do have to choose a setting with great care, because with a setting come all kinds of emotional and historical reverberations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By passing a world necessarily foreign to the reader through the somewhat distorted lens of Klara’s perception, I felt as though Ishiguro had deprived us of the means by which to truly know the world of his novel.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I also felt an uneasy tension in the construction and tone of the narrative. It is as though Ishiguro is not wholly decided as to whether or not the novel is to be read as allegory<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>One particular plot beat, for example, has an almost fairytale-like neatness. A character is conspicuously present who happens to possess the specialist knowledge required to effectively sabotage a particular machine. To compound this, the manner of sabotage happens to require a ‘special liquid’ which would be difficult to obtain were it not for the fact that it is also contained within the workings of Klara’s mechanical body. It is as though Ishiguro is too invested in furthering particular threads of plot, to worry about whether the action feels at all likely within the frame of his story.</p>\n<p>Likewise, there is an irksome disparity between the function that some of the novel’s human characters ultimately wish for Klara to perform, and the reader’s clear understanding that she will not be capable of it. This is an instance in which the reader possesses greater clarity about Klara’s inner life than any of the humans who surround her can. To them, her simulacrum of a human being is often near-perfect; they do not know that her grasp of spatial awareness is so poor that she believes the Sun goes to rest at night in a particular building behind which it sets. When the novel raises questions about the distance between a human girl and an approximation of a human girl, it might frustrate the reader – who alone knows that Klara believes all the pollution in the world to be caused by one machine – that some characters in the novel believe it to be a negligible, bridgeable gap<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded for a <em>body</em> of work, with particular reason given for why the recipient was chosen. In Ishiguro’s case, when he was awarded the 2017 Prize, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2017/press-release/\">the Academy said</a> that he has ‘in novels of great emotional force… uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world’. It is certainly possible to see this latest novel — his first since having been awarded the Nobel Prize — as a continuation of that project. And it is certainly a fascinating, immensely readable entry in that discourse.</p>\n<p>Much of the above may read as though I did not enjoy <em>Klara and the Sun</em>, and that is not at all the case. Ishiguro is a masterful writer, with a deceptively simple prose style, and he is able to sustain the reader’s interest paragraph-to-paragraph and chapter-to-chapter with admirable ease. My complaints largely amount to subjective arguments about stylistic choices, and it is quite possible they may prove to be peculiarities of my own reading. It may well be the case that an approach to the novel that took it primarily as allegorical would find it all the more satisfying.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the book, after an indistinct passage of years has passed, there is a scene in which a roboticist explains to Klara (and thus the reader) that developments in artificial consciousness have outstripped human understanding. In turn, this has led to fear amongst people about the growing capabilities of non-biological minds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They’re afraid because they can’t follow what’s going on inside any more. They can see what you do. They accept that your decisions, your recommendations, are sound and dependable, almost always correct.

				"content_text": "![](/uploads/2023/4f40bdde61.png)\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">Part of a series on <metaa>[novels nominated for the 2021 Booker Prize](/booker21)</metaa>  \nNB. This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.</span> \n\nSir Kazuo Ishiguro is the only previous winner on this year’s Booker Prize longlist[^1], and I come to his novel — *Klara and the Sun* — in the week that it was cut from the running, having not made [the shortlist](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-final-six-novels). Nevertheless, it seems likely that this will be one of the most widely read of the current Booker crop, and it is a strong novel. In the final analysis, however, it didn’t shock me to find it missing from the shortlist, as I think it falls short of Ishiguro’s finest work in a couple of key ways.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIn a 2015 [interview with *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/27/kazuo-ishiguro-reading-group), Kazuo Ishiguro is quoted as saying “I tend to write the same book over and over, or at least, I take the same subject I took last time out and refine it, or do a slightly different take on it.” The example that he offers for this is (his Booker Prize winning novel) *The Remains of the Day* (1989), which he refers to as a “remake” of *Artist of the Floating World* (1986). Ishiguro frames both novels, despite their distinct settings, as works about what it means to waste one’s life: be it professional, personal, or romantic.\n \nMuch of the commentary around *Klara and the Sun* has figured the novel as a kind of ‘remake’ of 2005’s *Never Let Me Go* (2005). Both books fall within the broad category of literary science fiction, and both have at their heart shared questions around humanity. In a 2008 interview for *The Paris Review*, Ishiguro said this of why he chose to use clones as the protagonists in *Never Let Me Go*:\n\n> One of the attractions about using clones is that it makes people ask immediately, What does it mean to be a human being? It’s a secular route to the Dostoyevskian question, What is a soul? \n\nUndoubtedly, he is asking similar questions with this new novel, and approaching the subject from a slightly different angle. In *Klara and the Sun* the narration is from the perspective of the titular character, who is an artificial consciousness in a mechanical body[^2]. Klara’s voice, as narrator, is pleasant and even, though the reader becomes increasingly aware of the ways in which she sees the world differently from those around her. I was reminded, in places, of Mark Haddon’s *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* (2003), which is narrated by a neurodiverse boy, whose perception of the world shapes the text to a large extent. \n\nWith novels in this mode it becomes the reader’s task to parse some of what is happening *through* the filter of how the narrator is experiencing it. In Klara’s case, we learn some of the peculiarities of how her vision works; we find that she is fond of specifics (particularly around things like measured dimensions and age); and we slowly grow accustomed to the fact that there are significant gaps in her understanding of the world. This form of narration is something of a double-edged sword in *Klara and the Sun*. It was certainly interesting to experience the world through a different lens, and to see how Klara perceives the places, people, and circumstances with which she comes into contact. However, increasingly I felt the absence of a dependable baseline of experience against which to make comparison. Unlike Haddon’s novel, for example, which is set in a recognisable turn-of-the-millennium Wiltshire, the reader necessarily *cannot* come to Ishiguro’s novel with any prior knowledge. This is a world of Artificial Friends and children who are ‘lifted’; the reader’s wish to understand the intricacies of these things is often frustrated by either the narrator’s ignorance of them, her misunderstanding of them, or her lack of interest in them. \n\nWhen an author chooses to present a unique world in first-person perspective, there will always be the question of how much explanatory work the narrator is expected to perform. It is a characteristic of many pure fantasy novels, for instance, that a first-person narrator is burdened not only with telling their own story, but also with explaining the nuances of a peculiar world to the reader. The opposite, as employed by Ishiguro here, is to have a narrator unaware (or uninterested) in their role as tour guide, who leaves the reader largely in the dark as to how the world of the novel functions. It becomes part of the work of reading the novel, in these cases, to piece together the concrete particulars of the book’s world. It will likely be a matter of individual readers’ tastes as to how well they feel this is handled in *Klara and the Sun*. To my mind Ishiguro is operating a couple of steps beyond a level of obscurity that could have provided a richer experience. In the aforementioned *Paris Review* piece, Ishiguro says this of his writing style:\n\n> Most writers have certain things that they decide quite consciously, and other things they decide less consciously. In my case, the choice of narrator and setting are deliberate. You do have to choose a setting with great care, because with a setting come all kinds of emotional and historical reverberations.\n\nBy passing a world necessarily foreign to the reader through the somewhat distorted lens of Klara’s perception, I felt as though Ishiguro had deprived us of the means by which to truly know the world of his novel.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nI also felt an uneasy tension in the construction and tone of the narrative. It is as though Ishiguro is not wholly decided as to whether or not the novel is to be read as allegory[^3]. \n\nOne particular plot beat, for example, has an almost fairytale-like neatness. A character is conspicuously present who happens to possess the specialist knowledge required to effectively sabotage a particular machine. To compound this, the manner of sabotage happens to require a ‘special liquid’ which would be difficult to obtain were it not for the fact that it is also contained within the workings of Klara’s mechanical body. It is as though Ishiguro is too invested in furthering particular threads of plot, to worry about whether the action feels at all likely within the frame of his story. \n\nLikewise, there is an irksome disparity between the function that some of the novel’s human characters ultimately wish for Klara to perform, and the reader’s clear understanding that she will not be capable of it. This is an instance in which the reader possesses greater clarity about Klara’s inner life than any of the humans who surround her can. To them, her simulacrum of a human being is often near-perfect; they do not know that her grasp of spatial awareness is so poor that she believes the Sun goes to rest at night in a particular building behind which it sets. When the novel raises questions about the distance between a human girl and an approximation of a human girl, it might frustrate the reader – who alone knows that Klara believes all the pollution in the world to be caused by one machine – that some characters in the novel believe it to be a negligible, bridgeable gap[^4].  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded for a *body* of work, with particular reason given for why the recipient was chosen. In Ishiguro’s case, when he was awarded the 2017 Prize, [the Academy said](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2017/press-release/) that he has ‘in novels of great emotional force… uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world’. It is certainly possible to see this latest novel — his first since having been awarded the Nobel Prize — as a continuation of that project. And it is certainly a fascinating, immensely readable entry in that discourse. \n\nMuch of the above may read as though I did not enjoy *Klara and the Sun*, and that is not at all the case. Ishiguro is a masterful writer, with a deceptively simple prose style, and he is able to sustain the reader’s interest paragraph-to-paragraph and chapter-to-chapter with admirable ease. My complaints largely amount to subjective arguments about stylistic choices, and it is quite possible they may prove to be peculiarities of my own reading. It may well be the case that an approach to the novel that took it primarily as allegorical would find it all the more satisfying. \n\nTowards the end of the book, after an indistinct passage of years has passed, there is a scene in which a roboticist explains to Klara (and thus the reader) that developments in artificial consciousness have outstripped human understanding. In turn, this has led to fear amongst people about the growing capabilities of non-biological minds.\n\n> They’re afraid because they can’t follow what’s going on inside any more. They can see what you do. They accept that your decisions, your recommendations, are sound and dependable, almost always correct. But they don’t like not knowing how you arrive at them.\n\nIronically, I found *Klara and the Sun* to be a very enjoyable and tenderly composed novel, which was somewhat at odds with its depiction of the functioning of its narrator’s artificial consciousness.\n\n[^1]:\tAlongside Rachel Cusk and Richard Powers, he is one of three previous nominees.\n\n[^2]: A great deal of caution is required when discussing books in this genre space, to avoid using terms that may have specific connotations within the world of the novel. We might think of Klara, broadly, as an Artificial Intelligence, or say that she is an android, but these are not terms that the novel employs, and their absence is evidently a choice on the author’s part.\n\n[^3]: Likewise, there are certainly threads of the text that could be read as religious commentary; the intent, however, is not made explicit.\n\n[^4]: Consider, by way of comparison, Steven Spielberg’s 2001 film *A.I. Artificial Intelligence*, which raises this same question, but profits from the viewer’s comparatively less-direct access to the workings of an artificial consciousness.\n",

That isn’t intended in an entirely pejorative sense, since Karen Jennings is certainly aiming – with some elements of <em>An Island</em> – to make the reader uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>The narrative moves back and forth between an undated present and past in the life of its protagonist: Samuel. In doing so, the novel gives a wider picture of the misery and loss he has endured before ending up alone on a desolate island where he serves as lighthouse keeper. When the introduction of an unnamed man breaks decades of Samuel’s solitude, the reader comes to realise that his presence represents not just a dramatic change in Samuel’s life, but an opportunity to atone for some mistakes of his past.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>John Donne’s ‘Meditation XVII’, to which the title of Karen Jennings’s novel can’t help but allude, is an expression of common humanity, in which Donne expresses the human condition in terms of shared suffering:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; any man&rsquo;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is certainly open to the charge of being morbid, but it is ultimately a hopeful work that revels in the universality of the human experience, including that of mortal death:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, I found <em>An Island</em> to be an unrelentingly pessimistic work, such that it leaves the reader feeling that it has nothing much to say. The most significant difference, I found, was a complete absence of faith in Jennings’s novel.</p>\n<p>The locus of faith in Donne’s work is in the Christian God — Donne was, after all, an Anglican priest at the time of composing <em>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</em> (1623) — but <em>An Island</em> also calls to mind the works of staunch atheist Samuel Beckett. In plays such as <em>Waiting for Godot</em> (1952) and <em>Endgame</em> (1957), Beckett has pairs of characters marooned in unforgiving environs, with little hope for the future. In these works — though the characters may be loathe to admit it — faith is found in the human spirit’s endurance, and the stubborn will to survive. Despite stark settings and pitch dark subjects, these are plays of humour that find warmth in the natures of their characters, and in their interactions. <em>An Island</em>, by contrast, seemed to me entirely cynical. It lacks any sense whatsoever of a universal order, but it also refuses to replace it with any sense of faith in its characters’ humanity, or in humanity generally.</p>\n<p>The scope of the narrative, for instance, encompasses several eras of governance for its unnamed country. A revolution for independence replaces a colonial power with a President; the President is later overthrown in favour of a Dictator, and so on. Throughout, there are physical changes to some parts of the unnamed city, but the lives of the people barely change, and the slums do not improve, they only grow in size. Likewise, the novel has no faith in the power of people, or political activism, to engender meaningful change. Any sense of hope that a character experiences is quickly undercut by another, promising that it is futile:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The woman smiled, but the man said, “It was like this for us too, uncle. I’m sorry to tell you that. We were exactly like you.”<br>\nSamuel’s father laughed. “No, my friend, that isn’t possible. This is a free and democratic country. We’re independent, we have it all now. There will be no problems here. Your country did it the wrong way, you made mistakes.”<br>\n“Wait, uncle. You will see.” (p74)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, when Samuel is moved to directly participate in frustrating for change, he too is quickly disillusioned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The march could not be stopped. Not this tide of men and women who would no longer be told how to live. They had given up fear. They knew only strength.<br>\nOnly afterwards, in the first interrogation room, did he learn that the march had been poorly attended, with little more than two thousand people participating. The event had barely disrupted the peace, and though hundreds had died and many more were arrested, it had made no impact at all. (p94)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as the works of groups are depicted as ineffectual, so the novel also has no faith in the ability of individuals to meaningfully change. Towards the end of the book, Jennings has reduced her elderly protagonist to little more than paranoia and base impulse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He thought only of that word he had spoken down in the stone hut: violence – though now he uttered another world altogether, “Mine.” He stood up from where he had been kneeling. And again, “Mine” as he grabbed the knife out of the man’s hand. “Mine, mine, mine!” (p98)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The act of violence on which the novel ends is but the latest in a depressing, predictable sequence. It serves as but one more example in the novel of violence rendered in response to violence, and accomplishing nothing.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One might expect that in a novel so pessimistic about humanity, notes of optimism might be found in the depiction of nature. Instead, the natural world is often shown in <em>An Island</em> not as a force for rejuvenation, but as an adversary to be guarded against. Often, unsurprisingly in the world of the novel, this requires some form of violence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>he manipulated the weed with lit matches, watching it twist and shrivel, not stopping until he was certain enough damage had been done that it would never grow again. (p15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At best, nature is sometimes shown to hold the power of erasure; for the most part, like the man-made change of the novel, much of what the natural world offers is bad and getting worse. A late scene depicts what at first seems to be a miraculous natural event: the annual arrival of giant crabs to the island. Quickly, however, the beauty of the event is undermined. The crabs (just like the island’s hens) attack one another, before the humans also attack the crabs. Next the reader is told of how precipitously the crab populations have declined, and how the small crabs that remain taste comparatively awful. If the sequence fails to depress, it is only because by this point in the novel the reader has likely been numbed into expecting nothing else.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Much of the above may have been more palatable to me, had I felt that the novel had something to say about a specific time, place, or culture. Instead, I felt that Jennings’s choice to make her novel purely an allegory robbed it of any chance of making meaningful political statements. Take, for example, this exchange, which is typical of the book’s political discourse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“But you don’t agree with the idea of fighting against tyranny? You support the Dictator?” asked Big Ro.<br>\n“No, I’m not saying that. I know about opposing power. My father was amongst those who fought for independence.” (pp78-79)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whom among us <em>would</em> support ‘the Dictator’? What does it mean to ‘oppose power’, or ‘fight for independence’? The novel is so determined to remain entirely allegorical that it absolutely refuses to be specific about any of these matters. Samuel’s political awakening is also rendered in similarly cursory terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They went to regular meetings, passed worn paperbacks between them in which they read theories of how to create a better world and life. They recited quotes from the texts, argued over words and phrases. At the meetings they rose, made speeches. (p91)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.litnet.co.za/an-island-by-joanne-hichens-an-interview/\">interview for LitNet</a>, Jennings explicitly frames her responsibility as a novelist so as to exclude the need to answer any of the questions she poses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My job as a writer is to hold a mirror up to these realities, but it is not within my abilities to suggest solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem is that, so foggy and blurred is the mirror, that nothing can be seen of the ‘realities’ but the vaguest of outlines. Does the reader agree, in principle, that it is right to ‘oppose tyranny’? Regardless of the answer, the novel suggests, nothing will really change.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In another <a href=\"https://johannesburgreviewofbooks.com/2021/08/19/i-decided-to-give-up-writing-and-to-rethink-my-life-karen-jennings-chats-to-jennifer-malec-about-her-booker-prize-longlisted-novel-an-island/\">interview, this one with the <em>Johannesburg Review of Books</em></a>, Jennings discusses the difficulties she faced in writing <em>An Island</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was so much that was difficult about it. Firstly, trying to write a sensitive and nuanced book about a very complex set of topics—to do it without being heavy handed or reductive. Secondly, to write a readable, compelling story in which basically nothing happens!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To the first point, I found <em>An Island</em> to be too steeped in the vagaries of allegory to have anything insightful to say about either the political realities of post-colonialism, or the manner in which living in such circumstances might shape a person. And, as to the second point, I’m not convinced Jennings has succeeded there either. Paragraph-to-paragraph I enjoyed her writing well enough, but the relative slightness of the story, paired with its unrelenting cynicism, made the book feel increasingly like a chore as it progressed.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the context in which I read <em>An Island</em> — as part of a Booker Prize longlist marathon — also makes for comparisons from which it does not profit. There is Anuk Arudpragasam’s <em>A Passage North</em>, which is more thoughtful and more grounded in its depiction of a country shaped by a history of conflict. And there is even a short section of Maggie Shipstead’s <em>Great Circle</em> that takes place on a secluded island, and which contains more deft character work than the entirety of Jennings’s novel.</p>\n",

Regardless of the answer, the novel suggests, nothing will really change.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIn another [interview, this one with the *Johannesburg Review of Books*](https://johannesburgreviewofbooks.com/2021/08/19/i-decided-to-give-up-writing-and-to-rethink-my-life-karen-jennings-chats-to-jennifer-malec-about-her-booker-prize-longlisted-novel-an-island/), Jennings discusses the difficulties she faced in writing *An Island*: \n\n> There was so much that was difficult about it. Firstly, trying to write a sensitive and nuanced book about a very complex set of topics—to do it without being heavy handed or reductive. Secondly, to write a readable, compelling story in which basically nothing happens!\n\nTo the first point, I found *An Island* to be too steeped in the vagaries of allegory to have anything insightful to say about either the political realities of post-colonialism, or the manner in which living in such circumstances might shape a person. And, as to the second point, I’m not convinced Jennings has succeeded there either. Paragraph-to-paragraph I enjoyed her writing well enough, but the relative slightness of the story, paired with its unrelenting cynicism, made the book feel increasingly like a chore as it progressed. \n\nUnfortunately, the context in which I read *An Island* — as part of a Booker Prize longlist marathon — also makes for comparisons from which it does not profit. There is Anuk Arudpragasam’s *A Passage North*, which is more thoughtful and more grounded in its depiction of a country shaped by a history of conflict. And there is even a short section of Maggie Shipstead’s *Great Circle* that takes place on a secluded island, and which contains more deft character work than the entirety of Jennings’s novel. \n",

This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>One of the joys of choosing to read the entirety of the 2021 Booker Prize longlist, is being able to start novels knowing very little about them. I began Anuk Arudpragasam’s <em>A Passage North</em> without so much as having read the back cover, and I was delighted to find a novel full of heart and human feeling, unafraid to address the largest of topics with an assured, light touch.</p>\n<p>I was most impressed by the structure of Arudpragasam’s novel, which has at its centre a relatively simple narrative: someone associated with the protagonist’s family dies, and he travels to attend their funeral. From here, however, the author uses the spine of the story to make a series of discursive forays into larger questions in Krishan’s life, and on his mind. The manner in which the text moves smoothly into and out of these extended meditations is handled with the utmost care. The reader finds themselves caught up in Krishan’s thoughts on a particular poem, or his hopes and fears surrounding his relationship with a partner, and is then returned to the slow-moving flow of the main narrative with something more about Krishan’s character having been illuminated. These discursions — which hold a prominence in the text above that of the contemporary action, such that in truth they are the substance of the novel — are sometimes intensely personal, and sometimes more widely scoped.

This post discusses the entire novel; proceed at risk of spoilers.</span> \n\nOne of the joys of choosing to read the entirety of the 2021 Booker Prize longlist, is being able to start novels knowing very little about them. I began Anuk Arudpragasam’s *A Passage North* without so much as having read the back cover, and I was delighted to find a novel full of heart and human feeling, unafraid to address the largest of topics with an assured, light touch. \n\nI was most impressed by the structure of Arudpragasam’s novel, which has at its centre a relatively simple narrative: someone associated with the protagonist’s family dies, and he travels to attend their funeral. From here, however, the author uses the spine of the story to make a series of discursive forays into larger questions in Krishan’s life, and on his mind. The manner in which the text moves smoothly into and out of these extended meditations is handled with the utmost care. The reader finds themselves caught up in Krishan’s thoughts on a particular poem, or his hopes and fears surrounding his relationship with a partner, and is then returned to the slow-moving flow of the main narrative with something more about Krishan’s character having been illuminated. These discursions — which hold a prominence in the text above that of the contemporary action, such that in truth they are the substance of the novel — are sometimes intensely personal, and sometimes more widely scoped. As such, it will help the reader to have at least a broad understanding of the contours of the Sri Lankan civil war, but tellingly the more universally accessible themes are the more specific, interpersonal ones. I found particularly affecting the saga, relayed early in the novel, of Krishan’s grandmother’s declining health, and thus declining independence. Arudpragasam makes of it a delicate, compassionate examination of pride and human frailty.[^1]  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nFor the majority of the text, an overall arc to the novel remained hidden to me.

Arudpragasam has carefully introduced these ideas throughout the novel — as part, for example, of Krishan’s retelling of the story of the Buddha — but only towards the text’s conclusion does his protagonist begin to exhibit a deeper-seated, personal understanding of them. \n\nThis nascent insight, of course, cannot extinguish the baseline suffering of the human condition — what, in Tamil, would be called துக்கம் (*thukkam*), and which western Buddhists are more likely to know by its Pali name: *dukkha*. Towards the very end of the text we find Krishan attempting to establish for himself a frame for this dilemma that places ‘desire’ in contrast to ‘yearning’: \n\n> To desire, in a sense, was to know or think one knew what one wanted, to know or think one knew the paths by which it might be reached, even if those paths turned out to be too difficult to follow, even if the things they led to, the things one desired, turned out not to provide the liberation one thought.

I can only say that I found <em>Great Circle</em> to be an unalloyed pleasure. The experience of reading it was reminiscent of first encounters with similarly ambitious novels, such as Michael Chabon’s <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</em> (2000), and Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> (2013). Having deliberately begun the novel with no prior knowledge, I was at first surprised and delighted, and then found myself walking the emotional tightrope of being so impressed and swept along by a novel that I was desperate for it to not falter!

It’s as though, having begun the novel with a sinking ocean liner, then moving to mountaintop horse-riding, and biplane flying barnstormers, Shipstead thinks <em>why not</em>, and proceeds to include Prohibition era gangsters, bordellos, assassination, wartime romance, and finally – of course – a flight around the world. At each turn I found myself marvelling at both the novel’s scope and its ambition. In lesser hands it is a recipe for either a jumbled mess or at best some camp, pulpy fun.

Shipstead unfailingly knows when best to pause the story’s self-perpetuated momentum, and indulge in the scenes that she has brought about. Take, as just one example, this passage from the beginning of the novel that feels as though the author is pulling the camera out, better to frame the action:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Below [the ship’s] lights and honeycombed cabins, below the men toiling in red heat and black dust, below her barnacled keel, a school of cod passed, a dense pack of flexing bodies in the darkness, eyes bulging wide though there was nothing to see. Below the fish: cold and pressure, empty black miles, a few strange, luminescent creatures drifting after flecks of food. Then the sandy bottom, blank except for faint trails left by hardy shrimp, blind worms, creatures who would never know such a thing as light existed. (p20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On countless occasions, Shipstead proves herself to be enormously skilled at conjuring striking images that leaps off the page for the reader:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once a riderless horse had run into the hangar at their aerodrome from God knows where, dreadfully burned, perhaps mistaking the structure for a barn. They’d shot the poor thing to put it out of its misery. “One time,” Felix said, “I was shooting at a German and his engine caught fire, so he climbed out onto the wing and jumped. He was wearing a huge brown fur coat and looked like a bear falling through the sky. (p89)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, whilst I frequently found myself re-reading such moments to enjoy the frame that Shipstead had frozen, the true pleasure of the novel comes from immersing oneself in the grand, romantic architecture of its narrative. <em>Great Circle</em> has at its core some big questions: such as that of the individual’s power to pursue their ambitions, and the extent to which ambition itself is a dangerous compass by which to navigate. I found these threads intertwined with the similarly large and thorny question of destiny in the novel, in a manner that grew pleasantly more nuanced and complicated throughout.</p>\n<p>Early in the book allusions are made suggesting a natural order by which things progress: Marian’s uncle Wallace explaining to her that ‘Water was always on its way somewhere bigger’ (p45). And, indeed, it feels like love-at-first-sight to Marian when she initially encounters flight first hand. But, as the novel progresses, there is a more troubling instance of love-at-first-sight figured in Barclay’s controlling obsession with Marian.</p>\n<p>These loves each prove to be fraught in different ways. As Barclay comes to find that ‘what he wants is not actually in her but beyond her’ (p204), so Marian ‘longs to fly on even though the horizon will only ever recede’ (p195). The central tenet of their relationship proves to be that Marian often gets what she wants, but wonders constantly at the price; she ‘senses she is inside a trap, the dimensions and mechanism of which remain concealed’ (p187).</p>\n<p>The relationship remains compelling precisely because Shipstead resists the temptation to make Barclay out as a cartoon villain, and is content to complicate the dynamics, and leave the complications unresolved. When the trade of sex in return for flying ‘over the line’ happens, it is not clear to the reader whose idea it ultimately is, Marian’s or Barclay’s.</p>\n<p>When, later in the text, Hadley critiques Carol Redwood’s book for trying to make Marian into too much of a romantic character, it helped emphasise for me the extent to which, throughout <em>Great Circle</em>, Shipstead walks this line assuredly. She is always more interested in making Marian a fuller, more nuanced presence no matter how grand and romantic the arc of her life might appear from the macro perspective.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If I had one quibble with the novel, it is that as the narratives progresses it develops a slight problem with stakes. Switching between Marian’s life-and-death exploits during the Second World War, to Hadley’s love triangle, sometimes made the latter seem ridiculous. I found myself increasingly frustrated with Hadley’s sometimes myopic narration in these passages, precisely because her problems were comparatively slight.</p>\n<p>There is every chance, however, that this has something to do with me as a reader. There is one stretch, about two thirds of the way through the novel, where multiple chapters in a row deal first with Hadley’s complicated relationship with Alexei, then Marian’s complicated relationship with Caleb, and then Jamie’s complicated relationship with Sarah. Shipstead may have constructed things this way so as to invite the reader to draw comparisons, but the beats of these relationships were never as interesting to me as the larger themes of the novel. As such, the portions of the book that centred relationship intrigue for extended periods felt to me like distractions from the real narrative, to which I longed to return.</p>\n<p>It was around this same point in the novel that I began to hope that there would prove to be more to Hadley’s story than simply a clever device, teasing the reader as to what happened to Marian. Ultimately I was pleased that Shipstead refrained from making explicit comparisons between the two women. She simply provides the raw material, and allows the reader to draw from it what they wish. I, for example, enjoyed the parallel between Marian’s experience in the endless white  of the Antarctic, and Hadley’s in the darkness of the glow worm cave: both women unsure whether they are still alive, or if they’ve unknowingly passed through the veil into death. In the final analysis Hadley’s story proves to be far more than a mere plot device, but the novel is very much Marian’s. I can imagine that knowing this, and thus being free from second-guessing the author’s intentions as to structure, will only strengthen this already extraordinary book for me on a second reading.</p>\n",

I found these threads intertwined with the similarly large and thorny question of destiny in the novel, in a manner that grew pleasantly more nuanced and complicated throughout. \n\nEarly in the book allusions are made suggesting a natural order by which things progress: Marian’s uncle Wallace explaining to her that ‘Water was always on its way somewhere bigger’ (p45). And, indeed, it feels like love-at-first-sight to Marian when she initially encounters flight first hand. But, as the novel progresses, there is a more troubling instance of love-at-first-sight figured in Barclay’s controlling obsession with Marian. \n\nThese loves each prove to be fraught in different ways. As Barclay comes to find that ‘what he wants is not actually in her but beyond her’ (p204), so Marian ‘longs to fly on even though the horizon will only ever recede’ (p195). The central tenet of their relationship proves to be that Marian often gets what she wants, but wonders constantly at the price; she ‘senses she is inside a trap, the dimensions and mechanism of which remain concealed’ (p187). \n\nThe relationship remains compelling precisely because Shipstead resists the temptation to make Barclay out as a cartoon villain, and is content to complicate the dynamics, and leave the complications unresolved. When the trade of sex in return for flying ‘over the line’ happens, it is not clear to the reader whose idea it ultimately is, Marian’s or Barclay’s. \n\nWhen, later in the text, Hadley critiques Carol Redwood’s book for trying to make Marian into too much of a romantic character, it helped emphasise for me the extent to which, throughout *Great Circle*, Shipstead walks this line assuredly. She is always more interested in making Marian a fuller, more nuanced presence no matter how grand and romantic the arc of her life might appear from the macro perspective.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIf I had one quibble with the novel, it is that as the narratives progresses it develops a slight problem with stakes. Switching between Marian’s life-and-death exploits during the Second World War, to Hadley’s love triangle, sometimes made the latter seem ridiculous. I found myself increasingly frustrated with Hadley’s sometimes myopic narration in these passages, precisely because her problems were comparatively slight.  \n\nThere is every chance, however, that this has something to do with me as a reader. There is one stretch, about two thirds of the way through the novel, where multiple chapters in a row deal first with Hadley’s complicated relationship with Alexei, then Marian’s complicated relationship with Caleb, and then Jamie’s complicated relationship with Sarah. Shipstead may have constructed things this way so as to invite the reader to draw comparisons, but the beats of these relationships were never as interesting to me as the larger themes of the novel. As such, the portions of the book that centred relationship intrigue for extended periods felt to me like distractions from the real narrative, to which I longed to return. \n\nIt was around this same point in the novel that I began to hope that there would prove to be more to Hadley’s story than simply a clever device, teasing the reader as to what happened to Marian. Ultimately I was pleased that Shipstead refrained from making explicit comparisons between the two women. She simply provides the raw material, and allows the reader to draw from it what they wish. I, for example, enjoyed the parallel between Marian’s experience in the endless white  of the Antarctic, and Hadley’s in the darkness of the glow worm cave: both women unsure whether they are still alive, or if they’ve unknowingly passed through the veil into death. In the final analysis Hadley’s story proves to be far more than a mere plot device, but the novel is very much Marian’s. I can imagine that knowing this, and thus being free from second-guessing the author’s intentions as to structure, will only strengthen this already extraordinary book for me on a second reading. \n",

				"title": "On c. 20 Years of Writing on the Web",
				"content_html": "<p>Recently, apropos of nothing in particular, I did some thinking about how and why I got started blogging. That led to a mild shock of realisation that it had been two decades since I first created a Blogger account. In turn, that seemed like reason enough for a little reflection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-it-started\">How It Started</h3>\n<p>Along one of the shorter sides of the University of Reading&rsquo;s main campus green space sits a building constructed mostly from dark brown brick, with a white entrance façade. This weirdly angular structure is the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/vJhbmebJTtfWgDEn8\">Palmer Building</a>, and it was home to a couple of milestone moments for me during my time at the University. It was in the 400 seat Palmer Lecture Theatre that I sat watching a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236216/\">documentary about the Sex Pistols</a>, whilst the rest of my Law school cohort attended a gala function. It was in the same lecture hall that I saw my first iPod in the wild, looking eagerly (perhaps even a little creepily) over another student&rsquo;s shoulder as he scrolled and scrolled that mechanical wheel, changing selections on the monochrome screen. I myself, at the time, was notoriously never more than arm&rsquo;s reach from my CD Walkman – one professor started calling me &lsquo;wired for sound&rsquo; for my habit of wearing headphones around my neck during her seminars.</p>\n<p>However, it isn&rsquo;t the lecture theatre of the Palmer Building that I remember most clearly, but the room directly beneath it. On a couple of rows of tables were set out a dozen or so chunky Pentium II PCs: dull metal towers the size of a (large) briefcase, and CRT monitors as deep as they were wide. At a time when only <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/275999/household-internet-penetration-in-great-britain/\">13% of UK homes</a> were connected to the internet, there was something magical to me about a roomful of machines wired up to the web. And the real joy of that room was that, unlike the rest of the building, it could be accessed 24 hours a day. I was already enamoured of the internet by the time I reached University in 1999, but that was where the relationship really developed. With a magnetic keycard and an entry code I could access the web any time I wanted. And so I did. Foregoing study, socialising, and sleep, I frequently left my room in Wells Hall in the late evening and — with <em>Neon Ballroom</em> or <em>Hybrid Theory</em> on my headphones — made the 10 minute walk to the Palmer Building Computer Room. Often the number pad on which you were expected to enter an access code refused to cooperate, and you had to rely on there being someone else inside who had also chosen to spend their night with the internet, and who would answer your pleading knock.</p>\n<p>It was in that room that I asked and was asked for my &lsquo;<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a/s/l\">a/s/l</a>&rsquo; on the brand new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger\">MSN Messenger</a>. It was there that I ignored all dictums against installing software, and instead lobbied my fellow late night denizens to join me in multiplayer LAN sessions of <em>Doom II</em>. When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups\">Yahoo! Groups</a> launched during my second year, I spent uncountable late night hours in that room arguing the merits of various punk bands with Americans in the middle of their days, and Europeans even deeper into their nights.</p>\n<p>It was to that room that I went on September 11th 2001, having received an SMS on my Nokia 3210 from an ex-girlfriend telling me to turn on the TV. My TV wasn&rsquo;t hooked up, but I knew a place I could get all the information I needed, and where I&rsquo;d be able to join countless other people asking one another just what the heck was going on.</p>\n<p>And it was also in that room that I began writing my first blog. Hosted  on Pyra Labs' Blogger (pre Google acquisition), mine was the simplest stream of posts on the music I was listening to, films I was watching, books I was reading, and games I was playing.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to hear why Deftones' <em>White Pony</em> was an instant classic; observe in real-time as <em>Mulholland Drive</em> melted my mind; read an argument about what made <em>Invisible Monsters</em> a worthy follow-up to <em>Fight Club</em>; or lament the premature death of the Dreamcast, I had you covered. In the years since, I&rsquo;ve had blogs and personal sites hosted on various platforms (Wordpress, Squarespace, Svbtle), and in truth the subject matter has remained largely unchanged!

				"content_text": "Recently, apropos of nothing in particular, I did some thinking about how and why I got started blogging. That led to a mild shock of realisation that it had been two decades since I first created a Blogger account. In turn, that seemed like reason enough for a little reflection.\n\n### How It Started\n\nAlong one of the shorter sides of the University of Reading's main campus green space sits a building constructed mostly from dark brown brick, with a white entrance façade. This weirdly angular structure is the [Palmer Building](https://goo.gl/maps/vJhbmebJTtfWgDEn8), and it was home to a couple of milestone moments for me during my time at the University. It was in the 400 seat Palmer Lecture Theatre that I sat watching a [documentary about the Sex Pistols](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236216/), whilst the rest of my Law school cohort attended a gala function. It was in the same lecture hall that I saw my first iPod in the wild, looking eagerly (perhaps even a little creepily) over another student's shoulder as he scrolled and scrolled that mechanical wheel, changing selections on the monochrome screen. I myself, at the time, was notoriously never more than arm's reach from my CD Walkman – one professor started calling me 'wired for sound' for my habit of wearing headphones around my neck during her seminars.\n\nHowever, it isn't the lecture theatre of the Palmer Building that I remember most clearly, but the room directly beneath it. On a couple of rows of tables were set out a dozen or so chunky Pentium II PCs: dull metal towers the size of a (large) briefcase, and CRT monitors as deep as they were wide. At a time when only [13% of UK homes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/275999/household-internet-penetration-in-great-britain/) were connected to the internet, there was something magical to me about a roomful of machines wired up to the web. And the real joy of that room was that, unlike the rest of the building, it could be accessed 24 hours a day. I was already enamoured of the internet by the time I reached University in 1999, but that was where the relationship really developed. With a magnetic keycard and an entry code I could access the web any time I wanted. And so I did. Foregoing study, socialising, and sleep, I frequently left my room in Wells Hall in the late evening and — with *Neon Ballroom* or *Hybrid Theory* on my headphones — made the 10 minute walk to the Palmer Building Computer Room. Often the number pad on which you were expected to enter an access code refused to cooperate, and you had to rely on there being someone else inside who had also chosen to spend their night with the internet, and who would answer your pleading knock. \n\nIt was in that room that I asked and was asked for my '[a/s/l](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a/s/l)' on the brand new [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger). It was there that I ignored all dictums against installing software, and instead lobbied my fellow late night denizens to join me in multiplayer LAN sessions of *Doom II*. When [Yahoo! Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups) launched during my second year, I spent uncountable late night hours in that room arguing the merits of various punk bands with Americans in the middle of their days, and Europeans even deeper into their nights. \n\nIt was to that room that I went on September 11th 2001, having received an SMS on my Nokia 3210 from an ex-girlfriend telling me to turn on the TV. My TV wasn't hooked up, but I knew a place I could get all the information I needed, and where I'd be able to join countless other people asking one another just what the heck was going on.\n\nAnd it was also in that room that I began writing my first blog. Hosted  on Pyra Labs' Blogger (pre Google acquisition), mine was the simplest stream of posts on the music I was listening to, films I was watching, books I was reading, and games I was playing. \n\nIf you wanted to hear why Deftones' *White Pony* was an instant classic; observe in real-time as *Mulholland Drive* melted my mind; read an argument about what made *Invisible Monsters* a worthy follow-up to *Fight Club*; or lament the premature death of the Dreamcast, I had you covered. In the years since, I've had blogs and personal sites hosted on various platforms (Wordpress, Squarespace, Svbtle), and in truth the subject matter has remained largely unchanged! Occasionally I've run social accounts alongside these sites, but the blog was always there as a home for my ~~more considered~~ lengthier thoughts.\n\n### How It's Going\n\nIn the year 2021 I find myself several years deep into a state of confusion about what the social web has become.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-joywave--possession\">20. Joywave — <em>Possession</em></h3>\n<p>Three years ago Joywave announced themselves to me, and took second place on my 2017 list, with their sophomore album <em>Content</em>. At the time I said that I found the band ‘very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent’ and guess what? <em>Possession</em> is another assured, multi-faceted set of a dozen uncategorisable bops. Of the previous record I listed the genres touched upon as ‘including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…’ and that’s still all in the mix here though, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on the new album feels slightly more humane and less coldly electronic than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Like a Kennedy’ is, for me, one of the defining songs of the Trump / Brexit era: a vulnerable, exhausted lament that asks only for the simplest things amidst incomprehensible turmoil. ‘F.E.A.R.’ twists ‘Monster Mash’ DNA into a campy downbeat stomp, whereas ‘Funny Thing About Opinions’ is an upbeat treatise on the state of internet dialogue.</p>\n<p>This is another record of surprising, inventive dance-pop-rock cuts that was everything I wanted from more Joywave. I would love to see these guys live when that’s possible once more, though—with the same sense of humour apparent in their music—the band’s faux-Fox News website informs me that their touring has been postponed ‘due to pressure from health experts and communists’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-oliver-coates--skins-n-slime\">19. Oliver Coates — <em>skins n slime</em></h3>\n<p>On my spider-diagram of musical influences there would be a large number of lines spreading outwards from Radiohead, and Oliver Coates is the newest addition. It seems like a fitting way to encounter a classically trained cellist making something he’s called (probably with tongue firmly in cheek) ‘pastoral metal’.</p>\n<p>It’s a tough task to affix meaningful labels to what Coates is doing on <em>skins n slime</em>, and that’s not a bad thing. Sure, I take his allusion to metal, but there’s also drone influences à la Roly Porter, and minimalist composition à la William Basinski &amp; Steve Reich (with whom Coates has previously collaborated). The result is a singular mélange of a headphone record that I found mesmerising.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-empress-of--im-your-empress-of\">18. Empress Of — <em>I’m Your Empress Of</em></h3>\n<p>Despite this being her third record, Lorely Rodriguez—as Empress Of—is a new artist to me this year. She also, drum roll, made my favourite track of the year in the form of peerless, euphoric dance banger ‘Love is a Drug’. But that’s just one of the jewels on offer here. The album’s true opener (though it follows a sweet intro) ‘Bit of Rain’ is a house-infused treat, whereas ‘Shold’ve’ is a more complex, layered affair.</p>\n<p>Only three tracks break the three-minute barrier, and the album as a whole is only a little over a half hour, content to show up, put a smile on your face, and dip out leaving you wanting more. This was a trip I took dozens of times since the record’s release back in spring, and I’ll be playing it for a while yet. I’ll also be looking out both for remixes of what’s here, and for what Rodriguez does next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-phoebe-bridgers--punisher\">17. Phoebe Bridgers — <em>Punisher</em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someday, I&rsquo;m gonna live<br>\nIn your house up on the hill<br>\nAnd when your skinhead neighbor goes missing<br>\nI&rsquo;ll plant a garden in the yard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those are the first lines delivered on <em>Punisher</em>, and a fitting testament to the fact that no one told more compelling stories on record this year than Phoebe Bridgers. A stellar lyricist, she paints a series of vivid pictures for the listener, then uses them as the setting for raw emotional openness. It’s the same formula used by her partner in Better Oblivion Community Center: one Conor Oberst. But Bridgers is painting with softer brushes and – for the most part – a darker palette.</p>\n<p>The title track is a heart-rending ballad of loneliness, ‘Kyoto’ is a more up-beat invitation to sing along (if you can match Bridgers’ range), and album highlight ‘Savior Complex’ is a brilliantly judged balancing act that manages to be both delicate and devastating.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason Better Oblivion Community Center didn’t really work for me last year, but <em>Punisher</em> is persuasive proof that I need to go back to Bridgers’ solo debut (<em>Stranger in the Alps</em> (2017)), and also her work with Lucy Dacus in boygenius.</p>\n<p>Side note: Bridgers’ non-album <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JKPaA3p3bJU\">cover of Radiohead’s ‘Fake Plastic Trees’</a> (with Arlo Parks) is outstanding.</p>\n<p>Second side note: despite its June release I was late in coming to this album for whatever reason, and I get the distinct feeling it’s not done growing on me. Ask me in 6-12 months and this may well have climbed up a fair few places.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-holy-fuck--deleter\">16. Holy Fuck — <em>Deleter</em></h3>\n<p>HF took 7th place on this list in 2016 with their previous album: <em>Congrats</em>. I never did do the work of going back and exploring their catalogue — which is something I still <em>should</em> do — but when I saw a new LP drop at the beginning of 2020 I jumped on it. This is a record that has stuck around for me all year, and which doesn’t sound like anything else on this list.</p>\n<p>HF are a band doing their own thing in their own way: bending all manner of instruments to make a supreme electronic racket with a pulse. However, the guests on <em>Deleter</em>’s opening couple of tracks make for an interesting way of triangulating the band’s place on the musical map. The understated build and break of ‘Luxe’ features Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and the more forthright follow-up of a title track includes Angus Andrew of Liars. (I made an additional comparison to Battles last time, and that still stands.)</p>\n<p>My favourite track on an inventive, restless record is ‘Moment’, with its build-and-build again dynamic and krautrock hard edge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-surfer-blood--carefree-theatre\">15. Surfer Blood — <em>Carefree Theatre</em></h3>\n<p>The last two Surfer Blood records (<em>1000 Palms</em> (2015) &amp; <em>Snowdonia</em> (2017)) haven’t found a spot in my top 20, though I remember enjoying both of them. Happily, <em>Carefree Theatre</em> is very much a return to the heights of <em>Pythons</em> (18th in 2013), if not quite <em>Astro Coast</em> (6th in 2010).</p>\n<p>The sunny Florida quartet still have a way with a simple melody, decorated with pretty harmonics, and a knack for undercutting it all with a weirdly twisted lyric or unexpected shift in the tune (eg. the way the guitar line finds an unexpected low note on ‘Parkland (Into Silence)’). I’m aware that I may be being influenced by the fact they have a song referencing the director, but there’s a Lynchian twist at play here: a dive from the white picket vista to the squirming bugs in the soil. It’s the gambit Pixies perfected several decades ago, but it’s nice to hear a different take on it.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done the work of going back to the third and fourth records, but I expect I would find that they were weakened relatively by virtue of Surfer Blood stretching to expand their sound. Simplicity is this band’s friend, and seems key to the bright three-minute pieces they’re capable of crafting. On this record they’re embracing it with great results, even if album closer ‘Rose Bowl’ makes for disconcerting listening at the end of 2020:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the first day of the New Year<br>\nMorning, January first<br>\nThis past year wasn’t great<br>\nAnd I think it’s getting worse</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"14-biffy-clyro--a-celebration-of-endings\">14. Biffy Clyro — <em>A Celebration of Endings</em></h3>\n<p>Previously on this list: 9th in 2007 with <em>Puzzle</em>; 3rd in 2013 with <em>Opposites</em> and, of course, 1st in 2009 with <em>Only Revolutions</em>. Notable for its absence in that list is 2016’s <em>Ellipsis</em>, which I found to be uneven at best and did not get played much after the first couple of listens. For that reason I approached <em>A Celebration of Endings</em> with both hope and caution. I was very pleased to find that it was the former that was warranted.</p>\n<p>‘North is No South’ is a statement of intent, and then it gives way to a run of four tracks (‘The Champ’ – ‘Worst Type of Best Possible’) as strong as anything the Scots have ever committed to tape. ‘Space’ is the kind of ballad that probably has Matt Cardle dreaming of another Christmas number 1, and then ‘End Of’ hits you over the head with a blackjack. As was the case with the previous three Biffy albums to make this list there’s not a bad track here. There are weaker moments (‘The Pink Limit’ doesn’t totally work for me), but they’re hugely outnumbered by consistently arresting songwriting and the band’s knack for finding strange new ways to twist a riff or subvert a time signature.</p>\n<p>That’s true from the the bruiser of an opening track, right until ‘Cop Syrup’ plays the record out like a weird update of Nirvana’s ‘Beeswax’ (1992).</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-the-beths--jump-rope-gazers\">13. The Beths — <em>Jump Rope Gazers</em></h3>\n<p>There were so many good records two years ago that I ended up appending a ‘next best 30’ list to the main top 20 – that’s how I know that The Beths’ fuzzed-up guitars and playful percussion only just missed a spot on the 2018 list for their debut <em>Future Me Hates Me</em>. The follow-up is a stronger record on which the New Zealand quartet have honed their formidable sense of melody to a fine point.</p>\n<p>I’m hearing some that dog. in here, only Elizabeth Stokes’s voice is warmer and lighter than Anna Waronker’s delivery often was. Moments like the vocal somersaults on opener ‘I’m Not Getting Excited’ still thrill me on each listen.</p>\n<p>There’s a little dip in quality at the middle of the running order, but it picks right back up with the cheerily plaintive ‘Don’t Go Away’, before heading into album highlight ‘Mars, The God of War’: a sub-three-minute pop rock gem and the best song I know to include the word ‘optometry’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-deftones--ohms\">12. Deftones — <em>Ohms</em></h3>\n<p>As I type this there is a newly released version of Deftones’ best record sat, as yet unheard, on my hard drive. <em>White Pony / Black Stallion</em> is a remaster and a set of remixes in celebration of the 20th anniversary of an album that I would still pack for a desert island.</p>\n<p>Deftones are one of the very few bands for whom every one of their records has made my list over the years, so let’s review placements:</p>\n<p><em>White Pony</em> 3rd in 2000 ☨<br>\n<em>Deftones</em> 12th in 2003;<br>\n<em>Saturday Night Wrist</em> 9th in 2006;<br>\n<em>Diamond Eyes</em> 9th in 2010;<br>\n<em>Koi No Yokan</em> 1st in 2012;<br>\n<em>Gore</em> 20th in 2016</p>\n<p>When I looked back on the preceding decade in 2005 I also retroactively had their debut <em>Adrenaline</em> 1st for 1995, and the follow-up <em>Around the Fur</em> 3rd for 1997.</p>\n<p>But what of the new offering? After flirtations with Bob Ezrin, Nick Raskulinecz, &amp; Matt Hyde on their last four albums, Deftones reunite here with Terry Date: the producer on their first four albums. The result is a record that sounds every bit as brutal and sonically deep as their masterpiece. There’s proof on every track of <em>Ohms</em> that this is a band still able to wrangle cacophony like no one else, threading it through with both taut wires of urgent passion and flowing ribbons of melody.</p>\n<p>‘Urantia’ is a Pantera riff being absorbed into a great lost Soundgarden song; ‘Radiant City’ is restless water chopped up by a sea monster moving slowly in the deep. And, title track and closer ‘Ohms’, is the best song they’ve written in two decades.</p>\n<p>☨ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m relatively confident that if I reviewed this year now <em>White Pony</em> would take 2nd from Eminem’s <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em> and would be snapping at the heels of Radiohead’s <em>Kid A</em> for the top spot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"11-fiona-apple--fetch-the-bolt-cutters\">11. Fiona Apple — <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know where to begin with this record. After having listened to it dozens of times I still feel like I’m barely finding my way into it. And yet it’s mesmerising and breathtaking in new ways each time I give it the attention it deserves – which is to say, when I can lie down with headphones on and do nothing else.</p>\n<p>Apple’s previous album (<em>The Idler Wheel…</em>) ended up 17th on my list in 2012, but only four other records on that list have lasted for me over the eight years since. I’m old friends with that album now, I know the raucous ‘Every Single Night’ and the dizzying ‘Hot Knife’ like old friends. But I still recall when I first encountered the album, and how it took time before confusion gave way to awe. Fiona Apple doesn’t make easily digestible, parseable music. But just as years spent loving <em>Extraordinary Machine</em> (2005) were inadequate preparation for <em>Idler Wheel…</em>, eight years spent in the company of that album wasn’t enough to get my brain ready for <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>.</p>\n<p>That’s two paragraphs of preamble to mask the fact that I still don’t really know how to talk about this record, except to say that by the time Apple starts making dolphin noises in the last 20 seconds of opener ‘I Want You To Love Me’, you’re likely either in or out. I, evidently, was in all the way: through the anthem to self belief ‘Shameika’, the self confidence mantra ‘Under the Table’, or the howl in the face of depression ‘Heavy Balloon’.</p>\n<p>There is a book to be written about the instrumentation on <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>, the way it’s layered, the way Apple’s voice (often in duplicate or triplicate) weaves in and out of it, the way it seems to fly in the face of conventional time signatures to create music that keeps you guessing even on the fifteenth listen. I’m not music scholar enough to attempt anything close to the analysis this record deserves. This is the best way I can find to phrase it: nothing sounds like a Fiona Apple record, and no other Fiona Apple record sounds quite like this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-four-tet--sixteen-oceans\">10. Four Tet — <em>Sixteen Oceans</em></h3>\n<p>It will be no surprise to find Kieran Hebden occupying a place on this list: previous appearances include <em>There is Love in You</em> (17th in 2010); <em>Pink</em> (10th in 2012); &amp; <em>New Energy</em> (7th in 2017), and I have a feeling that if I were to rewrite the 2013 list now <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> would make an appearance – it’s certainly had more staying power for me than a number of records on that list. Heck, I still play 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> at least a couple of times each year.</p>\n<p><em>Sixteen Oceans</em> displays the same delicate balances with which Four Tet has been playing for more than two decades: electronic / acoustic; played / sampled; digital / human. These levels shift pleasingly and subtly throughout the runtime of the record, in a manner which made it for me very much an album as opposed to a collection of disparate tracks. As I replayed it, even the four shorter interstitial pieces came to feel like necessary, brilliantly judged transitional moments.</p>\n<p>Highlights for me are the singular pulse of ‘Teenage Birdsong’, and the glowing swell of (the otherwise admittedly slight) ‘4T Recordings’. Arguably there’s less innovation on <em>Sixteen Oceans</em> than there has been on previous Four Tet albums, but I don’t necessarily miss it. I still find Hebden’s work captivating, moving, and worthy of frequent revisiting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-caribou--suddenly\">9. Caribou — <em>Suddenly</em></h3>\n<p>Caribou previously appeared on one of these lists when he took 11th place in 2014 with <em>Our Love</em>. That was a record that tapped into hazy house music vibes to great effect, and there are still notes of that in evidence on this year’s release. Overall, however, <em>Suddenly</em> is more wide-ranging. It borrows from all over the dance / electronica spectrum, and unifies the results by threading the patchwork through with Dan Snaith’s falsetto.</p>\n<p>Album highlight ‘Home’ is as soulful and warm as opener ‘Sister’ is cool and stand-offish: both are sub-three minute musical jewels. Each track here has been painstakingly constructed from a broad array of influences, such that each sounds different from one another and yet uniquely like Caribou. It’s a similar art to that practiced by (former tour mates) Radiohead: somehow you know a piece of music is theirs even when it sounds unlike anything they’ve made before. Amongst my favourite tracks on the record, ‘Never Come Back’ &amp; ‘Ravi’ are imbued with the kind of warmth that just glows through your headphones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-haim--women-in-music-pt-iii\">8. HAIM — <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em></h3>\n<p>HAIM’s last album — <em>Something To Tell You</em> — didn’t find a spot on my 2017 list. Despite a handful of very good tracks, and no outright bad ones, it never seemed to reach anything like the heights of the debut: <em>Days Are Gone</em>, which was awarded 6th place back in 2013. Even on first listen it was clear to me that on <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em> HAIM had recaptured the magic of their debut.</p>\n<p>The formula should be familiar now: three gifted musicians who also hold the unfair advantage of being sisters, which seems to explain why their voices harmonise so perfectly. Using those tools, and a great ear for melodic hooks, they produce a more thoroughly Californian update of Fleetwood Mac’s blues-infused pop-rock.</p>\n<p>And on their third LP they’re making some of their best music. ‘The Steps’ is forthright and foot-stomping; its younger sister – album closer ‘FUBT’ – is a more vulnerable lament. And HAIM are happy and able to play anywhere along that spectrum. Album highlight ‘Don’t Wanna’ is both achingly sweet and vulnerable whilst its percussion and soaring chorus project a core of strength.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple of surprises that work surprisingly well: chief amongst them ‘3am’, which sounds like it fell off a Jennifer Lopez record a couple of decades ago, and which I couldn’t get enough of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-georgia--seeking-thrills\">7. Georgia — <em>Seeking Thrills</em></h3>\n<p>Only two of the dozen nominees for this year’s Mercury Music Prize also has the (no less prestigious) honour of being awarded a place in my top 20.</p>\n<p><em>Seeking Thrills</em> is one of the year’s most optimistic records; it’s awash with infectious positivity. There are certainly downtempo moments, such as the coy, understated self-belief mantra ‘Till I Own It’, but there are several tracks obviously destined to soundtrack late night and early hours on dancefloors. The chorus of ‘Never Let You Go’ is a burst of beautiful euphoria set in a polyrhythmic bed that’s urging you to dance at two different tempos at once; ‘Feel It’ has the DNA of an MIA track, but with a dance twist; ’24 Hours’ evolves masterfully into an effervescent gem.</p>\n<p>The first half of the album is stronger than the latter half, but there are no weak tracks. Since its release in the second week of the year this has been an easy-listening pleasure that I’ve yet to tire of replaying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-taylor-swift--evermore\">6. Taylor Swift — <em>evermore</em></h3>\n<p>This has been the year of disrupted plans and unforeseen twists. Thus it’s fitting that I had this whole list written before Taylor Swift decided to celebrate her birthday by surprise releasing an album, with ~16 hours' notice, on 11 December. Hence, two weeks’ later, here I am on Boxing Day re-writing things to give this record its rightful place.</p>\n<p>As with her other quarantine album (July’s <em>folklore</em>) this is Swift in a storytelling mode, delicately and precisely teasing out the emotional truths of any situation she turns her attention to: failed proposals on ‘champagne problems’, imbalances of affection within relationships on ‘tolerate it’ . She’s telling the story of her own grandmother on ‘marjorie’, and spinning a tale of murder and revenge on the HAIM-featuring ‘No Body, No Crime’ – both the most fun Swift had on record this year, and her catchiest song of 2020.</p>\n<p>Sonically though, there’s more of a sense of exploration here than on Swift’s other 2020 release. The template of simply arranged, delicately composed folk pop that was set on <em>folklore</em> is pulled here into slightly different shapes. There’s a drum machine on ‘one story short’, and skittering beats and whooshes underneath the outro of ‘happiness’, and again throughout ‘closure’. There’s one of the clearest nods to her country music roots since <em>Speak Now</em> (2010) on ‘cowboy like me’.</p>\n<p>You can probably tell from how this entry is written that, with five entries left to go, we’re not done with Taylor Swift in 2020. I’ll have more to say then.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Also: shout out to the Detroit post-hardcore quartet Dogleg who held the 20th spot on this list before Taylor dropped a last minute bombshell, necessitating a re-write; their debut <em>Melee</em> is officially my twenty-first favourite LP of 2020.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"5-hayley-williams--petals-for-armor\">5. Hayley Williams — <em>Petals for Armor</em></h3>\n<p>The last three Paramore records have been at four year intervals (not that I’m counting down), and they’ve reliably taken their place in the middle of my lists: 8th in 2009 for <em>Brand New Eyes</em>, 12th in 2013 for <em>Paramore</em>, and 10th in 2017 with <em>After Laughter</em>. As such it’s a welcome surprise to find frontwoman Hayley Williams so far up this list when she’s out on her own.</p>\n<p>Musically this solo work is less vibrantly bombastic than Paramore’s more recent output, but no less catchy or endearing. Despite deeply personal subject matter (including depression, divorce, and recovery) Williams has crafted a collection of electronic-tinged pop-rock that it’s impossible not to fall for. Over the course of 15 tracks she explores some more experimental percussion and production (such as on the stuttering-then-flowing, Fiona Apple-esque ‘Cinnamon’) as well as showcasing her ear for a hook, such as on the powerful earworm ‘Dead Horse’ and the Sunday-afternoon radio ballad ‘Pure Love’. The result is an hour of consistently arresting, energising music that draws from an impressively wide emotional range.</p>\n<p>Few would deny that the defining characteristic of Paramore as a band is Hayley Williams’s unmistakable voice. Whisper to roar, and across a truly impressive tonal range, few rock singers can match her. Unsurprisingly that is also the strength of her first solo outing, though her consistently evolving songwriting is a close second.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-beach-bunny--honeymoon\">4. Beach Bunny — <em>Honeymoon</em></h3>\n<p>This record is nine tracks and 25 minutes of relentless, sunny pop-rock. It’s proof if proof was needed that throwing four kids into a rehearsal room with a couple of guitars and a drum set can still result in something life-affirming and marvellous.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Promises’ is first light and bubbly, and then strident and anthemic; it’s followed up with the sing-along whilst you dance-along ‘Cuffing Season’, then we drop a couple of gears for the raw, earnest ‘April’. And we’re off to the races on a giddy whirlwind tour of three-chords-and-hummable-choruses pop. By the time you reach cartwheeling closer, and album high point, ‘Cloud 9’ you’re ready to do it all again. Go on, treat yourself. You can find 25 minutes.</p>\n<p>I’m a simple man, and Weezer’s self-titled debut is my seventh-favourite record of all time. I needed something this bright and uncomplicated this year, and my thanks go out to this Chicago quartet for delivering it so effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-taylor-swift--folklore\">3. Taylor Swift — <em>folklore</em></h3>\n<p>Last year’s number one released this record with 24 hours’ notice back in July, and it has been a staple on my headphones ever since. A very different-sounding record to 2019’s <em>Lover</em>, working (for the most part) in a more subdued register, <em>folklore</em> is another showcase for a phenomenal songwriting talent. There are no anthemic, danceable pop explosions here, but the more muted tone and stripped back instrumentation allow for Swift’s vocals to shine, and for her lyricism to take centre stage.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s (on ‘The Last Great American Dynasty’) telling the story of Rebekah Harkness, who used to live in the home Swift now owns, or laying out the dynamics of a love triangle over the course of three songs (‘Cardigan’, ‘August’, &amp; ‘Betty’), Swift displays a songwriting touch as light and dextrous as the voice with which she brings those songs to life. Album highlight for me (at least at present) is Swift’s duet with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon on ‘Exile’ - a lyrically exquisite heartbreaker wherein the two voices play with and against one another perfectly.</p>\n<p>Following the surprise release of the album, Swift also put out a combination making-of documentary / live performance on Disney+ which offered insight on how the record came to be, and how her collaboration with The National’s Aaron Dessner came to bear this fruit. It also serves as an interesting document of how an artist usually wrapped in layers of hype and marketing, found freedom in isolation to make something intimate. The record is a fascinating balance: it represents the furthest Swift has gone into telling others’ stories (fictional and otherwise), yet each song is imbued with deeply personal feeling.</p>\n<p>Swift’s work in 2020 has been, frankly, stunning - as evidenced by her having performed the unprecedented feat of securing two spots in the top six places of this list. Having stepped outside of both the aesthetic trappings and sonic bombast usually expected of pop’s reigning queen, she has made a strong case for being recognised as a generational songwriting talent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-halsey--manic\">2. Halsey — <em>Manic</em></h3>\n<p>When you open your third record on a song titled with your given name (‘Ashley’) you’re making a statement: I’m here to share something; this is coming from the heart. When you close that track with a snippet of audio from <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, you’re signalling an emotional register of earnest vulnerability. Carrying off that conversation over the course of 16 pop songs is a tall order, and yet <em>Manic</em> is an unbridled success.</p>\n<p>Someone smarter than me could probably take the musical DNA of ‘Forever … (is a long time)’ / ‘Dominic’s Interlude’ / ‘I HATE EVERYBODY’, examine it under an electron microscope, and figure out why it makes me feel the same way as sections of My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> (2006). I’m not equipped to work out the reasons, I can just tell you that it happens. The first track uses piano to effect a shift from major to minor key; the second is an organ-backed, multi-tracked, 76 second opera;  the third is a series of crescendos hitting like waves on a beach. It’s a masterful seven minutes at the centre of a bewilderingly good record.</p>\n<p>Oh, and then the second half of the record kicks off with the barnstorming pop-rock ‘3am’, and then the dimly lit, sultry ‘Without Me’, then the lost KT Tunstall track I didn’t know I wanted: ‘Finally // beautiful stranger’. By the time Halsey is singing an LGBT empowerment duet with Alanis Morissette you feel it’s company they should feel comfortable keeping.</p>\n<p>Folk, pop, indie rock, R&amp;B, Korean rap - this record includes a lot, and some reviews read that as coming at the expense of depth. For me it all works seamlessly almost without exception, making <em>Manic</em> read like a personal, and deeply felt record, that also happens to be a pop gem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-dua-lipa--future-nostalgia\">1. Dua Lipa — <em>Future Nostalgia</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s the other Mercury nominee, and (I have just learned) Spotify’s most played female artist of 2020. So firmly is the 2020 pop crown sat atop Dua’s head that one of her best tracks of the year isn’t even on this record, it’s over on Miley Cyrus’s <em>Plastic Hearts</em> - the high point of an album that very nearly made this list.</p>\n<p>Whilst Taylor Swift was writing folk ballads in a woodland cabin it seems Dua was channeling the attentions of the pop gods to teach a neon-soaked masterclass in funk and disco-infused bangers. This is music designed in a lab to destroy radios, dance floors, and TikTok alike. All of which would be for nothing if it wasn’t, from start to finish, an unmitigated success. You cannot fail to smile, you absolutely will nod along, sing along, and feel some of these beats in your bones.</p>\n<p>The Pitchfork review of <em>Future Nostalgia</em> has a good line in which they say that the album ‘sounds like three Madonna eras at once’. As someone who has a huge amount of affection for pretty much all of Madonna’s eras (not you <em>American Life</em>, you can sit down) this is a recipe for success in my mind. Providing, that is, that you can walk in Madonna’s shadow – not an easy thing to do. Dua comes armed with the disco beats of peak Kylie, and a faultless ear for both a groove and a beat. The result is a remarkable pop record that samples White Town on ‘Love Again’, and channels John Deacon on ‘Break My Heart’, but also sounds entirely cohesive and possessed of limitless self-confidence.</p>\n<p>The title track, ‘Don’t Start Now’, ‘Physical’, ‘Hallucinate’, and ‘Break My Heart’ could each be career-defining encores for a lot of artists. As it stands, I get the feeling that this is just the beginning of what Dua Lipa is capable of.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This is the second year that my list has been topped by a thoroughbred pop record, and there are more albums elsewhere on the list this year than ever before which fall in that category. What I find particularly interesting is that the great bulk of my music-listening year is taken up with records from all over the genre map. At the time of writing I’ve listened to 213 records released in 2020 at least once through. From ambient and drone to jazz and metal I found records this year that I really enjoyed. But when the chips are down and I have to pick the records that genuinely gave me the most pleasure, increasingly it’s pop music that I turn to. Perhaps two years in a row is a coincidence, but even if the 2021 list doesn’t end up having a pop album on top I’ll be shocked if there isn’t a handful of them in the mix.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Joywave — *Possession*\n\nThree years ago Joywave announced themselves to me, and took second place on my 2017 list, with their sophomore album *Content*. At the time I said that I found the band ‘very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent’ and guess what? *Possession* is another assured, multi-faceted set of a dozen uncategorisable bops. Of the previous record I listed the genres touched upon as ‘including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…’ and that’s still all in the mix here though, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on the new album feels slightly more humane and less coldly electronic than its predecessor. \n\nOpener ‘Like a Kennedy’ is, for me, one of the defining songs of the Trump / Brexit era: a vulnerable, exhausted lament that asks only for the simplest things amidst incomprehensible turmoil. ‘F.E.A.R.’ twists ‘Monster Mash’ DNA into a campy downbeat stomp, whereas ‘Funny Thing About Opinions’ is an upbeat treatise on the state of internet dialogue.\n\nThis is another record of surprising, inventive dance-pop-rock cuts that was everything I wanted from more Joywave. I would love to see these guys live when that’s possible once more, though—with the same sense of humour apparent in their music—the band’s faux-Fox News website informs me that their touring has been postponed ‘due to pressure from health experts and communists’. \n\n###  19. Oliver Coates — *skins n slime*\n\nOn my spider-diagram of musical influences there would be a large number of lines spreading outwards from Radiohead, and Oliver Coates is the newest addition. It seems like a fitting way to encounter a classically trained cellist making something he’s called (probably with tongue firmly in cheek) ‘pastoral metal’. \n\nIt’s a tough task to affix meaningful labels to what Coates is doing on *skins n slime*, and that’s not a bad thing. Sure, I take his allusion to metal, but there’s also drone influences à la Roly Porter, and minimalist composition à la William Basinski & Steve Reich (with whom Coates has previously collaborated). The result is a singular mélange of a headphone record that I found mesmerising.\n\n###  18. Empress Of — *I’m Your Empress Of*\n\nDespite this being her third record, Lorely Rodriguez—as Empress Of—is a new artist to me this year. She also, drum roll, made my favourite track of the year in the form of peerless, euphoric dance banger ‘Love is a Drug’. But that’s just one of the jewels on offer here. The album’s true opener (though it follows a sweet intro) ‘Bit of Rain’ is a house-infused treat, whereas ‘Shold’ve’ is a more complex, layered affair. \n\nOnly three tracks break the three-minute barrier, and the album as a whole is only a little over a half hour, content to show up, put a smile on your face, and dip out leaving you wanting more. This was a trip I took dozens of times since the record’s release back in spring, and I’ll be playing it for a while yet. I’ll also be looking out both for remixes of what’s here, and for what Rodriguez does next. \n\n###  17. Phoebe Bridgers — *Punisher*\n\n> Someday, I'm gonna live  \n> In your house up on the hill  \n> And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing  \n> I'll plant a garden in the yard  \n\nThose are the first lines delivered on *Punisher*, and a fitting testament to the fact that no one told more compelling stories on record this year than Phoebe Bridgers. A stellar lyricist, she paints a series of vivid pictures for the listener, then uses them as the setting for raw emotional openness. It’s the same formula used by her partner in Better Oblivion Community Center: one Conor Oberst. But Bridgers is painting with softer brushes and – for the most part – a darker palette. \n\nThe title track is a heart-rending ballad of loneliness, ‘Kyoto’ is a more up-beat invitation to sing along (if you can match Bridgers’ range), and album highlight ‘Savior Complex’ is a brilliantly judged balancing act that manages to be both delicate and devastating. \n\nFor whatever reason Better Oblivion Community Center didn’t really work for me last year, but *Punisher* is persuasive proof that I need to go back to Bridgers’ solo debut (*Stranger in the Alps* (2017)), and also her work with Lucy Dacus in boygenius.   \n  \nSide note: Bridgers’ non-album [cover of Radiohead’s ‘Fake Plastic Trees’](https://youtu.be/JKPaA3p3bJU) (with Arlo Parks) is outstanding.  \n\nSecond side note: despite its June release I was late in coming to this album for whatever reason, and I get the distinct feeling it’s not done growing on me. Ask me in 6-12 months and this may well have climbed up a fair few places.\n\n###  16. Holy Fuck — *Deleter*\n\nHF took 7th place on this list in 2016 with their previous album: *Congrats*. I never did do the work of going back and exploring their catalogue — which is something I still *should* do — but when I saw a new LP drop at the beginning of 2020 I jumped on it. This is a record that has stuck around for me all year, and which doesn’t sound like anything else on this list. \n\nHF are a band doing their own thing in their own way: bending all manner of instruments to make a supreme electronic racket with a pulse. However, the guests on *Deleter*’s opening couple of tracks make for an interesting way of triangulating the band’s place on the musical map. The understated build and break of ‘Luxe’ features Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and the more forthright follow-up of a title track includes Angus Andrew of Liars. (I made an additional comparison to Battles last time, and that still stands.) \n\nMy favourite track on an inventive, restless record is ‘Moment’, with its build-and-build again dynamic and krautrock hard edge. \n\n###  15. Surfer Blood — *Carefree Theatre*\n\nThe last two Surfer Blood records (*1000 Palms* (2015) & *Snowdonia* (2017)) haven’t found a spot in my top 20, though I remember enjoying both of them. Happily, *Carefree Theatre* is very much a return to the heights of *Pythons* (18th in 2013), if not quite *Astro Coast* (6th in 2010). \n\nThe sunny Florida quartet still have a way with a simple melody, decorated with pretty harmonics, and a knack for undercutting it all with a weirdly twisted lyric or unexpected shift in the tune (eg. the way the guitar line finds an unexpected low note on ‘Parkland (Into Silence)’). I’m aware that I may be being influenced by the fact they have a song referencing the director, but there’s a Lynchian twist at play here: a dive from the white picket vista to the squirming bugs in the soil. It’s the gambit Pixies perfected several decades ago, but it’s nice to hear a different take on it. \n\nI haven’t done the work of going back to the third and fourth records, but I expect I would find that they were weakened relatively by virtue of Surfer Blood stretching to expand their sound. Simplicity is this band’s friend, and seems key to the bright three-minute pieces they’re capable of crafting. On this record they’re embracing it with great results, even if album closer ‘Rose Bowl’ makes for disconcerting listening at the end of 2020:\n\n> On the first day of the New Year  \n> Morning, January first  \n> This past year wasn’t great  \n> And I think it’s getting worse  \n\n###  14. Biffy Clyro — *A Celebration of Endings*\n\nPreviously on this list: 9th in 2007 with *Puzzle*; 3rd in 2013 with *Opposites* and, of course, 1st in 2009 with *Only Revolutions*. Notable for its absence in that list is 2016’s *Ellipsis*, which I found to be uneven at best and did not get played much after the first couple of listens. For that reason I approached *A Celebration of Endings* with both hope and caution. I was very pleased to find that it was the former that was warranted. \n\n‘North is No South’ is a statement of intent, and then it gives way to a run of four tracks (‘The Champ’ – ‘Worst Type of Best Possible’) as strong as anything the Scots have ever committed to tape. ‘Space’ is the kind of ballad that probably has Matt Cardle dreaming of another Christmas number 1, and then ‘End Of’ hits you over the head with a blackjack. As was the case with the previous three Biffy albums to make this list there’s not a bad track here. There are weaker moments (‘The Pink Limit’ doesn’t totally work for me), but they’re hugely outnumbered by consistently arresting songwriting and the band’s knack for finding strange new ways to twist a riff or subvert a time signature. \n\nThat’s true from the the bruiser of an opening track, right until ‘Cop Syrup’ plays the record out like a weird update of Nirvana’s ‘Beeswax’ (1992). \n\n### 13. The Beths — *Jump Rope Gazers*\n\nThere were so many good records two years ago that I ended up appending a ‘next best 30’ list to the main top 20 – that’s how I know that The Beths’ fuzzed-up guitars and playful percussion only just missed a spot on the 2018 list for their debut *Future Me Hates Me*. The follow-up is a stronger record on which the New Zealand quartet have honed their formidable sense of melody to a fine point. \n\nI’m hearing some that dog. in here, only Elizabeth Stokes’s voice is warmer and lighter than Anna Waronker’s delivery often was. Moments like the vocal somersaults on opener ‘I’m Not Getting Excited’ still thrill me on each listen.\n\nThere’s a little dip in quality at the middle of the running order, but it picks right back up with the cheerily plaintive ‘Don’t Go Away’, before heading into album highlight ‘Mars, The God of War’: a sub-three-minute pop rock gem and the best song I know to include the word ‘optometry’. \n\n###  12. Deftones — *Ohms*\n\nAs I type this there is a newly released version of Deftones’ best record sat, as yet unheard, on my hard drive. *White Pony / Black Stallion* is a remaster and a set of remixes in celebration of the 20th anniversary of an album that I would still pack for a desert island.  \n\nDeftones are one of the very few bands for whom every one of their records has made my list over the years, so let’s review placements:   \n\n*White Pony* 3rd in 2000 ☨  \n*Deftones* 12th in 2003;  \n*Saturday Night Wrist* 9th in 2006;  \n*Diamond Eyes* 9th in 2010;  \n*Koi No Yokan* 1st in 2012;  \n*Gore* 20th in 2016  \n\nWhen I looked back on the preceding decade in 2005 I also retroactively had their debut *Adrenaline* 1st for 1995, and the follow-up *Around the Fur* 3rd for 1997.\n  \nBut what of the new offering? After flirtations with Bob Ezrin, Nick Raskulinecz, & Matt Hyde on their last four albums, Deftones reunite here with Terry Date: the producer on their first four albums. The result is a record that sounds every bit as brutal and sonically deep as their masterpiece. There’s proof on every track of *Ohms* that this is a band still able to wrangle cacophony like no one else, threading it through with both taut wires of urgent passion and flowing ribbons of melody. \n\n‘Urantia’ is a Pantera riff being absorbed into a great lost Soundgarden song; ‘Radiant City’ is restless water chopped up by a sea monster moving slowly in the deep. And, title track and closer ‘Ohms’, is the best song they’ve written in two decades. \n\n☨ <font color=\"#cfcfcf\">I’m relatively confident that if I reviewed this year now *White Pony* would take 2nd from Eminem’s *The Marshall Mathers LP* and would be snapping at the heels of Radiohead’s *Kid A* for the top spot.</font>\n\n###  11. Fiona Apple — *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*\n\nI don’t know where to begin with this record. After having listened to it dozens of times I still feel like I’m barely finding my way into it. And yet it’s mesmerising and breathtaking in new ways each time I give it the attention it deserves – which is to say, when I can lie down with headphones on and do nothing else.\n\nApple’s previous album (*The Idler Wheel…*) ended up 17th on my list in 2012, but only four other records on that list have lasted for me over the eight years since. I’m old friends with that album now, I know the raucous ‘Every Single Night’ and the dizzying ‘Hot Knife’ like old friends. But I still recall when I first encountered the album, and how it took time before confusion gave way to awe. Fiona Apple doesn’t make easily digestible, parseable music. But just as years spent loving *Extraordinary Machine* (2005) were inadequate preparation for *Idler Wheel…*, eight years spent in the company of that album wasn’t enough to get my brain ready for *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*.\n\nThat’s two paragraphs of preamble to mask the fact that I still don’t really know how to talk about this record, except to say that by the time Apple starts making dolphin noises in the last 20 seconds of opener ‘I Want You To Love Me’, you’re likely either in or out. I, evidently, was in all the way: through the anthem to self belief ‘Shameika’, the self confidence mantra ‘Under the Table’, or the howl in the face of depression ‘Heavy Balloon’. \n\nThere is a book to be written about the instrumentation on *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*, the way it’s layered, the way Apple’s voice (often in duplicate or triplicate) weaves in and out of it, the way it seems to fly in the face of conventional time signatures to create music that keeps you guessing even on the fifteenth listen. I’m not music scholar enough to attempt anything close to the analysis this record deserves. This is the best way I can find to phrase it: nothing sounds like a Fiona Apple record, and no other Fiona Apple record sounds quite like this. \n\n###  10. Four Tet — *Sixteen Oceans*\n\nIt will be no surprise to find Kieran Hebden occupying a place on this list: previous appearances include *There is Love in You* (17th in 2010); *Pink* (10th in 2012); & *New Energy* (7th in 2017), and I have a feeling that if I were to rewrite the 2013 list now *Beautiful Rewind* would make an appearance – it’s certainly had more staying power for me than a number of records on that list. Heck, I still play 2003’s *Rounds* and 2005’s *Everything Ecstatic* at least a couple of times each year. \n\n*Sixteen Oceans* displays the same delicate balances with which Four Tet has been playing for more than two decades: electronic / acoustic; played / sampled; digital / human. These levels shift pleasingly and subtly throughout the runtime of the record, in a manner which made it for me very much an album as opposed to a collection of disparate tracks. As I replayed it, even the four shorter interstitial pieces came to feel like necessary, brilliantly judged transitional moments. \n\nHighlights for me are the singular pulse of ‘Teenage Birdsong’, and the glowing swell of (the otherwise admittedly slight) ‘4T Recordings’. Arguably there’s less innovation on *Sixteen Oceans* than there has been on previous Four Tet albums, but I don’t necessarily miss it. I still find Hebden’s work captivating, moving, and worthy of frequent revisiting.\n\n###  9. Caribou — *Suddenly*\n\nCaribou previously appeared on one of these lists when he took 11th place in 2014 with *Our Love*. That was a record that tapped into hazy house music vibes to great effect, and there are still notes of that in evidence on this year’s release. Overall, however, *Suddenly* is more wide-ranging. It borrows from all over the dance / electronica spectrum, and unifies the results by threading the patchwork through with Dan Snaith’s falsetto. \n\nAlbum highlight ‘Home’ is as soulful and warm as opener ‘Sister’ is cool and stand-offish: both are sub-three minute musical jewels. Each track here has been painstakingly constructed from a broad array of influences, such that each sounds different from one another and yet uniquely like Caribou. It’s a similar art to that practiced by (former tour mates) Radiohead: somehow you know a piece of music is theirs even when it sounds unlike anything they’ve made before. Amongst my favourite tracks on the record, ‘Never Come Back’ & ‘Ravi’ are imbued with the kind of warmth that just glows through your headphones.\n\n###  8. HAIM — *Women in Music Pt. III*\n\nHAIM’s last album — *Something To Tell You* — didn’t find a spot on my 2017 list. Despite a handful of very good tracks, and no outright bad ones, it never seemed to reach anything like the heights of the debut: *Days Are Gone*, which was awarded 6th place back in 2013. Even on first listen it was clear to me that on *Women in Music Pt. III* HAIM had recaptured the magic of their debut. \n\nThe formula should be familiar now: three gifted musicians who also hold the unfair advantage of being sisters, which seems to explain why their voices harmonise so perfectly. Using those tools, and a great ear for melodic hooks, they produce a more thoroughly Californian update of Fleetwood Mac’s blues-infused pop-rock. \n\nAnd on their third LP they’re making some of their best music. ‘The Steps’ is forthright and foot-stomping; its younger sister – album closer ‘FUBT’ – is a more vulnerable lament. And HAIM are happy and able to play anywhere along that spectrum. Album highlight ‘Don’t Wanna’ is both achingly sweet and vulnerable whilst its percussion and soaring chorus project a core of strength.   \n  \nThere are also a couple of surprises that work surprisingly well: chief amongst them ‘3am’, which sounds like it fell off a Jennifer Lopez record a couple of decades ago, and which I couldn’t get enough of. \n\n###  7. Georgia — *Seeking Thrills*\n\nOnly two of the dozen nominees for this year’s Mercury Music Prize also has the (no less prestigious) honour of being awarded a place in my top 20. \n\n*Seeking Thrills* is one of the year’s most optimistic records; it’s awash with infectious positivity. There are certainly downtempo moments, such as the coy, understated self-belief mantra ‘Till I Own It’, but there are several tracks obviously destined to soundtrack late night and early hours on dancefloors. The chorus of ‘Never Let You Go’ is a burst of beautiful euphoria set in a polyrhythmic bed that’s urging you to dance at two different tempos at once; ‘Feel It’ has the DNA of an MIA track, but with a dance twist; ’24 Hours’ evolves masterfully into an effervescent gem. \n\nThe first half of the album is stronger than the latter half, but there are no weak tracks. Since its release in the second week of the year this has been an easy-listening pleasure that I’ve yet to tire of replaying. \n\n###  6. Taylor Swift — *evermore*\n\nThis has been the year of disrupted plans and unforeseen twists. Thus it’s fitting that I had this whole list written before Taylor Swift decided to celebrate her birthday by surprise releasing an album, with ~16 hours' notice, on 11 December. Hence, two weeks’ later, here I am on Boxing Day re-writing things to give this record its rightful place. \n\nAs with her other quarantine album (July’s *folklore*) this is Swift in a storytelling mode, delicately and precisely teasing out the emotional truths of any situation she turns her attention to: failed proposals on ‘champagne problems’, imbalances of affection within relationships on ‘tolerate it’ . She’s telling the story of her own grandmother on ‘marjorie’, and spinning a tale of murder and revenge on the HAIM-featuring ‘No Body, No Crime’ – both the most fun Swift had on record this year, and her catchiest song of 2020.\n\nSonically though, there’s more of a sense of exploration here than on Swift’s other 2020 release. The template of simply arranged, delicately composed folk pop that was set on *folklore* is pulled here into slightly different shapes. There’s a drum machine on ‘one story short’, and skittering beats and whooshes underneath the outro of ‘happiness’, and again throughout ‘closure’. There’s one of the clearest nods to her country music roots since *Speak Now* (2010) on ‘cowboy like me’.\n\nYou can probably tell from how this entry is written that, with five entries left to go, we’re not done with Taylor Swift in 2020. I’ll have more to say then.\n\n<font color=\"#cfcfcf\">(Also: shout out to the Detroit post-hardcore quartet Dogleg who held the 20th spot on this list before Taylor dropped a last minute bombshell, necessitating a re-write; their debut *Melee* is officially my twenty-first favourite LP of 2020.)</font>\n\n###  5. Hayley Williams — *Petals for Armor*\n\nThe last three Paramore records have been at four year intervals (not that I’m counting down), and they’ve reliably taken their place in the middle of my lists: 8th in 2009 for *Brand New Eyes*, 12th in 2013 for *Paramore*, and 10th in 2017 with *After Laughter*. As such it’s a welcome surprise to find frontwoman Hayley Williams so far up this list when she’s out on her own.\n\nMusically this solo work is less vibrantly bombastic than Paramore’s more recent output, but no less catchy or endearing. Despite deeply personal subject matter (including depression, divorce, and recovery) Williams has crafted a collection of electronic-tinged pop-rock that it’s impossible not to fall for. Over the course of 15 tracks she explores some more experimental percussion and production (such as on the stuttering-then-flowing, Fiona Apple-esque ‘Cinnamon’) as well as showcasing her ear for a hook, such as on the powerful earworm ‘Dead Horse’ and the Sunday-afternoon radio ballad ‘Pure Love’. The result is an hour of consistently arresting, energising music that draws from an impressively wide emotional range.  \n\nFew would deny that the defining characteristic of Paramore as a band is Hayley Williams’s unmistakable voice. Whisper to roar, and across a truly impressive tonal range, few rock singers can match her. Unsurprisingly that is also the strength of her first solo outing, though her consistently evolving songwriting is a close second.\n\n### 4. Beach Bunny — *Honeymoon*\n\nThis record is nine tracks and 25 minutes of relentless, sunny pop-rock. It’s proof if proof was needed that throwing four kids into a rehearsal room with a couple of guitars and a drum set can still result in something life-affirming and marvellous. \n\nOpener ‘Promises’ is first light and bubbly, and then strident and anthemic; it’s followed up with the sing-along whilst you dance-along ‘Cuffing Season’, then we drop a couple of gears for the raw, earnest ‘April’. And we’re off to the races on a giddy whirlwind tour of three-chords-and-hummable-choruses pop. By the time you reach cartwheeling closer, and album high point, ‘Cloud 9’ you’re ready to do it all again. Go on, treat yourself. You can find 25 minutes. \n\nI’m a simple man, and Weezer’s self-titled debut is my seventh-favourite record of all time. I needed something this bright and uncomplicated this year, and my thanks go out to this Chicago quartet for delivering it so effectively. \n\n###  3. Taylor Swift — *folklore*\n\nLast year’s number one released this record with 24 hours’ notice back in July, and it has been a staple on my headphones ever since. A very different-sounding record to 2019’s *Lover*, working (for the most part) in a more subdued register, *folklore* is another showcase for a phenomenal songwriting talent. There are no anthemic, danceable pop explosions here, but the more muted tone and stripped back instrumentation allow for Swift’s vocals to shine, and for her lyricism to take centre stage. \n\nWhether it’s (on ‘The Last Great American Dynasty’) telling the story of Rebekah Harkness, who used to live in the home Swift now owns, or laying out the dynamics of a love triangle over the course of three songs (‘Cardigan’, ‘August’, & ‘Betty’), Swift displays a songwriting touch as light and dextrous as the voice with which she brings those songs to life. Album highlight for me (at least at present) is Swift’s duet with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon on ‘Exile’ - a lyrically exquisite heartbreaker wherein the two voices play with and against one another perfectly. \n\nFollowing the surprise release of the album, Swift also put out a combination making-of documentary / live performance on Disney+ which offered insight on how the record came to be, and how her collaboration with The National’s Aaron Dessner came to bear this fruit. It also serves as an interesting document of how an artist usually wrapped in layers of hype and marketing, found freedom in isolation to make something intimate. The record is a fascinating balance: it represents the furthest Swift has gone into telling others’ stories (fictional and otherwise), yet each song is imbued with deeply personal feeling. \n\nSwift’s work in 2020 has been, frankly, stunning - as evidenced by her having performed the unprecedented feat of securing two spots in the top six places of this list. Having stepped outside of both the aesthetic trappings and sonic bombast usually expected of pop’s reigning queen, she has made a strong case for being recognised as a generational songwriting talent. \n\n###  2. Halsey — *Manic*\n\nWhen you open your third record on a song titled with your given name (‘Ashley’) you’re making a statement: I’m here to share something; this is coming from the heart. When you close that track with a snippet of audio from *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, you’re signalling an emotional register of earnest vulnerability. Carrying off that conversation over the course of 16 pop songs is a tall order, and yet *Manic* is an unbridled success. \n\nSomeone smarter than me could probably take the musical DNA of ‘Forever … (is a long time)’ / ‘Dominic’s Interlude’ / ‘I HATE EVERYBODY’, examine it under an electron microscope, and figure out why it makes me feel the same way as sections of My Chemical Romance’s *The Black Parade* (2006). I’m not equipped to work out the reasons, I can just tell you that it happens. The first track uses piano to effect a shift from major to minor key; the second is an organ-backed, multi-tracked, 76 second opera;  the third is a series of crescendos hitting like waves on a beach. It’s a masterful seven minutes at the centre of a bewilderingly good record.\n\nOh, and then the second half of the record kicks off with the barnstorming pop-rock ‘3am’, and then the dimly lit, sultry ‘Without Me’, then the lost KT Tunstall track I didn’t know I wanted: ‘Finally // beautiful stranger’. By the time Halsey is singing an LGBT empowerment duet with Alanis Morissette you feel it’s company they should feel comfortable keeping.  \n  \nFolk, pop, indie rock, R&B, Korean rap - this record includes a lot, and some reviews read that as coming at the expense of depth. For me it all works seamlessly almost without exception, making *Manic* read like a personal, and deeply felt record, that also happens to be a pop gem.\n\n###  1. Dua Lipa — *Future Nostalgia*\n\nHere’s the other Mercury nominee, and (I have just learned) Spotify’s most played female artist of 2020. So firmly is the 2020 pop crown sat atop Dua’s head that one of her best tracks of the year isn’t even on this record, it’s over on Miley Cyrus’s *Plastic Hearts* - the high point of an album that very nearly made this list.\n\nWhilst Taylor Swift was writing folk ballads in a woodland cabin it seems Dua was channeling the attentions of the pop gods to teach a neon-soaked masterclass in funk and disco-infused bangers. This is music designed in a lab to destroy radios, dance floors, and TikTok alike. All of which would be for nothing if it wasn’t, from start to finish, an unmitigated success. You cannot fail to smile, you absolutely will nod along, sing along, and feel some of these beats in your bones.\n\nThe Pitchfork review of *Future Nostalgia* has a good line in which they say that the album ‘sounds like three Madonna eras at once’. As someone who has a huge amount of affection for pretty much all of Madonna’s eras (not you *American Life*, you can sit down) this is a recipe for success in my mind. Providing, that is, that you can walk in Madonna’s shadow – not an easy thing to do. Dua comes armed with the disco beats of peak Kylie, and a faultless ear for both a groove and a beat. The result is a remarkable pop record that samples White Town on ‘Love Again’, and channels John Deacon on ‘Break My Heart’, but also sounds entirely cohesive and possessed of limitless self-confidence. \n\nThe title track, ‘Don’t Start Now’, ‘Physical’, ‘Hallucinate’, and ‘Break My Heart’ could each be career-defining encores for a lot of artists. As it stands, I get the feeling that this is just the beginning of what Dua Lipa is capable of.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nThis is the second year that my list has been topped by a thoroughbred pop record, and there are more albums elsewhere on the list this year than ever before which fall in that category. What I find particularly interesting is that the great bulk of my music-listening year is taken up with records from all over the genre map. At the time of writing I’ve listened to 213 records released in 2020 at least once through. From ambient and drone to jazz and metal I found records this year that I really enjoyed. But when the chips are down and I have to pick the records that genuinely gave me the most pleasure, increasingly it’s pop music that I turn to. Perhaps two years in a row is a coincidence, but even if the 2021 list doesn’t end up having a pop album on top I’ll be shocked if there isn’t a handful of them in the mix. \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"title": "Naughty Dog — The Last of Us Part II (2020)",
				"content_html": "<p>As someone who genuinely loves video games, and who feels invested in what they can do and be – as well as how they&rsquo;re evolving – I feel bad about skipping <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>\n<p>I never owned a PlayStation 3, and so my initial contact with the original game was as this heralded title – a marked step forward in interactive narratives – that I couldn&rsquo;t play. I picked up the &lsquo;Remastered&rsquo; edition for PlayStation 4 around five years ago, and I&rsquo;m a little ashamed to say that I&rsquo;ve never finished it.</p>\n<p>With a handful of notable exceptions (<em>Metal Gear Solid</em> (1998); <em>Mark of the Ninja</em> (2012) etc.) stealth games have never really been precisely my cup of tea. I found that the difficulty ramp and resource scarcity in <em>The Last of Us</em> made clear that stealth was the proper way to play it, and when I messed up — frequently — I felt punished in a non-negotiable way. Encounters felt binary: successfully find the correct path along which to sneak, or otherwise expend ammunition and healing resources. If the latter, the margin of error on subsequent encounters was shrunk even thinner. As effective as I found its storytelling to be, its primary gameplay mechanics left me frustrated.</p>\n<p>Reviews for the new game are — not unexpectedly — stellar; at the time of writing it has a Metacritic score of 96% aggregated from 91 outlets. That feels about as close to a &lsquo;must play&rsquo; as you can get, and yet some reviews [<a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence\">1</a>] [<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxqnxy/last-of-us-part-2-review\">2</a>] give me pause. The game sounds absolutely unrelenting and brutal. That&rsquo;s a choice of tone that certainly fits the story it&rsquo;s telling and the world it&rsquo;s building, but which makes the experience feel ill suited to the current moment. Take this from Waypoint&rsquo;s review:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is over two dozen hours of spiraling cycles of violence and vengeance, being reminded roughly every hour that the whole endeavor is squalid and cruel.

I&rsquo;m simultaneously glad that Naughty Dog have pushed their game that far, and sure that this isn&rsquo;t a game for me. It&rsquo;s an encouraging sign of the medium&rsquo;s burgeoning maturity that there is space in video games for a AAA title to explore this emotional territory, but I find myself unwilling to take the journey right now. I know I&rsquo;ll be missing out on something special, and that by doing so I&rsquo;m placing myself on the outside of a conversation that will be ongoing for a while. There&rsquo;s certainly a pull to play the game simply <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s going to be a landmark, but I don&rsquo;t feel it strongly enough at present to invest the time or emotional labour.</p>\n<p>(That is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/R_Nikaido/status/1274142361635876866?s=20\">very impressive cable</a> though.)</p>\n",
				"content_text": "As someone who genuinely loves video games, and who feels invested in what they can do and be – as well as how they're evolving – I feel bad about skipping *The Last of Us Part II*. \n\nI never owned a PlayStation 3, and so my initial contact with the original game was as this heralded title – a marked step forward in interactive narratives – that I couldn't play. I picked up the 'Remastered' edition for PlayStation 4 around five years ago, and I'm a little ashamed to say that I've never finished it. \n\nWith a handful of notable exceptions (*Metal Gear Solid* (1998); *Mark of the Ninja* (2012) etc.) stealth games have never really been precisely my cup of tea. I found that the difficulty ramp and resource scarcity in *The Last of Us* made clear that stealth was the proper way to play it, and when I messed up — frequently — I felt punished in a non-negotiable way. Encounters felt binary: successfully find the correct path along which to sneak, or otherwise expend ammunition and healing resources. If the latter, the margin of error on subsequent encounters was shrunk even thinner. As effective as I found its storytelling to be, its primary gameplay mechanics left me frustrated.\n\nReviews for the new game are — not unexpectedly — stellar; at the time of writing it has a Metacritic score of 96% aggregated from 91 outlets. That feels about as close to a 'must play' as you can get, and yet some reviews [[1](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence)] [[2](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxqnxy/last-of-us-part-2-review)] give me pause. The game sounds absolutely unrelenting and brutal. That's a choice of tone that certainly fits the story it's telling and the world it's building, but which makes the experience feel ill suited to the current moment. Take this from Waypoint's review: \n\n> It is over two dozen hours of spiraling cycles of violence and vengeance, being reminded roughly every hour that the whole endeavor is squalid and cruel. There is hardly a moment of joy it will not eventually curdle. A truly shocking number of characters that you will come to care about will be gruesomely mutilated, or slaughtered, or both. All of it is utterly predictable, or if you’re feeling charitable, tragically fated.\n\nThat sounds like hard work. I'm simultaneously glad that Naughty Dog have pushed their game that far, and sure that this isn't a game for me.

There's certainly a pull to play the game simply *because* it's going to be a landmark, but I don't feel it strongly enough at present to invest the time or emotional labour. \n\n(That is a [very impressive cable](https://twitter.com/R_Nikaido/status/1274142361635876866?s=20) though.)\n",

First single you ever bought</h3>\n<p><strong>Whitney Houston: ‘I Will Always Love You’</strong> — I can’t swear to this being the absolute first single I bought, but it’s the first I <em>remember</em> buying. It would have been during the song’s 23-week run on the UK chart between November 1992 and April 1993, and I distinctly recall that my two purchases from the Hereford branch of Our Price that day were this single, and the <em>Love Symbol</em> album by Prince &amp; the New Power Generation.</p>\n<p>This is obviously a flawless vocal performance by Houston, of whom my dad was a fan but to whom I paid too little attention into my 30s. (Both <em>Whitney Houston</em> (1985) and <em>Whitney</em> (1987) recently warranted re-listens when assessing my favourite records of the 1980s.)</p>\n<p>Ironically: I prefer the Dolly Parton original of this song these days.<br>\nDouble ironically: I’ve never seen <em>The Bodyguard</em>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-the-first-gig-you-ever-went-to\">2. The first gig you ever went to</h3>\n<p><strong>M People: ‘Don’t Look Any Further’</strong> — St David’s Hall, Cardiff. 1994? ‘Moving On Up’ and ‘Search for the Hero’ had the radio ubiquity, but whenever my dad would play the album, it was this song that captured my imagination. It is, as they say, still a bop.</p>\n<p>In keeping with the previous track, my preference these days is for the Dennis Edwards original principally because of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E7t8eoA_1jQ\">its bassline</a>, and in spite of its <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CH3rx8LhrQo\">mind-bendingly bad music video</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-one-or-both-of-your-parents\">3. A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents</h3>\n<p><strong>The Carpenters: ‘Top of the World’</strong> — I may not have agreed to this if I’d known it would lead to floods of tears. I haven’t played this since my mum’s funeral, and I will never not think of her when I hear anything by The Carpenters. On a related note, this is why art is so very important: it provides intangible, permanent connection to things that we’ve otherwise lost, and a means through which to feel and express things we otherwise aren’t sure how to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-a-teenage-crush\">4. A song that reminds you of a teenage crush</h3>\n<p><strong>Portishead: ‘Glory Box’</strong> — my first relationship that lasted more than a couple of months was with a very sweet, tomboyish girl. A few of our friendship group were very into Portishead’s first record, but I remember distinctly that she connected deeply with this particular song. Somehow it made more sense to me after she broke our relationship off, and began seeing a girl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-your-partner\">5. A song that reminds you of your partner</h3>\n<p><strong>The White Stripes: ‘The Air Near My Fingers’</strong> — My partner recently estimated that I spend 70% of my time thinking about food, and the rest thinking about her. Those percentages are wrong, but the sentiment isn’t. As such I don’t really need <em>reminding</em> of her, but here’s the song I associate most acutely with our early relationship. <em>Elephant</em> was the record that soundtracked a lot of what you might call our courtship, and this song in particular – with its refrain: “I get nervous when she comes around” – is 100% tied up with what it felt like getting to know her, and falling in love with her.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-a-song-that-you-wish-you-could-play-on-guitar\">6. A song that you wish you could play on guitar</h3>\n<p><strong>Prince’s contribution to ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ from the 2004 Rock Hall of Fame induction ceremony</strong> — I can’t play any songs on guitar, so I’m shooting for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y\">the heavens</a> on the understanding that if I could play this, I could play anything else I darn well pleased. I honestly can’t think of another single piece of guitar playing that is this transcendent. If I dedicated the rest of my life solely to learning this one guitar part I honestly don’t think I would ever get there. And even if I did, I still wouldn’t be able to <a href=\"https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/tom-petty-and-others-tell-the-story-behind-princes-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-solo\">make guitars magically disappear</a> into thin air.</p>\n<p>Side note: my second choice is Prince’s performance of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7NN3gsSf-Ys\">‘Purple Rain’</a> at the 2007 Super Bowl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-a-song-that-you-hope-never-to-hear-again\">7. A song that you hope never to hear again</h3>\n<p><strong>Foghat: ‘Slow Ride’</strong> — Firstly, this isn’t a good song. It’s a bad song. But there are other bad songs of its calibre: ‘House of the Rising Sun’, ‘The Girl from Ipanema’, and ‘Hotel California’ could all disappear from the Earth today and I’d be quite happy never to hear them ever again. I’m choosing the Foghat track for one specific reason: I must have listened to it upwards of 100 times, sometimes ~20 times in a row, whilst trying to 5-star it on <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em> (which I never did). The song sucks. Please erase it from existence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-a-guilty-pleasure\">8. A guilty pleasure</h3>\n<p>This is the first tough one; I don’t really feel any guilt about taking pleasure in art. I’ll tell anyone who will listen that Madonna’s ‘Borderline’ (<em>Immaculate Collection</em> Remix (1990)) is my favourite song. Would you like to hear about why Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Cut to the Feeling’ is a masterpiece? Do you want to discuss how Meatloaf’s 12 minute rock opera classic ‘I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)’ is, if anything, too short?</p>\n<p>Honestly, I feel more reticence naming My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> as my favourite album because it carries all sorts of connotations with which I don’t entirely associate. But do I feel guilty? No your honour, I do not.</p>\n<p>So here’s the best I’ve got: <strong>Michael Jackson: ‘Leave Me Alone’</strong> — my favourite song by an artist I adored in the formative years of my music listening, and defended vociferously in the midst of allegations against him in the mid 90s. The music is still very special to me today, but that relationship is — obviously — more complicated now, and I’m not as firmly in the habit of loudly proclaiming my love of Michael Jackson as I once was.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-the-opposite-of-a-guilty-pleasure-ie-an-artistsong-you-didnt-like-but-pretended-to-like-to-look-cool\">9. The opposite of a guilty pleasure (i.e., an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)</h3>\n<p>I’m glad this is framed in the past tense, because (as above) I’m not someone who feels any guilt about the art they do or don’t like. That wasn’t always the case, however!</p>\n<p>In the mid-to-late 90s I had a circle of friends that were primarily into metal. I certainly loved a good number of bands under that label (Metallica, Sepultura, Korn et al) but for the most part my tastes paddled out of the shallow end to only chest-deep water. I was the grunge kid of the group really, but despite that being evidenced by my wearing petticoats and tights to club nights, for some reason I felt the need to at least pretend that I was on board with whatever the others were listening to. When you’re a skinny fifteen year old wearing a woman’s undergarment and mascara, and a six foot guy in all black leather is smoking directly into your face and telling you Cradle of Filth are the best band in the world, sometimes you bite your tongue and nod. So, here you go, enjoy: <strong>Cradle of Filth: ‘Forest Whispers My Name’</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-a-song-youre-currently-listening-to\">10. A song you&rsquo;re currently listening to</h3>\n<p>Oh shoot, so many options. Plus I feel an obligation to try and rescue this (very uneven) playlist from the clutches of Dani Filth. Let’s keep it simple: my favourite song from 2020 at the time of writing. Kill ‘em Selena: <strong>Selena Gomez: ‘Dance Again’</strong></p>\n",

				"title": "20 Favourite Films",
				"content_html": "<p>As visitors to this site may know, my friend James and I have a ritual of exchanging &lsquo;Top 20&rsquo; lists of our favourite albums at the end of each year. (All of those can be found <a href=\"/thelists\">here</a>.) Since this year marks the <em>twentieth</em> anniversary of that tradition, we decided to branch out a little and add in some additional mid-year lists. So here&rsquo;s the first of two, listing my favourite 20 films.</p>\n<p>This is the result of a lot of brainstorming, shortlisting, and hand-wringing. This list is firmly timestamped <strong>20 June 2020</strong>; positions are mutable, and there are 100 movies tied for the number 21 spot, any one of which could sneak on here on the right day.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I approached this as a fan of <em>Drive</em> (2011) and someone who pulled a confused face through most of <em>Only God Forgives</em> (2013). Happily <em>The Neon Demon</em> took me on a ride that I won&rsquo;t soon forget. Alongside one other (in some respects curiously similar) film, this is the closest I get to horror on this list, but I have a hard time thinking of it that way.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This is a perfect example of a small, personal movie that transcends niche subject matter to feel universal. (See also <em>Rocky</em>). I could watch this 100 times just for JK Simmons&rsquo;s performance – one of the most compelling characters of modern cinema.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Famously this was a higher budget project with (even) more high profile stars attached, and then it fell apart. I cannot for the life of me imagine a version of this movie without these central performances, or the settings exactly as they are.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t Aronofsky&rsquo;s only appearance on this list, and with the notable exception of <em>Noah</em> (2014) he&rsquo;s possibly the director I feel most in tune with.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There&rsquo;s not much left to be said about <em>Rocky</em>. Even today it feels like lightning in a bottle.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The peaks of cinematic style over the last 30 years feature <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (1994), <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), and this film. Pitch perfect soundtrack, understated performances, beautiful camerawork, one of the best opening sequences ever. Re-watch it, I virtually guarantee it&rsquo;s even better than you remember.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Maybe, just maybe, the best central performance of my lifetime, and that&rsquo;s just one component of a masterful film. I find a new shot to marvel at on each re-watch, and Jonny Greenwood&rsquo;s score is jaw dropping all by itself.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Flash back to 8 year old Adam for whom his stuffed Roger Rabbit and the cardboard Benny the Cab in which it arrived were prized possessions. This is a magical movie entirely in love with movie magic at every level, and it remains an absolute pleasure.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I saw this on my 30th birthday at Curzon Soho and it absolutely stunned me. I was already an avowed Aronofsky fan by that point, but this film – which I read as an urgent female revision of <em>Fight Club</em> (1999) – locked him in as the most vital of working directors. (I wrote a review <a href=\"/blackswan\">here</a>.)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As with many people, one of the most formative films of my youth. I just about wore out the taped-from-TV copy that had an almost permanent home in our top-loading Betamax. Eventually this would lead me to Spielberg, then Coppola, then everything else!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>By the time I saw this I knew <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> inside out and back to front, and I was still blown away by the music of Tarantino&rsquo;s script. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the film&rsquo;s cultural impact, since it&rsquo;s now woven into the fabric of much that followed. For me too it remains a touchstone film that also happens to be a darn good time.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>An audacious masterpiece featuring a career best performance from Keaton, surrounded by other brilliant performances by Norton, Stone et al. It&rsquo;s smart, dark, funny, and the score is a part of the picture in a way I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt before. You could entirely lose the &lsquo;no cuts&rsquo; device and still have a wonderful film. As it stands it&rsquo;s also a profound piece of art about authenticity and performance.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We can argue about whether it&rsquo;s one film or two, but Tarantino&rsquo;s on my side so I&rsquo;ll win. This is the best picture by one of the most vital, inventive directors in cinema history. That it comes in the form of a funny, beautifully shot, blood-soaked martial arts epic is just a bonus to my way of thinking. No one has made a movie like this since; my fingers ache from having been crossed for so long at the prospect of the long-rumoured third instalment.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone was really ready for <em>The Matrix</em>, but I certainly wasn&rsquo;t. When it came out I was preoccupied checking the (janky, infant) web for anything I could learn about <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. Later that year, in what felt like the space of a week, I&rsquo;d have my mind blown by <em>Fight Club</em>, and my nerves shredded by <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. But it&rsquo;s <em>The Matrix</em> that changed everything. Its impact on wider culture is astounding, let alone what it did to action films, and it remains timelessly cool and perfectly structured to this day - honestly I don&rsquo;t think a movie has been released since that balances style and substance this well.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the most transcendent cinema-going experiences of my life. An unalloyed joy from beginning to end, with one of the most charming central performances imaginable. It&rsquo;s about growing up too slowly and falling behind and not fitting in and feeling completely adrift, and trying to make peace with it. Despite all the ways I&rsquo;m different to Frances, I&rsquo;ve rarely felt so seen in (or reassured by) a piece of art.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t born when <em>Close Encounters&hellip;</em> came out, and I was only an infant when <em>ET</em> was released. This was my Spielberg movie, and my first summer blockbuster. The first film for which I pored over every magazine article, collected stickers, bought the &lsquo;making of&rsquo; and &lsquo;art of&rsquo; books. It remains an example of perfectly crafted, immaculate cinema.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I enjoy a jump-scare-filled slasher movie as much as the next person, but nothing comes close to this for me in terms of inducing sheer dread.

				"content_text": "As visitors to this site may know, my friend James and I have a ritual of exchanging 'Top 20' lists of our favourite albums at the end of each year. (All of those can be found [here](/thelists).) Since this year marks the *twentieth* anniversary of that tradition, we decided to branch out a little and add in some additional mid-year lists. So here's the first of two, listing my favourite 20 films. \n\nThis is the result of a lot of brainstorming, shortlisting, and hand-wringing. This list is firmly timestamped **20 June 2020**; positions are mutable, and there are 100 movies tied for the number 21 spot, any one of which could sneak on here on the right day.\n\n<h3>20. The Neon Demon (2016)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Nicolas Winding Refn</span></h3>\n\nI approached this as a fan of *Drive* (2011) and someone who pulled a confused face through most of *Only God Forgives* (2013). Happily *The Neon Demon* took me on a ride that I won't soon forget. Alongside one other (in some respects curiously similar) film, this is the closest I get to horror on this list, but I have a hard time thinking of it that way. \n\n<h3>19. Whiplash (2014)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Damien Chazelle</span></h3>\n\nThis is a perfect example of a small, personal movie that transcends niche subject matter to feel universal. (See also *Rocky*). I could watch this 100 times just for JK Simmons's performance – one of the most compelling characters of modern cinema. \n\n<h3>18. The Fountain (2006)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Darren Aronofsky</span></h3>\n\nFamously this was a higher budget project with (even) more high profile stars attached, and then it fell apart. I cannot for the life of me imagine a version of this movie without these central performances, or the settings exactly as they are. \n\nThis isn't Aronofsky's only appearance on this list, and with the notable exception of *Noah* (2014) he's possibly the director I feel most in tune with.\n\n<h3>17. Rocky (1976)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. John G. Avildsen</span></h3>\n\nThere's not much left to be said about *Rocky*. Even today it feels like lightning in a bottle.\n\n<h3>16. Drive (2011)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Nicolas Winding Refn</span></h3>\n\nThe peaks of cinematic style over the last 30 years feature *Pulp Fiction* (1994), *The Matrix* (1999), and this film. Pitch perfect soundtrack, understated performances, beautiful camerawork, one of the best opening sequences ever. Re-watch it, I virtually guarantee it's even better than you remember.\n\n<h3>15. There Will Be Blood (2007)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Paul Thomas Anderson</span></h3>\n\nMaybe, just maybe, the best central performance of my lifetime, and that's just one component of a masterful film. I find a new shot to marvel at on each re-watch, and Jonny Greenwood's score is jaw dropping all by itself.\n\n<h3>14. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Robert Zemeckis</span></h3>\n\nFlash back to 8 year old Adam for whom his stuffed Roger Rabbit and the cardboard Benny the Cab in which it arrived were prized possessions. This is a magical movie entirely in love with movie magic at every level, and it remains an absolute pleasure.\n\n<h3>13. Black Swan (2010)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Darren Aronofsky</span></h3>\n\nI saw this on my 30th birthday at Curzon Soho and it absolutely stunned me. I was already an avowed Aronofsky fan by that point, but this film – which I read as an urgent female revision of *Fight Club* (1999) – locked him in as the most vital of working directors. (I wrote a review [here](/blackswan).)\n\n<h3>12. Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope (1977)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. George Lucas</span></h3>\n\nAs with many people, one of the most formative films of my youth. I just about wore out the taped-from-TV copy that had an almost permanent home in our top-loading Betamax. Eventually this would lead me to Spielberg, then Coppola, then everything else!\n\n<h3>11. Pulp Fiction (1994)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Quentin Tarantino</span></h3>\n\nBy the time I saw this I knew *Reservoir Dogs* inside out and back to front, and I was still blown away by the music of Tarantino's script. It's hard to overstate the film's cultural impact, since it's now woven into the fabric of much that followed. For me too it remains a touchstone film that also happens to be a darn good time.\n\n\n<h3>10. Birdman (2014)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Alejandro G. Iñárritu</span></h3>\n\nAn audacious masterpiece featuring a career best performance from Keaton, surrounded by other brilliant performances by Norton, Stone et al. It's smart, dark, funny, and the score is a part of the picture in a way I don't think I've felt before. You could entirely lose the 'no cuts' device and still have a wonderful film. As it stands it's also a profound piece of art about authenticity and performance.\n\n<h3>9. Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair (2011)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Quentin Tarantino</span></h3>\n\nWe can argue about whether it's one film or two, but Tarantino's on my side so I'll win. This is the best picture by one of the most vital, inventive directors in cinema history. That it comes in the form of a funny, beautifully shot, blood-soaked martial arts epic is just a bonus to my way of thinking. No one has made a movie like this since; my fingers ache from having been crossed for so long at the prospect of the long-rumoured third instalment. \n\n<h3>8. The Matrix (1999)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. The Wachowskis</span></h3>\n\nI don't think anyone was really ready for *The Matrix*, but I certainly wasn't. When it came out I was preoccupied checking the (janky, infant) web for anything I could learn about *The Phantom Menace*. Later that year, in what felt like the space of a week, I'd have my mind blown by *Fight Club*, and my nerves shredded by *The Blair Witch Project*. But it's *The Matrix* that changed everything. Its impact on wider culture is astounding, let alone what it did to action films, and it remains timelessly cool and perfectly structured to this day - honestly I don't think a movie has been released since that balances style and substance this well.\n\n<h3>7. Frances Ha (2012)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Noah Baumbach</span></h3>\n\nOne of the most transcendent cinema-going experiences of my life. An unalloyed joy from beginning to end, with one of the most charming central performances imaginable. It's about growing up too slowly and falling behind and not fitting in and feeling completely adrift, and trying to make peace with it. Despite all the ways I'm different to Frances, I've rarely felt so seen in (or reassured by) a piece of art. \n\n\n<h3>6. Jurassic Park (1993)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Steven Spielberg</span></h3>\n\nI wasn't born when *Close Encounters...* came out, and I was only an infant when *ET* was released. This was my Spielberg movie, and my first summer blockbuster. The first film for which I pored over every magazine article, collected stickers, bought the 'making of' and 'art of' books. It remains an example of perfectly crafted, immaculate cinema.\n\n<h3>5. mother! (2017)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Darren Aronofsky</span></h3>\n\nI enjoy a jump-scare-filled slasher movie as much as the next person, but nothing comes close to this for me in terms of inducing sheer dread. A masterpiece of mood setting and audience manipulation, with an unbelievable career-best central performance from Jennifer Lawrence. Aronofsky's use of his set — the way the house changes throughout — is spellbinding, and his pacing is superb. And the sheer audacity to go as far as this film goes is stunning. The most potent metaphor for the creative process imaginable.\n\n<h3>4. Groundhog Day (1993)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Harold Ramis</span></h3>\n\nI re-watch this every 2 February as though it were a religious holiday. Tonally flawless, with a Bill Murray performance for the ages. It does a remarkable job of getting to the human centre of its high concept premise. Ironically it remains endlessly re-watchable.\n\n\n<h3>3. The Big Lebowski (1998)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Joel Coen</span></h3>\n\nThe best comedy ever made. Flawless script, flawless performances, and a sense of the world that is entirely its own. There are weirder Coens' movies; there are probably more inventive Coens' movies, but this is the one they will almost certainly never top. If I could only take one movie to a desert island, this might be it.\n\n<h3>2. Back to the Future (1985)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Robert Zemeckis</span></h3>\n\nTake a sci-fi concept, sprinkle in Greek myth, add Huey Lewis and the News... you're part way to making a flawless masterpiece of family cinema. Whether it's Zemeckis & Bob Gale's script; Fox, Lloyd, and Thompson's performances; the soundtrack; the visual design, or (most likely) a combination of all those elements, the film is imbued with an undiminished warmth. (The recent ['Reunited Apart' episode](https://youtu.be/crdYIUdUOhc) with the cast and crew is the best thing to come out of COVID-19 lockdown.)\n\n<h3>1. Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Irvin Kershner</span></h3>\n\nFor me personally this is the most awe & wonder per foot of celluloid I've ever encountered. AT-ATs; Yoda; the cave; \"I love you\" / \"I know\"; the duel on Cloud City; \"Luke, I am your father\".... Absolutely unbeatable.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIt's only right for me to point out that I'm aware this list is overwhelmingly populated by white men; in fact the Wachowskis & Alejandro González Iñárritu are the only people here that fall outside of that category.

				"title": "Jenny Offill — Weather (2020)",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/f65a97cf84.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I spent Sunday afternoon between the armchair and the sofa, reading Jenny Offill&rsquo;s latest novel: <em>Weather</em>. Her previous – <em>Dept. of Speculation</em> (2014) – was a novel I picked up in a book shop because of its cover, and purchased immediately upon reading its first three sentences:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Antelopes have 10x vision, you said. It was the beginning or close to it. That means that on a clear night they can see the rings of Saturn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was thrilled by something on almost every page of that novel. Offill&rsquo;s writing is concise and incisive, articulating the ideas and questions of her narrators clearly and without judgment. I had been looking forward to her next novel ever since, and <em>Weather</em> had sat on the shelf since release in February, waiting for a day like this when I would be able to enjoy it in its entirety.

				"content_text": "![](/uploads/2023/f65a97cf84.png)\n\nI spent Sunday afternoon between the armchair and the sofa, reading Jenny Offill's latest novel: *Weather*. Her previous – *Dept. of Speculation* (2014) – was a novel I picked up in a book shop because of its cover, and purchased immediately upon reading its first three sentences:\n\n> Antelopes have 10x vision, you said. It was the beginning or close to it. That means that on a clear night they can see the rings of Saturn. \n\nI was thrilled by something on almost every page of that novel. Offill's writing is concise and incisive, articulating the ideas and questions of her narrators clearly and without judgment. I had been looking forward to her next novel ever since, and *Weather* had sat on the shelf since release in February, waiting for a day like this when I would be able to enjoy it in its entirety.

				"title": "Doctor(s) Sleep",
				"content_html": "<p>Over the weekend I finished reading Stephen King’s 2013 novel <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, and then caught up with the film adaptation from 2019. Here are some (relatively spoiler free) thoughts in bullet form.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s brave to return to material this well regarded.</strong> <em>The Shining</em> (1977) remains one of the top-tier novels of King’s long career, which makes <em>Doctor Sleep</em> a huge gamble. The stakes are far higher here than for any one of the (very few) other direct sequels he’s written, such as continuations of the Bill Hodges story, or <em>Black House</em> (2001, alongside Peter Straub).</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a very different novel to its precursor.</strong> I haven’t looked too deep into it, but I gather the backlash to <em>Doctor Sleep</em> on publication was that it wasn’t <em>The Shining</em>. And it sure isn’t. King’s not interested in retreading old ground, and he flips the claustrophobia, the isolation, and even the power dynamics of his decades-old classic on their heads for the sequel. There are familiar thematic elements – such as addiction as metaphor for possession – but those too are inverted: Danny isn’t his father, and the novel’s villains have as much to lose as its protagonists do.</p>\n<p><strong>You can’t ride two horses at the same time.</strong> I don’t envy Mike Flanagan the task of adapting this book for film. Readers of <em>The Shining</em> who have also seen Kubrick’s 1980 film will know that there are significant plot differences; in particular the two versions have very different endings. Flanagan takes on the task of both bringing the new book to screen, and producing a sequel to Kubrick’s film – and you simply can’t do both. He sure tries, but the last act of the movie indulges in exactly the sort of heavy-handed nostalgia that King avoids in the novel. Flanagan is aware that a majority of his audience will know the cinematic version of <em>The Shining</em> better than they know the source work, and he plays to it with mixed results.</p>\n<p><strong>The medium shapes the story in interesting ways.</strong> As a huge fan of Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> (another 2013 novel), I had high hopes for what turned out to be a serviceable but uninspired film adaptation of that book. Watching the movie version was a lesson in all the many things that can be done on the page that just can’t be translated to film. I found the same thing at play with <em>Doctor Sleep</em>. At 150+ minutes it’s not short, and yet it’s far <em>too</em> short to get to know its cast of characters anything like as well as one does when reading the novel. I suppose that’s par for the course; a book will always be better than the film of it, at least in most respects. I was struck in particular by one effect that the streamlining for screen had on the story here.

				"content_text": "Over the weekend I finished reading Stephen King’s 2013 novel *Doctor Sleep*, and then caught up with the film adaptation from 2019. Here are some (relatively spoiler free) thoughts in bullet form. \n\n**It’s brave to return to material this well regarded.** *The Shining* (1977) remains one of the top-tier novels of King’s long career, which makes *Doctor Sleep* a huge gamble. The stakes are far higher here than for any one of the (very few) other direct sequels he’s written, such as continuations of the Bill Hodges story, or *Black House* (2001, alongside Peter Straub). \n\n**It’s a very different novel to its precursor.** I haven’t looked too deep into it, but I gather the backlash to *Doctor Sleep* on publication was that it wasn’t *The Shining*. And it sure isn’t. King’s not interested in retreading old ground, and he flips the claustrophobia, the isolation, and even the power dynamics of his decades-old classic on their heads for the sequel. There are familiar thematic elements – such as addiction as metaphor for possession – but those too are inverted: Danny isn’t his father, and the novel’s villains have as much to lose as its protagonists do. \n\n**You can’t ride two horses at the same time.** I don’t envy Mike Flanagan the task of adapting this book for film. Readers of *The Shining* who have also seen Kubrick’s 1980 film will know that there are significant plot differences; in particular the two versions have very different endings. Flanagan takes on the task of both bringing the new book to screen, and producing a sequel to Kubrick’s film – and you simply can’t do both. He sure tries, but the last act of the movie indulges in exactly the sort of heavy-handed nostalgia that King avoids in the novel. Flanagan is aware that a majority of his audience will know the cinematic version of *The Shining* better than they know the source work, and he plays to it with mixed results. \n\n**The medium shapes the story in interesting ways.** As a huge fan of Donna Tartt’s *The Goldfinch* (another 2013 novel), I had high hopes for what turned out to be a serviceable but uninspired film adaptation of that book. Watching the movie version was a lesson in all the many things that can be done on the page that just can’t be translated to film. I found the same thing at play with *Doctor Sleep*. At 150+ minutes it’s not short, and yet it’s far *too* short to get to know its cast of characters anything like as well as one does when reading the novel. I suppose that’s par for the course; a book will always be better than the film of it, at least in most respects. I was struck in particular by one effect that the streamlining for screen had on the story here. The result is a work that’s strangely cruel to some of its characters: there are no fewer than three protagonists that make it the end of the novel just fine, but who meet (sometimes gruesome) ends on screen. These are characters who certainly don’t need to die, except that it would complicate the film to have them hanging around. \n\n**King’s ending is better.** As might be clear by now, I much preferred the novel to the film. (The latter isn’t bad, and I can see myself watching and enjoying it again in a few years’ time; perhaps when the novel is less fresh to me, I’ll be able to come to Flanagan’s movie on its own terms.)

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-caterina-barbieri--ecstatic-computation\">20. Caterina Barbieri — <em>Ecstatic Computation</em></h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://caterinabarbieri.com\">her (neo-GeoCities) website</a>, Barbieri ‘explores the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations in music, by investigating the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers to draw severe, complex geometries in time and space’. That’s a better explanation than I can offer as to how her music operates. Often sparse it still has the ability to surprise through the unexpected ways in which the rhythms play around and off each other. The 10-plus minutes of opener ‘Fantas’ is a sonic world all its own; dark echoes give birth to bright synths, which in turn make way for mellower, fuzzier tones. It’s a headphone album right down to its sonic DNA, and when I made time to listen to it that way I enjoyed it enormously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-chai--punk\">19. CHAI — <em>Punk</em></h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Nisennenmondai infiltrated the ranks of Go! Team, I have your answer. CHAI is an all-female Japanese pop-rock ensemble who make one heck of a racket. I have very little idea what’s going on in most of these tracks – the lyrics are a mix of Japanese and heavily-accented English – but it never matters. Killer bass lines conspire with super-catchy synths and a combination of live and programmed drums to make the kind of 32 minute record that leaves you desperate to find out what this all looks and sounds like live. It’s dayglo bright and not at all nuanced, and the weirdness of understanding only every fifth lyric never really goes away, but joy and enthusiasm just radiates from it in waves. And in 2019, there’s nothing more punk than that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-thom-yorke--anima\">18. Thom Yorke — <em>ANIMA</em></h3>\n<p>Perhaps it’s misleading, but increasingly it feels possible to discern what each member of Radiohead brings to their collaborative project by examining their solo output. Ed O’Brien’s recent single ‘Brasil’ starts out folksy and grounded, before being lifted (by Colin Greenwood’s bass no less) into a different place: somewhere looser, groovier, and more danceable. Jony Greenwood’s film scores have given a glimpse of the expanse and complexity of his musical thinking. And Thom Yorke keeps making weird, dark electronica records.</p>\n<p><em>ANIMA</em> feels even more insular to me than previous releases, trapped in its own head, or else providing a release for someone who otherwise would be. It’s still seductive, and beautifully crafted, but despite knowing I was holding its composer to a higher standard, I couldn’t help but note the lack of an ‘Analyse’, ‘Harrowdown Hill’, or ‘A Brain in a Bottle’ here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-charly-bliss--young-enough\">17. Charly Bliss — <em>Young Enough</em></h3>\n<p>You might remember Charly Bliss’s debut (<em>Guppy</em>) from my 2017 list, or the highlight of the album, ‘Ruby’, as one of my songs of that year. Their follow up is more of the same: bubblegum-adjacent melodies and an arch vocal delivery of largely diaristic lyrics. It’s fun stuff, and catchy in a lot of the right places. The playing has tightened up a little bit, and it feels as though a decision has been taken to polish the production a bit more than previously. There are still loose ends and plenty of energy, but it doesn’t feel as raw as before. Even so, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of a second helping of Charly Bliss. One listen through opener ‘Blown to Bits’ will tell you whether it might also be your thing. (PS. That track opens with a synth chord so close to the one that opens Weezer’s 1996 b-side ‘I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams’ that I refuse to believe it’s coincidence.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-anderson-paak--ventura\">16. Anderson .Paak — <em>Ventura</em></h3>\n<p>Anderson .Paak is an artist I’ve struggled to get a handle on. But, after dipping into 2016’s <em>Yes Lawd!</em>, and (unwittingly) skipping 2018’s <em>Oxnard</em>, I immediately vibed with the latter’s sister album: <em>Ventura</em>.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Come Home’ is like an extended title sequence, featuring some gold standard Andre 3000 bars. Then it’s on to the soulful relationship therapy of ‘Make it Better’, pairing Anderson’s rich vocals with those of none other than Smokey Robinson. From there its warm, honey-toned production, smart lyrics, and laid back beats all the way, through lead single ‘King James’ all the way until ‘What Can We Do?’ closes the record with the best Nate Dogg feature since ’21 Questions’ (2002).</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-beirut--gallipoli\">15. Beirut — <em>Gallipoli</em></h3>\n<p>Beirut is one of those bands that have long been on the periphery of my awareness, and which I knew I should be paying more attention to. Now, as with Spoon’s <em>They Want My Soul</em> (2014) and Low’s <em>Double Negative</em> (2018), a record has finally captured my full attention. Gallipoli is manifestly the work of creators very comfortable in their artistic skins. Lyrically and tonally melancholy, but musically expansive and exploratory, there’s a warmth at its heart that never dims even in its darker moments. Album high point ‘Gauze für Zah’ is an exemplar of the record’s broad sonic palate, Zach Condon’s drifting, melodic vocal, and the manner in which Beirut are often content to let compositions develop at an unforced pace rather than force a strict structure.</p>\n<p>This won’t be for everyone, but it was a record unlike many others I heard this year, and I was grateful to it for bringing Beirut more squarely into focus for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-james-blake--assume-form\">14. James Blake — <em>Assume Form</em></h3>\n<p>This album came along so early in the year (18 Jan) that I wasn’t sure it would stick around for me, but I’ve played it fairly regularly all year. I know a lot of people call out Blake’s voice as a highlight of his work; I find it very effective (particularly in its higher register), but I would also take an album full of his giddy, kaleidoscopic sonic compositions without the vocals. In fact, the better vocal performances on this record belong to Travis Scott on album highlight ‘Mile High’, and ROSALÍA on the haunting, off-kilter ‘Barefoot in the Park’.</p>\n<p>The tempo remains staid throughout, but there’s a range of modes here, between which Blake switches without missing a beat. I find him to be an intriguing musician, and one I can’t quite place comfortably. Somewhere on an archipelago off the coast of electronica, he’s just doing his own thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-foals--part-1-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost\">13. Foals — <em>Part 1 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost</em></h3>\n<p>I had Foals’ debut, <em>Antidotes</em>, on release in 2008 and I was ready to file them away with other art-math-rock bands like Klaxons, whose debut (<em>Myths of the Near Future</em>) I had admired but not loved the year before. It’s been a welcome surprise to watch Foals grow, and their sonic palate complicate and evolve to something that I can only describe as Biffy Clyro covering The Mars Volta. <em>What Went Down</em> (2015) very nearly made my top 20 of that year, largely on the strength of its unassailably huge title track, and now we’re here.</p>\n<p>Double albums are always enormously ambitious projects, and by virtue of the two halves having been released separately I have to consider them individually. You won’t find Part 2 of <em>ENSWBL</em> on this list: its late-October release date hasn’t allowed me time to digest it enough. Part 1 has remained on heavy rotation since March, however, and despite that I feel like there’s still plenty more in there for me to discover.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-tyler-the-creator--igor\">12. Tyler, The Creator — <em>IGOR</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not sure where to start with this record. The palate is hip-hop infused with jazz touches, soul, gospel, and funk. The record opens with an extended synth tone that keys you to the texture of what follows, but what follows is a shifting thing. First track proper, ‘EARFQUAKE’ was originally written for (but rejected by) Justin Bieber, so Tyler has turned it into a downbeat pean that has shrugged itself free of anything like traditional song structure. And once you’re on the ride, you have little choice but to strap in and enjoy it; this is an album in the proper sense of the word - obviously intended to be experienced as a whole. A moody melange of twilight production, treated vocals that see Tyler pushing his singing voice as much as he raps, songs that ‘end’ and then continue… twice.</p>\n<p>Above all else it’s the sheer inventiveness of the song structures, and the compelling production that kept me coming back. I didn’t hear a finer hip-hop record this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-wand--laughing-matter\">11. Wand — <em>Laughing Matter</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve long wondered, sometimes aloud, why no one else makes music that sounds anything like Radiohead. My first impression upon hearing <em>Laughing Matter</em> was that Wand are also at least at the same dance, even if they’re moving a bit differently to the Oxford quintet.</p>\n<p>Cory Hanson’s soft, tuneful vocals; Lee Landey’s inquisitive bass lines; Evan Burrows’s restless, inventive percussion… it all adds up to something very impressive. Add in Robert Cody’s brilliantly judged guitar - always happy to play a supporting role that makes each track better - and Sofie Arreguin’s synths adding colour and sonic texture, and you have an album that blooms into something genuinely special.</p>\n<p>Aside from the, admittedly terrible, none-more-psych-rock album cover, the only disappointment is that the track ‘High Planes Drifter’ isn’t a cover of the 1989 Beastie Boys cut.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-the-regrettes--how-do-you-love\">10. The Regrettes — <em>How Do You Love?</em></h3>\n<p>I just looked back at my list from 2017 and apparently The Regrettes’ debut (<em>Feel Your Feelings Fool</em>) didn’t make the final cut. That surprised me, because in retrospect it’s one of the albums from that year that has had the most staying power for me. And now I have this excellent follow-up to file right alongside it.</p>\n<p>At heart the record is nothing more complicated than a set of relationship songs (from love songs, to break up songs and everything in between), all laid out in frontwoman Lydia Night’s smoky, bluesy vocal, underpinned by soulful bass lines and bright percussion. With the sound having evolved a hair away from the debut’s punk notes the guitar is a little bit pop and a little bit classic 50s rock n’ roll. I fully expect to be playing album highlights ‘California Friends’, ‘ I Dare You’ and ‘Pumpkin’ for years to come.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-floating-points-crush\">9. Floating Points — <em>Crush</em></h3>\n<p>My only other touchstone for the term ‘floating points’ is a measurement of computing power: FLOPS, or floating point operations per second. And to me it feels as though there’s something apt about the name chosen by neuroscientist &amp; epigeneticist Sam Shepherd for his musical project. Intricate, busy beats vie with dense, shifting loops for the listener’s attention; the listening experience is akin to visiting a gallery of impressionist visual art - sometimes bewildering, at points confrontational, but constantly intriguing and compelling.</p>\n<p>There are more easygoing moments, such as ‘Anasickmodular’ with its house beat buried deep in the mix under layers of shifting sonic sands. And there are danceable moments like ‘LesAlpx’ with its room-sized bass. It’s a record that ends up feeling far more than the sum of its parts, and one I’ll likely sit down with again and again when I have a good pair of headphones to hand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-fennesz--agora\">8. Fennesz — <em>Agora</em></h3>\n<p>It was an odd year for me and electronic / ambient music. I heard a lot of stuff I liked, but nothing quite hit me in the way LPs by Nicolas Jaar, Takeleave, Shigeto, Loscil, and Submerse etc. have in years past. Agora is the highest placing such album on this year’s list, and the closest thing I encountered to an experience like some of those listed above.</p>\n<p>Agora is actually more toward the ambient end of the spectrum. Really what you’re getting here is a quartet of what I’ve spoken of in the past as aural landscapes. This kind of sonic topography has only grown in appeal for me over the years, and Fennesz is working in the same mould as Ryuichi Sakamoto and William Basinski. When I took the time to spend with it properly, I loved it. At other times it acted as slightly odd background music to several meals.</p>\n<p>My end of year Music Replay lists Four Tet amongst my most played artists of 2019, and his studio output this year was a pair of singles. Which is to say that, unable to find truly stellar new electronica, I fell back on old favourites. Fennesz, at least, gave me something new and substantial to immerse myself in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-vampire-weekend--father-of-the-bride\">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Father of the Bride</em></h3>\n<p>Without necessarily knowing it, I’ve been waiting for this record for six years. I don’t have a copy of my lists as far back as Vampire Weekend’s eponymous 2008 debut, but I’m guessing it placed high. That album – featuring the perennial modern classics ‘A-Punk’, ‘Oxford Comma’ et al – was the most effortlessly cool arrival on the musical stage since The Strokes’ in 2001. Two years later, <em>Contra</em> took that model and gave it a twist on tracks like the almost-too-jaunty ‘Holiday’ and the almost-too-manic ‘Cousins’. When that record placed seventh on my 2010 list I noted how pleasant a surprise it was that the band had managed to recapture the magic of their debut and replicate its infectious energy.</p>\n<p>And then <em>Modern Vampires of the City</em> (2013) threw me for a loop. A little darker, quite a bit stranger, more… mature, if that’s the right word. Vampire Weekend had shifted gears on me, and despite the fact that the album still features perhaps my favourite of the band’s songs (‘Diane Young’), I wasn’t sure how to make the transition. In a weird way, <em>Father of the Bride</em> has returned me to its precursor with new admiration. What the band began six years ago they deliver in spades on this year’s record.</p>\n<p>Lead single ‘This Life’ is the sort of song that sounds like it always existed, just waiting for someone to intone the magic words to bring it into being. Ezra Koenig’s always smart lyricism does the trick, and we receive another gem of a pop song as a result.</p>\n<p>But Vampire Weekend are reaching for more here. It’s a smart decision to pair Koenig’s (still immediately recognisable) voice with a female guest, and Danielle Haim proves a perfect partner. It’s just one of several signs that the band feel assured enough at this stage to relax away from 3-minute pop-rock jewels, and explore other avenues. At 18 tracks and an hour of running time, <em>Father of the Bride</em> gives them plenty of room to do so, and they don’t waste a moment of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-toro-y-moi--outer-peace\">6. Toro y Moi — <em>Outer Peace</em></h3>\n<p>Third time on the list in a row for Chaz Bear’s one man hazy vibe machine. In 2015 <em>What For?</em> made 4th, and two years later / ago <em>Boo Boo</em> sat at 13th. In all honesty, there’s not too much to tell the albums apart; if there are musical evolutions here they’re minimal. I for one am quite happy, however, to have one of these records every couple of years – laid back beats, warm, fuzzy production, and Bear’s easygoing vocal delivery remain a tonic.</p>\n<p>‘Ordinary Pleasure’ is an effortlessly catchy celebration of art and life in general (and the video’s fun); ‘Who I Am’ is a danceable minimal gem; and ‘Miss Me’ is all space and mood. But the album’s high point for me remains ‘Freelance’, with it’s weird Animal Collective-inspired vocal tic, and typical TyM lyrics mixing the prosaic &amp; profound:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals<br>\nI can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old<br>\nI can’t hear you, maybe you could change your tone<br>\nPeople tend to listen when they see your soul</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"5-jimmy-eat-world--surviving\">5. Jimmy Eat World — <em>Surviving</em></h3>\n<p>OK, here’s the formula: first you make sure you have one of the year’s best album covers, then you sequence the album so that you start with a statement-of-intent title track, then you start that track with one of the most Jimmy Eat World guitar riffs imaginable. That’s how you kick off a rock record that will get my attention in 2019, and it’s also how you make your return to this list after more than a decade. Don’t get me wrong, 2016’s <em>Integrity Blues</em> wasn’t a bad record, and there were things to like on <em>Invented</em> (2010) (I barely remember <em>Damage</em> (2013) however; I’m not 100% sure that album exists). But it’s been a long time since Jimmy Eat World made a record that felt genuinely great, and the excellent news is that <em>Surviving</em> is as good an album as they’ve ever made. I still play <em>Clarity</em> (1999) &amp; <em>Bleed American</em> (2001) a fair bit, and I can see myself adding this LP to that rotation.</p>\n<p>Take, as just one example, ‘All the Way (Stay)’ - the kind of heartfelt, keenly urgent rock song this band are uniquely capable of writing on their best days. This is a record that suggests those are not all behind them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-sigrid--sucker-punch\">4. Sigrid — <em>Sucker Punch</em></h3>\n<p>Last year Robyn dropped an album called <em>Honey</em> that didn’t make my list, but has grown on me quite a bit since. I mention that here because on <em>Sucker Punch</em> Sigrid is working side by side with her Scandinavian sister in the dance-infused electro-pop mines, and boy is she digging out some jewels.</p>\n<p>The album’s title track is a crystal clear, simple slice of joy. ‘Mine Right Now’ feigns innocence for its first 30 seconds and then hits you right in whatever part of your brain responds to synth-driven anthems. And those are just the first two of a dozen near-flawless, glittering pop gems. There are tracks like ‘Don’t Kill My Vibe’ and ‘Level Up’ that are unafraid to dive into more personal, emotional lyricism, but I dare you not to sing along after you’ve heard them a couple of times.</p>\n<p>There are no tricks here, just an assured, lilting vocal style and a cache of catchy tunes produced as simply as you like. That will get you in the top five only if you bring the songwriting goods, and Sigrid’s basket is full. More please.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-madison-cunningham--who-are-you-now\">3. Madison Cunningham — <em>Who Are You Now</em></h3>\n<p>This was an album that captured me right from the first listen: simple arrangements — rooted in country / folk / bluegrass — and a voice that sounds like clear running water. I was reminded of the stark beauty of Laura Marling’s debut, with a shade of something sharper, à la Jenny Lewis (see eg. the development of ‘Song in My Head’ for a good example of the mix).</p>\n<p>There’s a lightness and a freshness to the album that belies some of its lyrical weight, with Cunningham’s voice effortlessly somersaulting over (deceptively complex) acoustic guitar. ‘Something To Believe In’ features an expressive piano arrangement as an exception to prove the rule. This lightness of touch mixed with often stark emotion has secured the record a Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Americana Album’, which feels richly deserved even if I’m not sure of the category definition.</p>\n<p>Released in summer, this has really come into its own for me as the days got colder and the evenings longer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-jade-bird--jade-bird\">2. Jade Bird — <em>Jade Bird</em></h3>\n<p>First you have to get over the voice: it sounds like it’s that of a seasoned folk-rock trooper who has been on the road since the 70s with a pack of Marlboros tucked in her sleeve, but it actually belongs to a 22 year old from Northumberland.</p>\n<p>Once you’re past that you can enjoy some of the most enjoyable, well crafted voice-and-a-guitar songs I’ve heard in quite some time. Like a louder, brasher Laura Marling who sounds like she might have a knife in her boot, Bird lays out beautiful, impassioned stories of love and loss one after another as though it’s easy to do. The voice <em>or</em> the songwriting would likely place this record on this List, but the combination has it at number two because it’s nothing short of magical.</p>\n<p>Sliding up four notes in the final moments of ‘Side Effects’, shifting from fragile to indomitable on ‘My Motto’, or somehow conveying both regret and strength in the same line: “Are you sure you wanna do this now?” (‘Ruins’). There’s also a key change on that last song (in fact the album’s opener) which just about kills me every time. And those are just the first examples that come to mind.</p>\n<p>‘Uh Huh’ &amp; ‘Good at It’ are a kind of one-two punch of an update to Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, and in fact the comparison feels apt. This is top tier songwriting and one of the most compelling deliveries I’ve heard in some time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-taylor-swift--lover\">1. Taylor Swift — <em>Lover</em></h3>\n<p>It seems to me that each of the past few years when putting together this list I’ve mounted a case for one straight-ahead pop record or another. (Tove Styrke’s <em>Sway</em> (#13 last year) being the most recent example.) It felt inevitable that at some point one of those records was going to plant its flag this deep in my heart. Top spot this year goes to the record I played more than any other, by the artist I played more than any other.\nAccording to Music I’ve listened to 1,155 hours’ of music this year. That’s 143 different artists, and 186 different releases. And yet seven out of my top ten most listened-to tracks, including the entire top five, come from one record. And I’m not nearly done playing any of them. In reverse order then:</p>\n<p>• ‘I Forgot that You Existed’: the album opener is the sound of someone reclaiming their power with as assured a light touch as you can imagine. A sparse musical bed over which Swift’s voice floats, saying goodbye to something she doesn’t need anymore.</p>\n<p>• ‘The Man’: an upbeat synth-pop masterpiece by way of feminist anthem, and like every song here entirely impossible not to sing along to every time you hear it.</p>\n<p>• ‘The Archer’: a downbeat synth-pop masterpiece showcasing Swift at her most emotionally vulnerable as it builds to something more powerful.</p>\n<p>• ‘You Need to Calm Down’: instantly ranks alongside my favourite pop tracks of all time. The five layered “uh ohs” of the bridge have pretty much been stuck in my head all year. A beautiful, righteous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>• ‘Lover’: my most-listened to song of 2019 is an exquisite, tender ballad about holding close that which you love.</p>\n<p>And then there’s ‘Paper Rings’, ‘ME!’, ‘I Think He Knows’….</p>\n<p>It’s kind of fitting that it’s Swift who takes this giant leap for pop music kind and claims top spot on my List. I’ve been increasingly impressed with her as a cultural figure since she handled the whole Kanye West / VMAs debacle with such grace. It was Swift’s protest that single-handedly got Apple to agree to pay artists when their music was listened to during the free trial period of the Music streaming service. And most recently she has been both an increasingly vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and an increasingly visible opponent of industry practices that place record companies entirely in control of artists’ work.</p>\n<p>So, alongside becoming the most decorated performer in the history of the American Music Awards, and being heralded their ‘Artist of the Decade’, here’s another trophy for Taylor’s shelf: she made my favourite album of 2019.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Caterina Barbieri — *Ecstatic Computation*\n\nAccording to [her (neo-GeoCities) website](https://caterinabarbieri.com), Barbieri ‘explores the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations in music, by investigating the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers to draw severe, complex geometries in time and space’. That’s a better explanation than I can offer as to how her music operates. Often sparse it still has the ability to surprise through the unexpected ways in which the rhythms play around and off each other. The 10-plus minutes of opener ‘Fantas’ is a sonic world all its own; dark echoes give birth to bright synths, which in turn make way for mellower, fuzzier tones. It’s a headphone album right down to its sonic DNA, and when I made time to listen to it that way I enjoyed it enormously.\n\n\n###  19. CHAI — *Punk*\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Nisennenmondai infiltrated the ranks of Go! Team, I have your answer. CHAI is an all-female Japanese pop-rock ensemble who make one heck of a racket. I have very little idea what’s going on in most of these tracks – the lyrics are a mix of Japanese and heavily-accented English – but it never matters. Killer bass lines conspire with super-catchy synths and a combination of live and programmed drums to make the kind of 32 minute record that leaves you desperate to find out what this all looks and sounds like live. It’s dayglo bright and not at all nuanced, and the weirdness of understanding only every fifth lyric never really goes away, but joy and enthusiasm just radiates from it in waves. And in 2019, there’s nothing more punk than that.\n\n\n###  18. Thom Yorke — *ANIMA*\n\nPerhaps it’s misleading, but increasingly it feels possible to discern what each member of Radiohead brings to their collaborative project by examining their solo output. Ed O’Brien’s recent single ‘Brasil’ starts out folksy and grounded, before being lifted (by Colin Greenwood’s bass no less) into a different place: somewhere looser, groovier, and more danceable. Jony Greenwood’s film scores have given a glimpse of the expanse and complexity of his musical thinking. And Thom Yorke keeps making weird, dark electronica records.\n\n*ANIMA* feels even more insular to me than previous releases, trapped in its own head, or else providing a release for someone who otherwise would be. It’s still seductive, and beautifully crafted, but despite knowing I was holding its composer to a higher standard, I couldn’t help but note the lack of an ‘Analyse’, ‘Harrowdown Hill’, or ‘A Brain in a Bottle’ here.\n\n###  17. Charly Bliss — *Young Enough*\n\nYou might remember Charly Bliss’s debut (*Guppy*) from my 2017 list, or the highlight of the album, ‘Ruby’, as one of my songs of that year. Their follow up is more of the same: bubblegum-adjacent melodies and an arch vocal delivery of largely diaristic lyrics. It’s fun stuff, and catchy in a lot of the right places. The playing has tightened up a little bit, and it feels as though a decision has been taken to polish the production a bit more than previously. There are still loose ends and plenty of energy, but it doesn’t feel as raw as before. Even so, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of a second helping of Charly Bliss. One listen through opener ‘Blown to Bits’ will tell you whether it might also be your thing. (PS. That track opens with a synth chord so close to the one that opens Weezer’s 1996 b-side ‘I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams’ that I refuse to believe it’s coincidence.)\n\n###  16. Anderson .Paak — *Ventura*\n\nAnderson .Paak is an artist I’ve struggled to get a handle on. But, after dipping into 2016’s *Yes Lawd!*, and (unwittingly) skipping 2018’s *Oxnard*, I immediately vibed with the latter’s sister album: *Ventura*.\n\nOpener ‘Come Home’ is like an extended title sequence, featuring some gold standard Andre 3000 bars. Then it’s on to the soulful relationship therapy of ‘Make it Better’, pairing Anderson’s rich vocals with those of none other than Smokey Robinson. From there its warm, honey-toned production, smart lyrics, and laid back beats all the way, through lead single ‘King James’ all the way until ‘What Can We Do?’ closes the record with the best Nate Dogg feature since ’21 Questions’ (2002).\n\n###  15. Beirut — *Gallipoli*\n\nBeirut is one of those bands that have long been on the periphery of my awareness, and which I knew I should be paying more attention to. Now, as with Spoon’s *They Want My Soul* (2014) and Low’s *Double Negative* (2018), a record has finally captured my full attention. Gallipoli is manifestly the work of creators very comfortable in their artistic skins. Lyrically and tonally melancholy, but musically expansive and exploratory, there’s a warmth at its heart that never dims even in its darker moments. Album high point ‘Gauze für Zah’ is an exemplar of the record’s broad sonic palate, Zach Condon’s drifting, melodic vocal, and the manner in which Beirut are often content to let compositions develop at an unforced pace rather than force a strict structure.\n\nThis won’t be for everyone, but it was a record unlike many others I heard this year, and I was grateful to it for bringing Beirut more squarely into focus for me.\n\n###  14. James Blake — *Assume Form*\n\nThis album came along so early in the year (18 Jan) that I wasn’t sure it would stick around for me, but I’ve played it fairly regularly all year. I know a lot of people call out Blake’s voice as a highlight of his work; I find it very effective (particularly in its higher register), but I would also take an album full of his giddy, kaleidoscopic sonic compositions without the vocals. In fact, the better vocal performances on this record belong to Travis Scott on album highlight ‘Mile High’, and ROSALÍA on the haunting, off-kilter ‘Barefoot in the Park’.\n\nThe tempo remains staid throughout, but there’s a range of modes here, between which Blake switches without missing a beat. I find him to be an intriguing musician, and one I can’t quite place comfortably. Somewhere on an archipelago off the coast of electronica, he’s just doing his own thing.\n\n###  13. Foals — *Part 1 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost*\n\nI had Foals’ debut, *Antidotes*, on release in 2008 and I was ready to file them away with other art-math-rock bands like Klaxons, whose debut (*Myths of the Near Future*) I had admired but not loved the year before. It’s been a welcome surprise to watch Foals grow, and their sonic palate complicate and evolve to something that I can only describe as Biffy Clyro covering The Mars Volta. *What Went Down* (2015) very nearly made my top 20 of that year, largely on the strength of its unassailably huge title track, and now we’re here.\n\nDouble albums are always enormously ambitious projects, and by virtue of the two halves having been released separately I have to consider them individually. You won’t find Part 2 of *ENSWBL* on this list: its late-October release date hasn’t allowed me time to digest it enough. Part 1 has remained on heavy rotation since March, however, and despite that I feel like there’s still plenty more in there for me to discover.\n\n###  12. Tyler, The Creator — *IGOR*\n\nI’m not sure where to start with this record. The palate is hip-hop infused with jazz touches, soul, gospel, and funk. The record opens with an extended synth tone that keys you to the texture of what follows, but what follows is a shifting thing. First track proper, ‘EARFQUAKE’ was originally written for (but rejected by) Justin Bieber, so Tyler has turned it into a downbeat pean that has shrugged itself free of anything like traditional song structure. And once you’re on the ride, you have little choice but to strap in and enjoy it; this is an album in the proper sense of the word - obviously intended to be experienced as a whole. A moody melange of twilight production, treated vocals that see Tyler pushing his singing voice as much as he raps, songs that ‘end’ and then continue… twice.\n\nAbove all else it’s the sheer inventiveness of the song structures, and the compelling production that kept me coming back. I didn’t hear a finer hip-hop record this year.\n\n###  11. Wand — *Laughing Matter*\n\nI’ve long wondered, sometimes aloud, why no one else makes music that sounds anything like Radiohead. My first impression upon hearing *Laughing Matter* was that Wand are also at least at the same dance, even if they’re moving a bit differently to the Oxford quintet.\n\nCory Hanson’s soft, tuneful vocals; Lee Landey’s inquisitive bass lines; Evan Burrows’s restless, inventive percussion… it all adds up to something very impressive. Add in Robert Cody’s brilliantly judged guitar - always happy to play a supporting role that makes each track better - and Sofie Arreguin’s synths adding colour and sonic texture, and you have an album that blooms into something genuinely special.\n\nAside from the, admittedly terrible, none-more-psych-rock album cover, the only disappointment is that the track ‘High Planes Drifter’ isn’t a cover of the 1989 Beastie Boys cut.\n\n###  10. The Regrettes — *How Do You Love?*\n\nI just looked back at my list from 2017 and apparently The Regrettes’ debut (*Feel Your Feelings Fool*) didn’t make the final cut. That surprised me, because in retrospect it’s one of the albums from that year that has had the most staying power for me. And now I have this excellent follow-up to file right alongside it.\n\nAt heart the record is nothing more complicated than a set of relationship songs (from love songs, to break up songs and everything in between), all laid out in frontwoman Lydia Night’s smoky, bluesy vocal, underpinned by soulful bass lines and bright percussion. With the sound having evolved a hair away from the debut’s punk notes the guitar is a little bit pop and a little bit classic 50s rock n’ roll. I fully expect to be playing album highlights ‘California Friends’, ‘ I Dare You’ and ‘Pumpkin’ for years to come.\n\n### 9. Floating Points — *Crush*\n\nMy only other touchstone for the term ‘floating points’ is a measurement of computing power: FLOPS, or floating point operations per second. And to me it feels as though there’s something apt about the name chosen by neuroscientist & epigeneticist Sam Shepherd for his musical project. Intricate, busy beats vie with dense, shifting loops for the listener’s attention; the listening experience is akin to visiting a gallery of impressionist visual art - sometimes bewildering, at points confrontational, but constantly intriguing and compelling.\n\nThere are more easygoing moments, such as ‘Anasickmodular’ with its house beat buried deep in the mix under layers of shifting sonic sands. And there are danceable moments like ‘LesAlpx’ with its room-sized bass. It’s a record that ends up feeling far more than the sum of its parts, and one I’ll likely sit down with again and again when I have a good pair of headphones to hand.\n\n###  8. Fennesz — *Agora*\n\nIt was an odd year for me and electronic / ambient music. I heard a lot of stuff I liked, but nothing quite hit me in the way LPs by Nicolas Jaar, Takeleave, Shigeto, Loscil, and Submerse etc. have in years past. Agora is the highest placing such album on this year’s list, and the closest thing I encountered to an experience like some of those listed above.\n\nAgora is actually more toward the ambient end of the spectrum. Really what you’re getting here is a quartet of what I’ve spoken of in the past as aural landscapes. This kind of sonic topography has only grown in appeal for me over the years, and Fennesz is working in the same mould as Ryuichi Sakamoto and William Basinski. When I took the time to spend with it properly, I loved it. At other times it acted as slightly odd background music to several meals.\n\nMy end of year Music Replay lists Four Tet amongst my most played artists of 2019, and his studio output this year was a pair of singles. Which is to say that, unable to find truly stellar new electronica, I fell back on old favourites. Fennesz, at least, gave me something new and substantial to immerse myself in.\n\n###  7. Vampire Weekend — *Father of the Bride*\n\nWithout necessarily knowing it, I’ve been waiting for this record for six years. I don’t have a copy of my lists as far back as Vampire Weekend’s eponymous 2008 debut, but I’m guessing it placed high. That album – featuring the perennial modern classics ‘A-Punk’, ‘Oxford Comma’ et al – was the most effortlessly cool arrival on the musical stage since The Strokes’ in 2001. Two years later, *Contra* took that model and gave it a twist on tracks like the almost-too-jaunty ‘Holiday’ and the almost-too-manic ‘Cousins’. When that record placed seventh on my 2010 list I noted how pleasant a surprise it was that the band had managed to recapture the magic of their debut and replicate its infectious energy.\n\nAnd then *Modern Vampires of the City* (2013) threw me for a loop. A little darker, quite a bit stranger, more… mature, if that’s the right word. Vampire Weekend had shifted gears on me, and despite the fact that the album still features perhaps my favourite of the band’s songs (‘Diane Young’), I wasn’t sure how to make the transition. In a weird way, *Father of the Bride* has returned me to its precursor with new admiration. What the band began six years ago they deliver in spades on this year’s record.\n\nLead single ‘This Life’ is the sort of song that sounds like it always existed, just waiting for someone to intone the magic words to bring it into being. Ezra Koenig’s always smart lyricism does the trick, and we receive another gem of a pop song as a result.\n\nBut Vampire Weekend are reaching for more here. It’s a smart decision to pair Koenig’s (still immediately recognisable) voice with a female guest, and Danielle Haim proves a perfect partner. It’s just one of several signs that the band feel assured enough at this stage to relax away from 3-minute pop-rock jewels, and explore other avenues. At 18 tracks and an hour of running time, *Father of the Bride* gives them plenty of room to do so, and they don’t waste a moment of it.\n\n###  6. Toro y Moi — *Outer Peace*\n\nThird time on the list in a row for Chaz Bear’s one man hazy vibe machine. In 2015 *What For?* made 4th, and two years later / ago *Boo Boo* sat at 13th. In all honesty, there’s not too much to tell the albums apart; if there are musical evolutions here they’re minimal. I for one am quite happy, however, to have one of these records every couple of years – laid back beats, warm, fuzzy production, and Bear’s easygoing vocal delivery remain a tonic.\n\n‘Ordinary Pleasure’ is an effortlessly catchy celebration of art and life in general (and the video’s fun); ‘Who I Am’ is a danceable minimal gem; and ‘Miss Me’ is all space and mood. But the album’s high point for me remains ‘Freelance’, with it’s weird Animal Collective-inspired vocal tic, and typical TyM lyrics mixing the prosaic & profound:\n\n> No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals  \n> I can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old  \n> I can’t hear you, maybe you could change your tone  \n> People tend to listen when they see your soul  \n\n###  5. Jimmy Eat World — *Surviving*\n\nOK, here’s the formula: first you make sure you have one of the year’s best album covers, then you sequence the album so that you start with a statement-of-intent title track, then you start that track with one of the most Jimmy Eat World guitar riffs imaginable. That’s how you kick off a rock record that will get my attention in 2019, and it’s also how you make your return to this list after more than a decade. Don’t get me wrong, 2016’s *Integrity Blues* wasn’t a bad record, and there were things to like on *Invented* (2010) (I barely remember *Damage* (2013) however; I’m not 100% sure that album exists). But it’s been a long time since Jimmy Eat World made a record that felt genuinely great, and the excellent news is that *Surviving* is as good an album as they’ve ever made. I still play *Clarity* (1999) & *Bleed American* (2001) a fair bit, and I can see myself adding this LP to that rotation.\n\nTake, as just one example, ‘All the Way (Stay)’ - the kind of heartfelt, keenly urgent rock song this band are uniquely capable of writing on their best days. This is a record that suggests those are not all behind them.\n\n###  4. Sigrid — *Sucker Punch*\n\nLast year Robyn dropped an album called *Honey* that didn’t make my list, but has grown on me quite a bit since. I mention that here because on *Sucker Punch* Sigrid is working side by side with her Scandinavian sister in the dance-infused electro-pop mines, and boy is she digging out some jewels.\n\nThe album’s title track is a crystal clear, simple slice of joy. ‘Mine Right Now’ feigns innocence for its first 30 seconds and then hits you right in whatever part of your brain responds to synth-driven anthems. And those are just the first two of a dozen near-flawless, glittering pop gems. There are tracks like ‘Don’t Kill My Vibe’ and ‘Level Up’ that are unafraid to dive into more personal, emotional lyricism, but I dare you not to sing along after you’ve heard them a couple of times.\n\nThere are no tricks here, just an assured, lilting vocal style and a cache of catchy tunes produced as simply as you like. That will get you in the top five only if you bring the songwriting goods, and Sigrid’s basket is full. More please.\n\n###  3. Madison Cunningham — *Who Are You Now*\n\nThis was an album that captured me right from the first listen: simple arrangements — rooted in country / folk / bluegrass — and a voice that sounds like clear running water. I was reminded of the stark beauty of Laura Marling’s debut, with a shade of something sharper, à la Jenny Lewis (see eg. the development of ‘Song in My Head’ for a good example of the mix). \n\nThere’s a lightness and a freshness to the album that belies some of its lyrical weight, with Cunningham’s voice effortlessly somersaulting over (deceptively complex) acoustic guitar. ‘Something To Believe In’ features an expressive piano arrangement as an exception to prove the rule. This lightness of touch mixed with often stark emotion has secured the record a Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Americana Album’, which feels richly deserved even if I’m not sure of the category definition. \n\nReleased in summer, this has really come into its own for me as the days got colder and the evenings longer.\n\n###  2. Jade Bird — *Jade Bird*\n\nFirst you have to get over the voice: it sounds like it’s that of a seasoned folk-rock trooper who has been on the road since the 70s with a pack of Marlboros tucked in her sleeve, but it actually belongs to a 22 year old from Northumberland.\n\nOnce you’re past that you can enjoy some of the most enjoyable, well crafted voice-and-a-guitar songs I’ve heard in quite some time. Like a louder, brasher Laura Marling who sounds like she might have a knife in her boot, Bird lays out beautiful, impassioned stories of love and loss one after another as though it’s easy to do. The voice *or* the songwriting would likely place this record on this List, but the combination has it at number two because it’s nothing short of magical.\n\nSliding up four notes in the final moments of ‘Side Effects’, shifting from fragile to indomitable on ‘My Motto’, or somehow conveying both regret and strength in the same line: “Are you sure you wanna do this now?” (‘Ruins’). There’s also a key change on that last song (in fact the album’s opener) which just about kills me every time. And those are just the first examples that come to mind.\n\n‘Uh Huh’ & ‘Good at It’ are a kind of one-two punch of an update to Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, and in fact the comparison feels apt. This is top tier songwriting and one of the most compelling deliveries I’ve heard in some time.\n\n###  1. Taylor Swift — *Lover*\n\nIt seems to me that each of the past few years when putting together this list I’ve mounted a case for one straight-ahead pop record or another. (Tove Styrke’s *Sway* (#13 last year) being the most recent example.) It felt inevitable that at some point one of those records was going to plant its flag this deep in my heart. Top spot this year goes to the record I played more than any other, by the artist I played more than any other.\nAccording to Music I’ve listened to 1,155 hours’ of music this year. That’s 143 different artists, and 186 different releases. And yet seven out of my top ten most listened-to tracks, including the entire top five, come from one record. And I’m not nearly done playing any of them. In reverse order then:\n\n• ‘I Forgot that You Existed’: the album opener is the sound of someone reclaiming their power with as assured a light touch as you can imagine. A sparse musical bed over which Swift’s voice floats, saying goodbye to something she doesn’t need anymore.\n\n• ‘The Man’: an upbeat synth-pop masterpiece by way of feminist anthem, and like every song here entirely impossible not to sing along to every time you hear it.\n\n• ‘The Archer’: a downbeat synth-pop masterpiece showcasing Swift at her most emotionally vulnerable as it builds to something more powerful. \n\n• ‘You Need to Calm Down’: instantly ranks alongside my favourite pop tracks of all time. The five layered “uh ohs” of the bridge have pretty much been stuck in my head all year. A beautiful, righteous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community. \n\n• ‘Lover’: my most-listened to song of 2019 is an exquisite, tender ballad about holding close that which you love. \n\nAnd then there’s ‘Paper Rings’, ‘ME!’, ‘I Think He Knows’….\n\nIt’s kind of fitting that it’s Swift who takes this giant leap for pop music kind and claims top spot on my List. I’ve been increasingly impressed with her as a cultural figure since she handled the whole Kanye West / VMAs debacle with such grace. It was Swift’s protest that single-handedly got Apple to agree to pay artists when their music was listened to during the free trial period of the Music streaming service. And most recently she has been both an increasingly vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and an increasingly visible opponent of industry practices that place record companies entirely in control of artists’ work. \n\nSo, alongside becoming the most decorated performer in the history of the American Music Awards, and being heralded their ‘Artist of the Decade’, here’s another trophy for Taylor’s shelf: she made my favourite album of 2019.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

JAGUWAR — <em>Ringthing</em></h3>\n<p>Sometimes you need some shoegaze. Or, rather, sometimes I just need a sound I can hide my head inside like a great cloud of candyfloss. The peddles are less aggressively tuned, and the layering of tracks frequently too sparse for this to be considered <em>true</em> shoegaze, but JAGUWAR have put my bloody valentine and Battles in a blender, with a dash of The Cure, and poured something out. Sometimes it sounds amiably mournful (‘Crystal’), sometimes it’s mournfully amiable (‘Away’). In either case, I’ve been happy to spend quite a bit of time with headphones on letting this rain down on me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-john-tejada--dead-start-program\">19. John Tejada — <em>Dead Start Program</em></h3>\n<p>Headphone electronica from a journeyman of the genre. This is a record that is uneven in terms of its moods, but unflagging in terms of quality. Tempos and timbres alter from track to track – frenetic and impatient on ‘All at Sea’, upbeat and celebratory on ‘Heal’ – but throughout there’s an attention to detail, and a well-honed sense of experimentation that keeps the listener guessing and the rhythms interesting. Album highlight for me since first listen has been the joyously off-kilter ‘Detector’, which seems to dare you to connect either with its cheeky melody or its grimy bass, and then try to marry the two in your mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-snail-mail--lush\">18. Snail Mail — <em>Lush</em></h3>\n<p>I closed last year’s list with a note on my amazement that Jay Som’s <em>Everybody Works</em> had emerged from one woman’s bedroom a finished and singular project. I’d like to reiterate those sentiments here with respect to <em>Lush</em> – I don’t understand how a 19 year old can listen (in all likelihood) to a whole bunch of Sonic Youth and Elliot Smith records, and then produce something this heartfelt and eloquent. Even though, in this instance, she’s playing with a band rather than multi-instrumenting it, the question remains: how does one find one’s artistic voice with such clarity? In particular there are some really nice lyrical moments here that elevate simple but effective song structures to something very memorable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-this-will-destroy-you--new-others-part-one--two\">17. This Will Destroy You — <em>New Others Part One / Two</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve been awaiting a new TWDY release since I discovered their self-titled album a few years ago in a lull between Explosions in the Sky LPs. And that’s what’s on offer here. Given to slightly less bombast than their fellow Texans, but painting with similar colours in a similar style, this is wide open music with a big heart and dreams as big as its regrets.</p>\n<p>Two albums by the same band, which share a title, but were released weeks apart. So… you’re not going to let me have both, are you? In which case I choose the slightly more familiar, warm embrace of <em>New Others Part One</em> over the marginally more experimental, slightly rougher-around-the-edges, <em>…Part Two</em>. If only they’d released this as a double album though!</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-black-belt-eagle-scout--mother-of-my-children\">16. Black Belt Eagle Scout — <em>Mother of My Children</em></h3>\n<p>The DNA of this record sounds more complicated to me with each passing listen. What I thought, at first, was a relatively straightforward collection of heartfelt, understated indie-folk started to express different parts of itself the more I replayed the album. There’s some Hole in there somewhere, and some influences or at least similarities with other acts on Saddle Creek. The guitars are by turns strummed or else distorted and contorted. The drums sometimes think they’d like to be on a different album. The vocals are perhaps the most consistent element of the record’s shifting composition, but they’re used to convey lyrics that first burn then soothe; that are twisted with grief, and then adamant with resilience.</p>\n<p>All of this starts to make more sense when you learn that the woman behind the record – it’s a solo project by Katherine Paul – identifies as a radical indigenous queer feminist. This is an album that is grown from the soil of both personal losses, and the protests at Standing Rock. It strives to capture something both intimate and universal about loss and change. And from the fuzzed up opener ‘Soft Stud’ to the sad, slight closer ‘Sam, A Dream’, it succeeds again and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-oh-pep--i-wasnt-only-thinking-about-you\">15. Oh Pep! — <em>I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You…</em></h3>\n<p>Listening to this record calls up for me a history of enjoying the output of Laura Veirs, Azure Ray, Jenny Lewis et al. It’s a lightly whipped mix of indie guitar and personal vocals with the kind of modest scale that means I would rather see them perform at Camden Lock than Brixton Academy. There’s a cute PR backstory about how the two members met by accident and formed a band out of necessity, but the important part is that their twin vocals work superbly well together. The instrumentation is relatively slight, and everything is handled with a deft lightness of touch, counterpointing the sometimes downbeat lyrics. This isn’t a record that demands much of the listener, but provides excellent company whether used as walking-around music, or bright afternoon stereo listening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-screaming-females--all-at-once\">14. Screaming Females — <em>All At Once</em></h3>\n<p>The bedrock of Screaming Females’ sound is a combination of moderately treated guitar, fuzzed-up bass, and largely simple-but-effective drums. Theirs is a sound that, if encountered on the radio, would these days leave you guessing which of the last three decades it had come from. The key is doing it well, and this record is proof enough that the formula still works. The band’s marquee attraction comes in the form of Marissa Paternoster’s vocals. There’s a little Kim Deal here, and a dash of Laura Jane Grace: as driving as the guitars, as rough edged as the bass, and as straight-to-business as the drums. The record’s signature attraction for me is her ability to wind the vocal melodies around her own impressive guitar lines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-tove-styrke--sway\">13. Tove Styrke — <em>Sway</em></h3>\n<p>Pop music! Who doesn’t love (some of) it? Over the years I’ve learned to accept that when a song or album or artist just <em>works</em> for me, I shouldn’t question it, just enjoy it. So, here’s the third album by a Swedish electropop artist I’ve never heard of before.</p>\n<p>‘Mistakes’ is a brain limpet of a potency only equalled by a few songs this year; one of them is titled ‘Sway’ and it opens this album with an impossible-to-follow dopamine pop of pure, fleeting pleasure.</p>\n<p>Will I still be listening to this album in a couple of years? Unlikely. Did it offer me a lot of unfiltered joy this year? Yes, yes it did.</p>\n<p>(For the record, my favourite pop song of the year was probably Ariana Grande’s ‘the light is coming’.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-young-fathers--cocoa-sugar\">12. Young Fathers — <em>Cocoa Sugar</em></h3>\n<p>Like most, I first encountered Young Fathers when they won the Mercury in 2014. I’m remiss in not doing my due diligence in the years since, only catching up with their second LP (<em>White Men are Black Men Too</em> (2015)) late. But I was there for the release of <em>Cocoa Sugar</em>, which immediately won a place on this list with its mercurial strangeness. Like a more introverted TV On The Radio, this is a group that seems to make its music by taking a melody or a bass line or a lyric, and twisting it until it deforms into something else.</p>\n<p>‘In My View’ is the album highlight, doing something with syncopation and muted vocals that I haven’t heard used as effectively since Woodkid’s ‘Iron’ (2011). But there’s plenty to love and explore here, whether it’s the dark thicket of ‘Wow’ or the upside-down anthem ‘Picking You’ that closes the record. Come for the eye-catching album cover, stay for… whatever is happening sonically here. You’ll get something from it, even if it’s difficult to predict what, exactly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-say-sue-me--where-we-were-together\">11. Say Sue Me — <em>Where We Were Together</em></h3>\n<p>If a Korean band release a pop record, is it K-pop? Actually, this couldn’t be further from the hyper-stylised output that’s increasingly making its presence felt in western charts. This is as good a collection of understated pop-verging-into-rock songs as any I heard this year. It’s warm and enthusiastic, and cribs from a whole range of western pop influences going back as far as maybe the Beach Boys. The production also has a glow to it that I really like, making it sound at times like elements were recorded in a large room, whilst the vocals remain up close and personal - sometimes barely above a whisper. The effortless, propulsive ’Old Town’ and ‘I Just Wanna Dance’ are where the record really shines, but epic closer ‘Coming to the End’ also deserves a shout out for hinting at ambition the rest of the album hadn’t showcased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-gogo-penguin--a-humdrum-star\">10. GoGo Penguin — <em>A Humdrum Star</em></h3>\n<p>I cheated a bit when searching for a way to describe GoGo Penguin (who are new to me this year despite several records and a Mercury nomination in their past). Here’s a quote pulled from their official site:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their music has been described as acoustic-electronica but they draw equally on rock, jazz and minimalism, game soundtracks and glitchy-electronica…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure that enables you to guess precisely what this record sounds like (if you haven’t heard it). For me the closest touchstone is perhaps Portico Quartet in their original incarnation, before they discovered synths. ‘Transient State’ almost runs away with itself, but deceptively complex jazz drumming keeps the piano just about in check. ‘Reactor’ rides its funky bass line down a series of tilting corridors, and ends up somewhere interesting. Sub 3-minute tracks sit alongside 8-minute plus odysseys, as this group of fine musicians seem to just enjoy exploring where they can take their sound.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-dott--heart-swell\">9. DOTT — <em>Heart Swell</em></h3>\n<p>There’s nothing new or particularly inventive about this record. I haven’t gone back through the band’s catalogue, but I’m guessing they have been doing more or less exactly this for a while. Power-chord pop, lightly treated vocals, bouncy bass lines, sometimes over-enthusiastic drum fills. They’re simple proof that these particular mines still have some gems left in them to find.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Bleached Blonde’ is a clarion call for enthusiasm, requesting that the listener throw caution to the wind and their arms to the sky. ’Like A Girl’ is a feminist anthem in the making (with a fun video to match). The stand out, for me, is the almost-too-simple ‘How Do I Feel?’: under 2 minutes of pop perfection that could have been released any year since the mid 50s, but still fresh sounding after it has been playing in my head all day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-middle-kids--lost-friends\">8. Middle Kids — <em>Lost Friends</em></h3>\n<p>Every year I have at least one record full of three minute pop songs. This year it comes from an Australian trio, and it’s a little more emotionally diverse than perhaps is usual. ‘On My Knees’ is raucous and built for festival crowds, ‘Hole’ is plaintive, ‘Please’ is anthemic and optimistic, and ‘Mistake’ just might be my favourite song of the whole year (it’s certainly among the most infectious).</p>\n<p>Hannah Joy’s vocals are characterised by a strength shot through with wavering vulnerability, and it feels as though the rest of the band’s sound has been modelled around it. This is a sweet record, but one with bruises. Its heart is on its sleeve, and it wants to link arms with you and sing together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-shinya-fukumori-trio--for-2-akis\">7. Shinya Fukumori Trio — <em>For 2 Akis</em></h3>\n<p>You might be expecting by now that each of my lists comes with a token jazz record. I listened to less of the genre than I would have liked this year, with only a handful of releases really breaking through. The most notable amongst them, and the one I played more than any other by some margin, was this debut offering by the Japanese drummer’s newly-formed ensemble. Subtle, creative percussion; sweet, explorative tenor saxophone; contemplative piano. I could listen to this sound all day, preferably on headphones so as to get the most out of the record’s production, which allows each instrument a lot of space and the listener room enough to wander between them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-low--double-negative\">6. Low — <em>Double Negative</em></h3>\n<p>Low are a band that sit squarely within my pile of shame. Formed in 1993, and with no fewer than eleven albums preceding this one, I’ve paid criminally little attention to them if this record is anything to judge by. My guess however (and it is just a guess, since I haven’t done the legwork), is that they weren’t making music that sounded like this in the mid-90s. I could be wrong, but in particular the use of decayed samples here seems very much of the moment.</p>\n<p>I love everything about this record, starting with the art direction, and on through its warm production, its subtle instrumentation, and the dreamy texture of the vocals. (This is also my headphone album of the year!) I feel like there’s at least one record every year that I say this about, but every moment of <em>Double Negative</em> speaks to a band at full command of their powers, masterfully employing every tool at their disposal to get the sound in their heads onto tape. On every listen through, 49 minutes flies by and I’m left wanting to re-experience the whole thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-beacon--gravity-pairs\">5. Beacon — <em>Gravity Pairs</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s a case of first-listen certainty. In fact, arguably, this was a near lock for the list after I had heard only the leading single ‘Be My Organ’, which remains among my favourite tracks of the year.</p>\n<p>This is an electronica of smooth, reflective surfaces, that also makes use of acoustic instrumentation (notably piano) to augment it. Layered on top are subtle vocals that are almost played like an additional instrument rather than being the focal point of any of the tracks. It’s melancholy stuff in places (eg. ‘Bending Light’), but many of the melodies are quite beautiful. The group’s most valuable talent seems to be a sense of exactly when to modulate emotions either within individual tracks, or over the album as a whole. As a result <em>Gravity Pairs</em> fits together like a polished crystal - smooth to the touch, but full of fragments and distortions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-elohim--elohim\">4. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s a slightly confusing situation. You may recall that the number 3 spot on 2016’s list was held by Elohim’s self-titled debut album. At the time she was very much talking about it as her first album, but at some point since has decided it was a 10-track EP. To make matters worse, this year she released what she now considers her debut LP… and gave it the same title.</p>\n<p>Forget all of that. It makes no difference to the fact that ‘I Want You’ is light and breezy electronic pop of the highest order, ‘F**k Your Money’ is understated and darkly sly, and ‘Panic Attacks’ is an exquisite club anthem with the volume turned waaaaay down.</p>\n<p>As far as I’m concerned, Elohim can make whatever she wants and title it whatever she likes. After these two releases, I’ll be there to find out how it gets weirder.</p>\n<p>(PS. I <em>really</em> wanted to put this at number 3, just for the symmetry, but…)</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-takeleave--inner-sea\">3. Takeleave — <em>Inner Sea</em></h3>\n<p>In a year without an album release from my soul’s resident musician Submerse, to whom am I to turn for premium grade liminal electronica™? This is literally the thought process that found me listening to everything Berlin label Project Mooncircle put out this year. And among a veritable bevy of delights I was relieved and overjoyed to find this from Takeleave. It shifts, it glows, it washes over you in waves timed to your slowing heartbeat. Call it downtempo house, or ambient techno, or broken beats… I don’t mind. This is the sound I need to frequently bathe my brain in, and it was so nice to find someone else making it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-anna-burch--quit-the-curse\">2. Anna Burch — <em>Quit the Curse</em></h3>\n<p>On her debut record, Anna Burch sounds like the finished article. And she’s bringing along a complex melding of folk, art-rock, indie, and old-fashioned pop hooks. I don’t know how she got surf-adjacent guitar to sit alongside Pavement vocal stylings. Maybe if Ben Kweller and Lana Del Ray covered Surfer Blood, and you played it back at 2/3 speed it would sound like this?</p>\n<p>However she’s managing to do it, and make it sound effortless, <em>Quit The Curse</em> is a very pretty record with its makeup smudged, wearing the same clothes it wore yesterday. I could listen to it all day. Try ‘2 Cool 2 Care’ and ‘In Your Dreams’ and you’ll either fall head over heels for it, or discover your heart has been hardened against all the world’s beauty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-aal-against-all-logic--2012-2017\">1. AAL (Against All Logic) — <em>2012-2017</em></h3>\n<p>OK, this is where the fun begins. First of all, don’t be fooled by the artist’s name: this is a new record by Nicolas Jaar, working under one of his many monikers – presumably to avoid being pigeonholed. His previous release, <em>Sirens</em> (2016), was one I struggled with leaving off my list for that year. I had no such internal conflict with this one; right from the first time I heard it (in February), I knew that <em>2012-2017</em> would make the final cut.</p>\n<p>Where I do need to make special pleading, arguably, is the fact that some of the work here has appeared within continuous mixes that Jaar has done for various outlets over the last couple of years. Many tracks are entirely new, but portions of a few have cropped up before. Nevertheless, this is the first time any of the work has been released in record format, so I’m claiming it.</p>\n<p>This is precisely at the epicentre of one of my favourite electronica subgenres: endlessly exploratory, and happy to bring in influences from all over the musical spectrum to colour its own sound. Opener ‘This Old House Is All I Have’ twists blues into the mix, album highlight ’Know You’ hijacks soul and funk… and so on. But the record’s sound is also miraculously cohesive and quite singular, providing consistent thrills throughout. Some of music’s most thrilling moments of 2018 are contained herein for me, and they’re couched in a shifting bed of melody that I was absolutely entranced by.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"notable-mentions-aka-the-next-30-in-alphabetical-order\">Notable Mentions (aka the next 30, in alphabetical order)</h3>\n<p>• The Beths – Future Me Hates Me<br>\n• The Breeders – All Nerve<br>\n• Cat Power – Wanderer<br>\n• Chastity – Death Lust<br>\n• Cosmic Thoughts – Work Night Out<br>\n• CUTS – A Gradual Decline<br>\n• Lucy Dacus – Historian<br>\n• Djrum – Portrait With Firewood<br>\n• Father John Misty – God’s Favorite Customer<br>\n• Forth Wanderers – Forth Wanderers<br>\n• GoGo Penguin – A Humdrum Star<br>\n• Mass Gothic – I’ve Tortured You Long Enough<br>\n• Holly Miranda – Mutual Horse<br>\n• Nas – NASIR<br>\n• Prefuse 73 – Sacrifices<br>\n• Profligate – Somewhere Else<br>\n• Proud Parents – Proud Parents<br>\n• Rejoicer – Energy Dreams<br>\n• Rival Consoles – Persona<br>\n• Robyn – Honey<br>\n• Caroline Rose – Loner<br>\n• Jeff Rosenstock – POST–<br>\n• Ross From Friends – Family Portrait<br>\n• Superchunk – What A Time To Be Alive<br>\n• TSVI – Inner Worlds<br>\n• Tangents – New Bodies<br>\n• Tanukichan – Sundays<br>\n• Throwing Snow – Loma<br>\n• Tirzah – Devotion<br>\n• ZHU – RINGOS BEACH</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

This year it comes from an Australian trio, and it’s a little more emotionally diverse than perhaps is usual. ‘On My Knees’ is raucous and built for festival crowds, ‘Hole’ is plaintive, ‘Please’ is anthemic and optimistic, and ‘Mistake’ just might be my favourite song of the whole year (it’s certainly among the most infectious). \n\nHannah Joy’s vocals are characterised by a strength shot through with wavering vulnerability, and it feels as though the rest of the band’s sound has been modelled around it. This is a sweet record, but one with bruises. Its heart is on its sleeve, and it wants to link arms with you and sing together.\n\n###  7. Shinya Fukumori Trio — *For 2 Akis*\n\nYou might be expecting by now that each of my lists comes with a token jazz record. I listened to less of the genre than I would have liked this year, with only a handful of releases really breaking through. The most notable amongst them, and the one I played more than any other by some margin, was this debut offering by the Japanese drummer’s newly-formed ensemble. Subtle, creative percussion; sweet, explorative tenor saxophone; contemplative piano. I could listen to this sound all day, preferably on headphones so as to get the most out of the record’s production, which allows each instrument a lot of space and the listener room enough to wander between them. \n\n###  6. Low — *Double Negative*\n\nLow are a band that sit squarely within my pile of shame. Formed in 1993, and with no fewer than eleven albums preceding this one, I’ve paid criminally little attention to them if this record is anything to judge by. My guess however (and it is just a guess, since I haven’t done the legwork), is that they weren’t making music that sounded like this in the mid-90s. I could be wrong, but in particular the use of decayed samples here seems very much of the moment. \n\nI love everything about this record, starting with the art direction, and on through its warm production, its subtle instrumentation, and the dreamy texture of the vocals. (This is also my headphone album of the year!) I feel like there’s at least one record every year that I say this about, but every moment of *Double Negative* speaks to a band at full command of their powers, masterfully employing every tool at their disposal to get the sound in their heads onto tape. On every listen through, 49 minutes flies by and I’m left wanting to re-experience the whole thing.\n\n### 5. Beacon — *Gravity Pairs*\n\nHere’s a case of first-listen certainty. In fact, arguably, this was a near lock for the list after I had heard only the leading single ‘Be My Organ’, which remains among my favourite tracks of the year. \n\nThis is an electronica of smooth, reflective surfaces, that also makes use of acoustic instrumentation (notably piano) to augment it. Layered on top are subtle vocals that are almost played like an additional instrument rather than being the focal point of any of the tracks. It’s melancholy stuff in places (eg. ‘Bending Light’), but many of the melodies are quite beautiful. The group’s most valuable talent seems to be a sense of exactly when to modulate emotions either within individual tracks, or over the album as a whole. As a result *Gravity Pairs* fits together like a polished crystal - smooth to the touch, but full of fragments and distortions. \n\n###  4. Elohim — *Elohim*\n\nHere’s a slightly confusing situation. You may recall that the number 3 spot on 2016’s list was held by Elohim’s self-titled debut album. At the time she was very much talking about it as her first album, but at some point since has decided it was a 10-track EP. To make matters worse, this year she released what she now considers her debut LP… and gave it the same title. \n\nForget all of that. It makes no difference to the fact that ‘I Want You’ is light and breezy electronic pop of the highest order, ‘F**k Your Money’ is understated and darkly sly, and ‘Panic Attacks’ is an exquisite club anthem with the volume turned waaaaay down. \n\nAs far as I’m concerned, Elohim can make whatever she wants and title it whatever she likes. After these two releases, I’ll be there to find out how it gets weirder.\n\n(PS. I *really* wanted to put this at number 3, just for the symmetry, but…)\n\n###  3. Takeleave — *Inner Sea*\n\nIn a year without an album release from my soul’s resident musician Submerse, to whom am I to turn for premium grade liminal electronica™? This is literally the thought process that found me listening to everything Berlin label Project Mooncircle put out this year. And among a veritable bevy of delights I was relieved and overjoyed to find this from Takeleave. It shifts, it glows, it washes over you in waves timed to your slowing heartbeat. Call it downtempo house, or ambient techno, or broken beats… I don’t mind. This is the sound I need to frequently bathe my brain in, and it was so nice to find someone else making it.\n\n###  2. Anna Burch — *Quit the Curse*\n\nOn her debut record, Anna Burch sounds like the finished article. And she’s bringing along a complex melding of folk, art-rock, indie, and old-fashioned pop hooks. I don’t know how she got surf-adjacent guitar to sit alongside Pavement vocal stylings. Maybe if Ben Kweller and Lana Del Ray covered Surfer Blood, and you played it back at 2/3 speed it would sound like this?  \n\nHowever she’s managing to do it, and make it sound effortless, *Quit The Curse* is a very pretty record with its makeup smudged, wearing the same clothes it wore yesterday. I could listen to it all day. Try ‘2 Cool 2 Care’ and ‘In Your Dreams’ and you’ll either fall head over heels for it, or discover your heart has been hardened against all the world’s beauty.\n\n###  1. AAL (Against All Logic) — *2012-2017*\n\nOK, this is where the fun begins. First of all, don’t be fooled by the artist’s name: this is a new record by Nicolas Jaar, working under one of his many monikers – presumably to avoid being pigeonholed. His previous release, *Sirens* (2016), was one I struggled with leaving off my list for that year. I had no such internal conflict with this one; right from the first time I heard it (in February), I knew that *2012-2017* would make the final cut. \n\nWhere I do need to make special pleading, arguably, is the fact that some of the work here has appeared within continuous mixes that Jaar has done for various outlets over the last couple of years. Many tracks are entirely new, but portions of a few have cropped up before. Nevertheless, this is the first time any of the work has been released in record format, so I’m claiming it. \n\nThis is precisely at the epicentre of one of my favourite electronica subgenres: endlessly exploratory, and happy to bring in influences from all over the musical spectrum to colour its own sound. Opener ‘This Old House Is All I Have’ twists blues into the mix, album highlight ’Know You’ hijacks soul and funk… and so on. But the record’s sound is also miraculously cohesive and quite singular, providing consistent thrills throughout. Some of music’s most thrilling moments of 2018 are contained herein for me, and they’re couched in a shifting bed of melody that I was absolutely entranced by.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\n###  Notable Mentions (aka the next 30, in alphabetical order)\n\n• The Beths – Future Me Hates Me  \n• The Breeders – All Nerve  \n• Cat Power – Wanderer  \n• Chastity – Death Lust  \n• Cosmic Thoughts – Work Night Out  \n• CUTS – A Gradual Decline  \n• Lucy Dacus – Historian   \n• Djrum – Portrait With Firewood   \n• Father John Misty – God’s Favorite Customer   \n• Forth Wanderers – Forth Wanderers   \n• GoGo Penguin – A Humdrum Star  \n• Mass Gothic – I’ve Tortured You Long Enough   \n• Holly Miranda – Mutual Horse   \n• Nas – NASIR   \n• Prefuse 73 – Sacrifices   \n• Profligate – Somewhere Else   \n• Proud Parents – Proud Parents   \n• Rejoicer – Energy Dreams   \n• Rival Consoles – Persona   \n• Robyn – Honey   \n• Caroline Rose – Loner   \n• Jeff Rosenstock – POST–   \n• Ross From Friends – Family Portrait   \n• Superchunk – What A Time To Be Alive  \n• TSVI – Inner Worlds   \n• Tangents – New Bodies  \n• Tanukichan – Sundays  \n• Throwing Snow – Loma   \n• Tirzah – Devotion  \n• ZHU – RINGOS BEACH   \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

Data is routinely made public without consideration as to its utility, and as a direct result users are coached to use the services in ways counter to their own interests.</p>\n<p>Taking Twitter as an example, consider the various things for which the user is presented a numerical value on their own profile: Tweets; Tweets &amp; Replies; Followers; Following; Lists; Likes; Moments; Notifications; Direct Messages. For the most part these are purely informational with respect to one’s own account; only Notifications and Direct Messages may include calls to action. Now consider the categories of information available when viewing another user’s public account: Tweets; Following; Followers; Likes; Lists. Do any of these numbers, as they relate to another person’s account, have any value to you? Let’s take each one in turn:</p>\n<p>• <strong>Tweets</strong>: Reading an account’s public posts is obviously central to how Twitter functions, but there is no need to display a count of how many posts they’ve made overall.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Following</strong>: It may be of interest to you to see which accounts a person follows. I would argue that this should be something that each individual user of Twitter should have the ability to share or keep private. In either case, there is no good reason to display the number of accounts they follow.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Followers</strong>: The same is true here. You might be interested to see who follows an account, but this should be something the account holder chooses whether or not to share. Regardless, there is no need to display the number of followers an account has.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Likes</strong>: I can see no reason to display the number of posts an account holder has liked. As above with Following &amp; Followers, this should be something the account holder can choose to reveal or not. I feel Twitter’s <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html\">introduction of Bookmarks</a> in February 2018 — whilst they certainly have valid alternative uses — was partly a tacit admission that Likes being public isn’t ideal.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Lists</strong>: Compared with the others the number next to Lists is of little consequence, but the reasons why are revealing. Firstly, Lists are an aspect of Twitter over which the user <em>does</em> have complete control with respect to their public / private status. Private Lists do not show on a user’s Profile, and are not included in the count of Lists. Secondly, there is no judgment associated with the number of Lists one maintains.</p>\n<p>This last point brings us to the second part of the argument. Not only does the public nature of these numbers have no <em>positive</em> value, it is often detrimental to the functioning of the service. Social networks are a messy hybrid of communication, publication, and advertising. Nothing good comes of the lines between these functions being blurred or erased, and nothing contributes more to this problem than public metrics. When the count of one’s Tweets, Followers, and Likes is unalterably public, one feels some pressure to keep an eye on the numbers, and quite possibly alter one’s behaviour on the platform (to one degree or another) to change them in the manner one desires to see them change. There is an important distinction here: for example between ‘wanting more followers’ and ‘wanting to <em>be seen</em> to have more followers’. The former may be rooted in a number of motivations, some of them beneficent. The latter is only really attributable to anxiety over reputation, and does no one any good.</p>\n<p>The effect of this is even more detrimental in the case of individual posts. Publicly displaying the number of replies, likes, and retweets that a tweet has received is the single worst element of Twitter. Based on a growing corpus of research (such as that by the <a href=\"https://humanetech.com\">Center for Humane Technology</a>) it is increasingly clear that algorithmically-curated services amplify content with a strong emotional valence. Put simply, a post that elicits strong responses gets interacted with more than a neutral post. More people reply, share, like etc., and as a result the system learns that these posts are more valuable. The next step is that the system makes these posts more visible or prioritises them in other ways, which leads to yet more engagement. This is true of content with a positive emotional valence, but it is particularly the case with negative emotional valences. Nothing travels faster and further, or garners more attention on social networks than outrage.</p>\n<p>And as much as we’d like to pin this entirely on the algorithms, we’re not blameless in the equation. The lesson we’ve learned from using these networks is the same one the algorithms have learned: in order to get more engagement with our posts, we should post more extreme content. If you want a lot of visibility for your posts it’s better to make them confrontational. If you want your opinion to be noticed it’s more effective to inflate it cartoonishly. And the way you receive feedback on whether it’s working or not is by keeping an eye on the numbers. How many replies; how many retweets; how many likes? What should I do differently next time to make those numbers go up?</p>\n<p>Think of this in terms of Instagram, where Likes and Comments are also tabulated publicly. Here the extremes are less likely to be around emotionality, and more commonly to do with beauty or æsthetics. If you post a photo of yourself or your living room decor on a platform where the metrics are publicly viewable, you’re going to naturally be concerned with how it will be received. Not ‘do I like how I look’ but ‘will <em>others</em> like how I look’ in this picture? When the numbers come back and they’re not what you’d hoped for, you naturally make adjustments to how you will present yourself next time.</p>\n<p>This is behaviour modification by way of public score-keeping. It’s one thing that you can see that your selfie only got 6 likes, but it’s infinitely worse that <em>everyone else</em> has that information too. There is no reason that the number of engagements with a post should be publicly viewable. The only thing these metrics track accurately is popularity, and that is the least reliable and most widely misinterpreted guide as to value. That something is popular does not make it good. That something is unpopular does not make it bad. That outrage is more virulent than reason does not make it a better response.</p>\n<p>Imagine the effects of removing these numbers from public display. You can still find out how many people, and whom, liked your post if you so wish, but no one else can. The benefits of altering one’s behaviour or appearance for a future post are entirely removed, as no one will know whether one post is more popular than another. Think of the times that a news report relies on the volume of engagement with a social network post as an indicator of veracity. It’s inaccurate and potentially dangerous to do so, but it’s common practice – such is the ease with which we mistake ‘popular’ for ‘good’ or ‘true’. It’s a problem easily remedied if the metrics are made private.</p>\n<p>These numbers might mean something to you as a user. It bears asking yourself <em>what</em> they mean to you and <em>why</em>. How much of it is because other people see them too? Do you look to the numbers displayed on other people’s accounts and posts as indicators of anything other than popularity?

				"content_html": "<p>Recently I got to try something I’ve been intrigued by for some time: sensory deprivation. I don’t remember where I first learned about the idea, but since I became aware of it I’ve seen it pitched as the centre of a Venn diagram between spa treatment and mindfulness experience. The core principle is simply to remove as much external stimulus as possible. That means absolute darkness, near silence, and weightless suspension in water heated to your body temperature, such that gravity and touch are counterbalanced.</p>\n<p>In a private room, the first step is to take a quick shower whilst the pod finishes its cleaning cycle. Whilst it’s doing this the water bubbles gently and is lit pink by an underwater LED. I felt a little apprehensive about the whole thing at this point, simply because it’s so unlike anything else I’ve done. I would class myself as an experienced novice at meditation. It has been a while since I maintained a regular practice, but I probably have a few hundred hours’ of zazen over the course of two decades. In theory the state inside the tank is one that you seek during meditation: a still place in which to be alone with the breath. But any meditator will tell you that it’s not <em>external</em> stimuli, but the mind, that presents the most persistent obstacle – and I was due to take my mind in with me.</p>\n<p>My entry into the tank was graceless. Not only are the surfaces plastic, and as such kind of slippy like the average bathtub, but the water fights you immediately. The 300kg of magnesium sulfate dissolved in the 1,000L of water means you float like a rubber duck. Whilst bobbing around, trying to reach up behind me to pull the lid of the tank down, I felt as ridiculous as I likely looked.</p>\n<p>Once that was out of the way, I had a few moments to try and settle in. The pink light remained on in the pod, and the water continued to bubble gently around me. I considered and then rejected the earplugs that had been provided, and made several attempts to find a comfortable position for my arms. In the end I opted to have my hands resting underneath my head. And no sooner had I got that figured out, than the light and the pump shut off. Absolute darkness. Darkness that felt like it had a weight and texture. And complete silence unless I actively made a sound. I’ll admit that the nullification of my senses freaked me out at first. Understanding intellectually what the experience entails, and going into it, are two very different things. A couple of times, just to check I hadn’t entirely disappeared from existence, I moved my foot to splash some water, or stretched out and heard my back crack. Otherwise all I could hear was the beat of my heart.</p>\n<p>For a little over an hour I floated; just me, in an enclosed pod about the size of a single bed. I found that, just like meditation when you’re not in the habit, the trickiest part was remembering that there was nothing to do – nothing I <em>should</em> be doing. I, at least, am so accustomed to asking myself whether I’m doing any given task ‘correctly’ or ‘well’ that it becomes reflexive for those questions to arise consistently in my subconscious. Several times throughout the hour I caught myself wondering whether I was floating as I ‘should’ be, or if I was having the ‘right’ thoughts during the experience. In meditation you learn that the mind thinks like the lungs breathe and the heart beats – it happens naturally and it’s not something you can stop; the key is in how you direct you attention. I found floating to be a similar experience.</p>\n<p>I had heard beforehand that to many people the hour doesn’t feel like an hour. I didn’t sleep, as some people choose to do, but I did have the experience that the time seemed to pass quite quickly. I have certainly sat half hour sessions of zazen, with a sore lower back and numbing butt, that felt <em>a lot</em> longer. My uneducated guess is that this has something to do with how the mind processes time: that devoid of external stimulus your ability to approximate duration becomes increasingly inexact. When the water began to bubble gently, and then the pink light came on, I climbed (gracelessly) out of the pod. Momentarily it was odd to feel the weight of my own limbs again, and under my feet the grit of a little epsomite that dusted the floor. I showered once more, rinsing the salts off my skin and out of my hair, dressed, and made my way back out of the spa to surprisingly bright sunlight.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the day I felt calm, and more comfortable than normal moving at a slower pace, both physically and mentally. Restful, is probably the most appropriate word I can use. I was glad I didn’t have anything else planned for the day, as it meant I could just enjoy the feeling until I headed to bed a little earlier than usual.</p>\n<p>It’s something that I’d like to repeat, I think. If for no other reason than to bypass the initial stage of apprehension at the unfamiliar, lessen the period needed for adjustment, and be able to settle in more quickly to the experience itself. I’d also encourage you to try it if it’s something you’re half curious about. As strange a way as it might seem to sign off an eight paragraph description of an experience, it’s kind of indescribable.</p>\n",

Whilst bobbing around, trying to reach up behind me to pull the lid of the tank down, I felt as ridiculous as I likely looked. \n\nOnce that was out of the way, I had a few moments to try and settle in. The pink light remained on in the pod, and the water continued to bubble gently around me. I considered and then rejected the earplugs that had been provided, and made several attempts to find a comfortable position for my arms. In the end I opted to have my hands resting underneath my head. And no sooner had I got that figured out, than the light and the pump shut off. Absolute darkness. Darkness that felt like it had a weight and texture. And complete silence unless I actively made a sound. I’ll admit that the nullification of my senses freaked me out at first. Understanding intellectually what the experience entails, and going into it, are two very different things. A couple of times, just to check I hadn’t entirely disappeared from existence, I moved my foot to splash some water, or stretched out and heard my back crack. Otherwise all I could hear was the beat of my heart.\n\nFor a little over an hour I floated; just me, in an enclosed pod about the size of a single bed. I found that, just like meditation when you’re not in the habit, the trickiest part was remembering that there was nothing to do – nothing I *should* be doing. I, at least, am so accustomed to asking myself whether I’m doing any given task ‘correctly’ or ‘well’ that it becomes reflexive for those questions to arise consistently in my subconscious. Several times throughout the hour I caught myself wondering whether I was floating as I ‘should’ be, or if I was having the ‘right’ thoughts during the experience. In meditation you learn that the mind thinks like the lungs breathe and the heart beats – it happens naturally and it’s not something you can stop; the key is in how you direct you attention. I found floating to be a similar experience. \n\nI had heard beforehand that to many people the hour doesn’t feel like an hour. I didn’t sleep, as some people choose to do, but I did have the experience that the time seemed to pass quite quickly. I have certainly sat half hour sessions of zazen, with a sore lower back and numbing butt, that felt *a lot* longer. My uneducated guess is that this has something to do with how the mind processes time: that devoid of external stimulus your ability to approximate duration becomes increasingly inexact. When the water began to bubble gently, and then the pink light came on, I climbed (gracelessly) out of the pod. Momentarily it was odd to feel the weight of my own limbs again, and under my feet the grit of a little epsomite that dusted the floor. I showered once more, rinsing the salts off my skin and out of my hair, dressed, and made my way back out of the spa to surprisingly bright sunlight. \n\nFor the remainder of the day I felt calm, and more comfortable than normal moving at a slower pace, both physically and mentally. Restful, is probably the most appropriate word I can use. I was glad I didn’t have anything else planned for the day, as it meant I could just enjoy the feeling until I headed to bed a little earlier than usual. \n\nIt’s something that I’d like to repeat, I think. If for no other reason than to bypass the initial stage of apprehension at the unfamiliar, lessen the period needed for adjustment, and be able to settle in more quickly to the experience itself. I’d also encourage you to try it if it’s something you’re half curious about. As strange a way as it might seem to sign off an eight paragraph description of an experience, it’s kind of indescribable. \n",

So, out of nothing more than sheer curiosity, I requested everything they have on me. Excavating the folder that came back has been super-interesting. Here are a few select pieces of what’s included.</p>\n<p>• Every Apple device ever associated with my account, and every firmware version that has ever been installed on each.</p>\n<p>• Every email address, physical address, and payment option ever associated with my account.</p>\n<p>• Every device from which I have ever logged into my account. This included items like ‘RIVERSIDE22’: my work PC at a job I had in 2009, and listings such as ‘Mendicant Bias’ and ‘Penitent Tangent’ from when I used to name my machines using embarrassingly nerdy references (2011).</p>\n<p>• Predictably, every purchase I have ever made from iTunes, starting with my first: ‘Kiss Me’ by Sixpence None the Richer on 5 Aug 2005.</p>\n<p>• Also, every free item I’ve downloaded from an Apple digital store.</p>\n<p>• Every song and album I’ve played on MUSIC; how many times I’ve listened to it; when I first played it, and when I last played it.</p>\n<p>• A complete catalogue of every song or album I have expressed a binary opinion about on MUSIC.</p>\n<p>• Hilariously, a subfolder containing a separate document that simply lists the tracks from the U2 album <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, which Apple infamously forced upon everybody with an internet connected iOS device in 2014, and which the majority of us deleted instantly.</p>\n<p>• Every item for which I have engaged in the dubious practice of pre-ordering a digital good.</p>\n<p>• Every item I’ve ever watched on my TV, including a timestamp of where I left off. (A playcount is also included, revealing my worrying <em>Mr Robot</em> viewing habits.)</p>\n<p>• A <em>colossal</em> spreadsheet listing every episode of every podcast I have ever listened to, the date I listened to it, a timestamp of where I left off, and whether or not I am subscribed to the podcast in question.</p>\n<p>• A list of all my iBooks purchases, alongside separate documents that mark the position I’ve reached in each book, any highlighting I’ve done, and any annotations that I’ve added.</p>\n<p>• Every review I’ve left for an item in an Apple digital store, including the rating out of 5 and any comments I made.</p>\n<p>• Every time I’ve complained about another customer’s review of a product in an Apple digital store!</p>\n<p>• Every app I’ve beta tested via Apple’s Testflight.</p>\n<p>• Every store item I’ve ever gifted, and every gift card I’ve ever redeemed (including date of redemption and value).</p>\n<p>• PDF copies of all of the email receipts sent to me following in-person purchases at an Apple retail store. These go back to the time I bought a blue ‘bumper’ for my iPhone 4 in June 2013.</p>\n<p>• Every product for which I’ve taken out AppleCare+.</p>\n<p>• Every interaction I’ve had with AppleCare support.</p>\n<p>• The transcript of every chat I’ve had with AppleCare support. Interestingly these also include the text of chats between Apple employees relating to the support ticket.</p>\n<p>• All of my responses to surveys regarding my customer service experiences.</p>\n<p>• All of my earned achievements and leaderboard positions for GameCenter enabled iOS games.</p>\n<p>• Safari browsing history and bookmarks are empty folders in my case (because I routinely purge them), but they’re in there.</p>\n<p>• Details of recent FaceTime calls and message recipients are also blank in my case because I have a habit of erasing the histories every week. But, it would all otherwise be there.</p>\n<p>• Map locations I’ve marked as favourites.</p>\n<p>• Copies of all iCloud calendars and Reminder lists (both as .ics files).</p>\n<p>• Copies of all my iCloud contacts as vCards.</p>\n<p>• Plaintext copies of all items kept in iCloud folders in Notes, with rich media attachments in separate folders. Also, a list of any shared notes, with whom they are shared, and the applicable permission structure.</p>\n<p>• Every correction I’ve submitted to the Apple Maps team, including screenshots.</p>\n<p>• An .xml file of every wifi network I’ve connected to and chosen to remember the login credentials for.</p>\n<p>• Finally, in a folder named ‘Other Data’, an absolutely colossal spreadsheet listing every action involving my iCloud storage. It’s a chronological list of every photo / video I’ve uploaded to iCloud, and every time it’s been downloaded on another device; every time I’ve deleted a file from iCloud storage; every time I’ve recovered a recently deleted file; every time I’ve uploaded, downloaded, and deleted a photo from my Photo Stream; every interaction I’ve had with photos / videos in a shared album; every document added to iCloud Drive, and every time I’ve modified one or deleted one; every time I’ve applied a tag to a file in iCloud Drive; every time I’ve enabled or disabled an app to work with iCloud Drive… basically any time anything I’ve done has touched my iCloud storage. Interestingly it’s named ‘iCloudUsageData Set1.csv’ and contains entries only for the last couple of months (it’s still thousands and thousands of rows).</p>\n<p>Awe is not something one expects to feel when looking at a series of spreadsheets, but I’m in awe of the engineering it must take to build a system like this. Notably absent from this trove of data is the more personal stuff. I’m an Watch user, and none of the data around my heart rate, exercise habits etc. is here. I also use the Health app and Medical ID on iPhone, and so those apps have information on my weight, blood type, medical history etc. That data is also not included here. Apple has made clear from the launch of those products that user privacy is paramount, and (outside of your devices) that data is only contained in backups the user creates locally <em>and chooses to have encrypted</em>. Similarly the text of iMessage chats is not part of the data that Apple keeps; those are encrypted end-to-end and unreadable by anyone but the sender and recipient, including Apple.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth thinking for a moment about why Apple keeps the data that it does. In the vast majority of cases it is kept in order to improve the user’s experience. If I download a film or a podcast episode to a new device and it picks up where I last stopped playing it, I don’t think about the giant spreadsheet that made that possible – I’m just delighted that it works that way. All of the ratings I’ve given items on MUSIC are used to generate custom playlists more to my liking. And, don’t forget the small miracle of logging into a brand new device with one’s AppleID and having all of one’s data available effortlessly: contacts, calendars, notes, music, photos etc. etc. etc. Depending on your age you might recall the stressful, laborious processes involved in transferring all of this stuff before the ubiquity of the cloud.</p>\n<p>In short, there’s nothing here that I disagree with Apple retaining. And a large part of that is because I know it is not part of Apple’s business model to leverage this data for their own gain. The data that Facebook and Google retain on you is certainly used to improve your experience with their products, but it is also used to enable their business models, which are reliant almost exclusively on advertising. Despite its growing array of products (digital and physical) <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266471/distribution-of-googles-revenues-by-source/\">86% of Google’s revenue still comes from advertisers</a>. In Facebook’s case <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/267031/facebooks-annual-revenue-by-segment/\">the figure is 98%</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most striking omission is the fact that there is no record of purchases I’ve made using Pay. Such data points would likely be too potentially rich a seam of information for an advertiser-dependent company to resist collecting, speaking directly as it would to my purchasing habits, preferred brands, and so on.</p>\n",

So, out of nothing more than sheer curiosity, I requested everything they have on me. Excavating the folder that came back has been super-interesting. Here are a few select pieces of what’s included. \n\n• Every Apple device ever associated with my account, and every firmware version that has ever been installed on each. \n\n• Every email address, physical address, and payment option ever associated with my account. \n\n• Every device from which I have ever logged into my account. This included items like ‘RIVERSIDE22’: my work PC at a job I had in 2009, and listings such as ‘Mendicant Bias’ and ‘Penitent Tangent’ from when I used to name my machines using embarrassingly nerdy references (2011).\n\n• Predictably, every purchase I have ever made from iTunes, starting with my first: ‘Kiss Me’ by Sixpence None the Richer on 5 Aug 2005.\n\n• Also, every free item I’ve downloaded from an Apple digital store.\n\n• Every song and album I’ve played on MUSIC; how many times I’ve listened to it; when I first played it, and when I last played it. \n\n• A complete catalogue of every song or album I have expressed a binary opinion about on MUSIC.\n\n• Hilariously, a subfolder containing a separate document that simply lists the tracks from the U2 album *Songs of Innocence*, which Apple infamously forced upon everybody with an internet connected iOS device in 2014, and which the majority of us deleted instantly.\n\n• Every item for which I have engaged in the dubious practice of pre-ordering a digital good.\n\n• Every item I’ve ever watched on my TV, including a timestamp of where I left off. (A playcount is also included, revealing my worrying *Mr Robot* viewing habits.)\n\n• A *colossal* spreadsheet listing every episode of every podcast I have ever listened to, the date I listened to it, a timestamp of where I left off, and whether or not I am subscribed to the podcast in question.\n\n• A list of all my iBooks purchases, alongside separate documents that mark the position I’ve reached in each book, any highlighting I’ve done, and any annotations that I’ve added. \n\n• Every review I’ve left for an item in an Apple digital store, including the rating out of 5 and any comments I made.\n\n• Every time I’ve complained about another customer’s review of a product in an Apple digital store!\n\n• Every app I’ve beta tested via Apple’s Testflight. \n\n• Every store item I’ve ever gifted, and every gift card I’ve ever redeemed (including date of redemption and value).\n\n• PDF copies of all of the email receipts sent to me following in-person purchases at an Apple retail store. These go back to the time I bought a blue ‘bumper’ for my iPhone 4 in June 2013. \n\n• Every product for which I’ve taken out AppleCare+. \n\n• Every interaction I’ve had with AppleCare support.\n\n• The transcript of every chat I’ve had with AppleCare support. Interestingly these also include the text of chats between Apple employees relating to the support ticket.\n\n• All of my responses to surveys regarding my customer service experiences.\n\n• All of my earned achievements and leaderboard positions for GameCenter enabled iOS games.\n\n• Safari browsing history and bookmarks are empty folders in my case (because I routinely purge them), but they’re in there.\n\n• Details of recent FaceTime calls and message recipients are also blank in my case because I have a habit of erasing the histories every week. But, it would all otherwise be there.\n\n• Map locations I’ve marked as favourites. \n\n• Copies of all iCloud calendars and Reminder lists (both as .ics files).\n\n• Copies of all my iCloud contacts as vCards.\n\n• Plaintext copies of all items kept in iCloud folders in Notes, with rich media attachments in separate folders. Also, a list of any shared notes, with whom they are shared, and the applicable permission structure. \n\n• Every correction I’ve submitted to the Apple Maps team, including screenshots.\n\n• An .xml file of every wifi network I’ve connected to and chosen to remember the login credentials for.\n\n• Finally, in a folder named ‘Other Data’, an absolutely colossal spreadsheet listing every action involving my iCloud storage. It’s a chronological list of every photo / video I’ve uploaded to iCloud, and every time it’s been downloaded on another device; every time I’ve deleted a file from iCloud storage; every time I’ve recovered a recently deleted file; every time I’ve uploaded, downloaded, and deleted a photo from my Photo Stream; every interaction I’ve had with photos / videos in a shared album; every document added to iCloud Drive, and every time I’ve modified one or deleted one; every time I’ve applied a tag to a file in iCloud Drive; every time I’ve enabled or disabled an app to work with iCloud Drive… basically any time anything I’ve done has touched my iCloud storage. Interestingly it’s named ‘iCloudUsageData Set1.csv’ and contains entries only for the last couple of months (it’s still thousands and thousands of rows). \n\nAwe is not something one expects to feel when looking at a series of spreadsheets, but I’m in awe of the engineering it must take to build a system like this. Notably absent from this trove of data is the more personal stuff. I’m an Watch user, and none of the data around my heart rate, exercise habits etc. is here. I also use the Health app and Medical ID on iPhone, and so those apps have information on my weight, blood type, medical history etc. That data is also not included here. Apple has made clear from the launch of those products that user privacy is paramount, and (outside of your devices) that data is only contained in backups the user creates locally *and chooses to have encrypted*. Similarly the text of iMessage chats is not part of the data that Apple keeps; those are encrypted end-to-end and unreadable by anyone but the sender and recipient, including Apple. \n\nIt’s also worth thinking for a moment about why Apple keeps the data that it does. In the vast majority of cases it is kept in order to improve the user’s experience. If I download a film or a podcast episode to a new device and it picks up where I last stopped playing it, I don’t think about the giant spreadsheet that made that possible – I’m just delighted that it works that way. All of the ratings I’ve given items on MUSIC are used to generate custom playlists more to my liking. And, don’t forget the small miracle of logging into a brand new device with one’s AppleID and having all of one’s data available effortlessly: contacts, calendars, notes, music, photos etc. etc. etc. Depending on your age you might recall the stressful, laborious processes involved in transferring all of this stuff before the ubiquity of the cloud. \n\nIn short, there’s nothing here that I disagree with Apple retaining. And a large part of that is because I know it is not part of Apple’s business model to leverage this data for their own gain. The data that Facebook and Google retain on you is certainly used to improve your experience with their products, but it is also used to enable their business models, which are reliant almost exclusively on advertising. Despite its growing array of products (digital and physical) [86% of Google’s revenue still comes from advertisers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266471/distribution-of-googles-revenues-by-source/). In Facebook’s case [the figure is 98%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267031/facebooks-annual-revenue-by-segment/).\n\nPerhaps the most striking omission is the fact that there is no record of purchases I’ve made using Pay. Such data points would likely be too potentially rich a seam of information for an advertiser-dependent company to resist collecting, speaking directly as it would to my purchasing habits, preferred brands, and so on.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-3\">20. Run The Jewels — <em>Run the Jewels 3</em></h3>\n<p>As I write this Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Damn</em> is topping year-end lists left and right and I’m wondering what I missed on an album I just didn’t connect with. Of the hip-hop that passed through my headphones this year I had a good time with Vince Staples’s <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, really liked Open Mike Eagle’s <em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em> (but spent too little time with it), and bounced off most of the big hitters to one degree or another: as well as <em>Damn</em>, Jay-Z’s lukewarm <em>4:44</em> and Drake’s <em>More Life</em> did little for me, and I’ve never clicked with the Migos thing.</p>\n<p>That leaves room for only one rap record on this year’s list, but it’s a doozy. RTJ remain a complete enigma to me: I don’t know how they came together, I don’t know why they give every record away instead of selling them, and I don’t know why their combo of braggadocio, political engagement, and downright silliness works (this is a mix that only seems to work in hip-hop, with Beastie Boys as perhaps the flag-bearers) – I’m just grateful for it all.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Legend Has It’ is one of my most quoted songs of the year (for better or worse). It’s just the right mix of all the magic elements that make RTJ special. The moment when El P’s girlfriend interrupts to stop him completing one particularly crude line makes me smile, if not laugh, every time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-portico-quartet--art-in-the-age-of-automation\">19. Portico Quartet — <em>Art in the Age of Automation</em></h3>\n<p>There were three records this year that I returned to time and again for a dose of calm, reflective ambience: one didn’t quite make the list (Andrew Bird’s <em>Echolocations: River</em>), one is further up this list, and the latest from Portico Quartet is the third.\nOnce again a four-piece following the departure of founding member Nick Mulvey and one record as a trio (renamed, simply Portico), <em>AitAoA</em> finds the band taking another progressive step with their sound. When they took 8th spot on my list in 2012 (with their eponymous LP), I ended my write-up by saying I was excited to see what was next. Actually, 2015’s <em>Living Fields</em> didn’t quite chime for me – essentially an electronica album, with some guest vocals I could live without, it felt like a band deliberately trying to make a clean break with the past, and ignoring their strengths to do so. This year’s record (following the addition to the roster of Kier Vine) feels like a very deliberate further sonic evolution, which brings back the more organic instrumentation and cuts the vocals. It’s precisely what I wanted from the follow up to Portico Quartet, and perhaps their strongest album to date.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Current History’ takes as its base an effervescent, <em>Amnesiac</em>-style percussion pattern and layers tones and loops on top.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-death-from-above--outrage-is-now\">18. Death From Above — <em>Outrage! Is Now</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s something I wrote when DFA’s <em>The Physical World</em> took top spot in my list for 2014:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power is a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who knows what kind of albums this band could have made in the decade-long interval between their studio debut and its follow-up? Perhaps it took that time, and the up &amp; down intra-bandmate relationship, to make that second record. Whatever the case, I’m glad we didn’t have to wait so long for a third LP.</p>\n<p>Sebastien Grainger is a great drummer and Jesse F. Keeler is a great bassist; both have a great ear for infectious hooks, and they share a willingness to push their compositions as far as they’ll go: harder, faster, heavier, groovier. Perhaps the least talked about weapon in the band’s arsenal is Grainger’s voice; it’s a passionate, vaulting, wonderfully tuneful thing that serves as a solid third pillar in their song-craft.</p>\n<p><em>Outrage! Is Now</em> sounds like DFA. It sounds like someone lent them a couple of synths, but it’s unmistakably the same racket they made on the previous records. And man does it still get me!?</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Nvr 4Evr’ is classic DFA; the kind of track that bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club wish they’d written.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-beck--colors\">17. Beck — <em>Colors</em></h3>\n<p>Do you remember that part in <em>Superman Returns</em> where Lex Luther explains to Kitty Kowalski that crystals take on the properties of the elements that surround them? I feel that Beck operates in a similar fashion: whatever given sound or vibe he turns his attention to, he’s able to produce music that feels authentic. Sometimes it’s meditative (eg. <em>Sea Change</em> (2002)), sometimes a little sombre (eg. <em>Morning Phase</em> (2014)), and sometimes poppy and easygoing (eg. <em>Odelay</em> (1996) &amp; <em>Guero</em> (2005)). And no matter which category he’s playing in, Beck’s consistently doing something interesting with it. Whether it’s Brazilian influences on <em>Guero</em>, or the hip-hop touches to <em>The Information</em> (2006), Beck is a restlessly inventive artist in the same mould as Madonna or Björk (perhaps it’s something to do with the mononyms?).\n<em>Colors</em> is Beck in full-on pop assault mode. And he’s happy to pull from anywhere and everywhere to make it happen. Shamelessly detuned guitars and anthemic choruses; jaunty Beatles-esque piano; ’No Distraction’ sounds like Sting collaborating with The Killers.\nIn sum it’s the same trick that Daniel Johns et al managed to pull off with <em>Young Modern</em> (2007): the making of a pop album on one’s own artistic terms. It’s not quite as strange (or as sublime) as that Silverchair record, but both are unmistakably the work of diversely-talented musicians making a direct assault on whatever part of the brain responds to catchy pop music.</p>\n<p>Highlight: The panpipe melody that runs through title track ‘Colors’ – anything that can make me love the sound of an instrument I previously hated has to be doing something right.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-the-xx--i-see-you\">16. The xx — <em>I See You</em></h3>\n<p>To my ears the third album from The xx sounds like a natural progression of a sound that started off very simple and somewhat reserved, and has blossomed into a form somewhat brighter, self-assured, and colourful. It’s only natural, in fact, that the band’s third album as a trio takes notes from <em>In Colour</em>, Jamie xx’s vibrant, dance-floor friendly solo album of 2015 (#8 on that year’s List). The blaring horns that start the record were called out by several reviewers as a shock departure for The xx’s sound; but the shock was far less if you’d allowed Jamie’s solo LP to work its magic on you a couple of years previously.</p>\n<p>All of which is not to say that <em>I See You</em> sounds entirely different from its predecessors. The heart of the record is still the haunted, sleek blend of trip-hop and the lighter side of the EDM spectrum. And the songwriting is still coming from somewhere intensely personal. It’s not necessary to know about the friction between bandmates that sits behind tracks like ‘Say Something Loving’, and ‘Test Me’ in order to feel that these are songs crafted by people who felt them intensely.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘On Hold’ seemed a bit divisive when it was released ahead of the album, as it calls out the departures that The xx’s sound was taking on the record. Some reacted with shock or disappointment, but I was onboard immediately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-submerse--are-you-anywhere\">15. Submerse — <em>Are You Anywhere</em></h3>\n<p>For my money <em>Are You Anywhere</em> represents as strong a set of tracks as Submerse has released since I’ve been listening to him, starting with <em>Slow Waves</em> – which was my number 5 album of 2014. (<em>Stay Home</em> just missed out on a spot in 2015, and in 2016 he grabbed 13th for <em>Awake</em>.) Both the mix of organic &amp; electronic elements, and the dazed-sounding production, are familiar from previous albums, and the spell that’s cast here is just as effective on me as ever.</p>\n<p>In four albums and a couple of EPs over the last four years Submerse hasn’t really made much of a departure from his core sound. However, it’s a sound that I can’t get enough of, and my only complaint here is that 31 minutes is too short a time to spend in this sonic space.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Too Many Sidequests’ makes use of Submerse’s knack for incorporating video game sound effects into alien soundscapes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-inheaven--inheaven\">14. INHEAVEN — <em>INHEAVEN</em></h3>\n<p>What happened to The Subways? Wikipedia says they’re still extant, but nothing’s been released in 5 years, and I don’t remember hearing anything in nearly a decade. Anyway: INHEAVEN have made a pretty great record in the same mould, with perhaps a bit more Pixies influence (hence the name, I guess), and a bit more lightness in its step. It’s loud, it’s brash, and it’s unashamedly fun more-or-less from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Songs like ‘Treats’ &amp; ‘Vulture’ are designed for chanting along to, and I can’t listen to them without imagining what they would do to the front half of Brixton Academy. But this is a band that does have at least one gear above ‘simple crowd-pleasing stomper’ and it’s telling that several of the tracks here very quickly feel as though you’ve known them for a long time.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Stupid Things’ is half sickly-sweet pop song and half tender-hearted confession.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-toro-y-moi--boo-boo\">13. Toro y Moi — <em>Boo Boo</em></h3>\n<p>Chaz Bear took fourth spot in 2015 with <em>What For?</em>, and it’s largely the same formula of dreamy tones, soft beats, and lightly-treated vocals that has him back on the list this time. ‘Mirage’ kicks off the album as it means to go on, and when it pauses three minutes in for Chaz to intone “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there”, I 100% believe that this music is just the soundtrack to his life, and we’re just showing up to peep in for another 50 minute dose.</p>\n<p>The sound palate that <em>Boo Boo</em> shares with <em>What For?</em> is pretty singular – it’s identifiable within a couple of bars as TyM – and, as such, it’s likely to be a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Personally I find the relaxed, pastel-infused vibes on these records to be borderline medicinal.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Girl Like You’ sounds like an 80s chart pop song (which I absolutely do not intend as a pejorative) fed through Chaz’s particular filter, and it comes out sounding no less sweet but perhaps a bit more interesting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-charly-bliss--guppy\">12. Charly Bliss — <em>Guppy</em></h3>\n<p>Remember that dog. (mandatory lower case and full stop) – 90s grunge-influenced, optimismcore / original recipe emo LA outfit who released at least one and maybe two masterpieces on Geffen? There’s still a part of me that identifies strongly with late 90s cartoon misanthrope Daria, and in that guise I love both that dog. and, now, Charly Bliss. They’re from the other coast, and they’re 20 years late, but there’s no doubting they’re playing from the heart, and maybe that’s all you need to rekindle an old sound. It certainly worked on me instantly; there are guitar sounds on this record I haven’t heard since <em>Pinkerton</em> and, turns out, I’ve been missing them dearly.</p>\n<p>Infectious; exuberant; wilfully, naively upbeat… I need more of this sound in my life. There’s not much depth to what’s on offer here, but there doesn’t have to be. At least for a couple of records let’s just close our eyes and pretend it’s a couple of decades ago.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Ruby’ just might be my favourite song of the year. Pixies bass, vintage Weezer guitar, and one of the album’s best lilting, acrobatic vocals. If you’ll forgive the pun, it’s kind of blissful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-shigeto--the-new-monday\">11. Shigeto — <em>The New Monday</em></h3>\n<p>When I grow up I want to be Jason Heyward, five-time Gold Glove winner and flawless right-fielder for the Chicago Cubs. One of the many problems with that is that Heyward is eight years younger than me. So my second choice is Zachary Shigeto Saginaw. (I’m pretty sure Shigeto is also younger than me, but I don’t know that for a fact!)</p>\n<p>My first Shigeto record was <em>No Better Time Than Now</em>, 17th spot on this list for 2013, and I’ve been captivated ever since by his particular blend of electronica, hip-hop, and jazz. He’s endlessly inventive, effortlessly cool, and seemingly always able to capture a new sound or put a new spin on an old one. He’s also a ridiculous drummer. (I highly recommend watching some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DduNRXh3h3o\">videos of his live performances</a>.)</p>\n<p><em>The New Monday</em> is right up there with <em>No Better Time…</em> for me. I’m still listening to the earlier record, and I have no trouble believing I’ll still be playing this in five years.</p>\n<p>Highlight: Opener ‘Detroit Pt II’ is an evolution of one of <em>No Better Time Than Now’s</em> strongest tracks: ‘Detroit Pt I’.</p>\n<p>(Side note: Shigeto isn’t flawless. He put out another record this year as a duo with vocalist ZelooperZ, as ZGTO. I did not get on with that album at all! Still, even Jason Heyward drops a ball now and then.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-paramore--after-laughter\">10. Paramore — <em>After Laughter</em></h3>\n<p>On 2013’s list I excused Paramore’s inclusion at number 12 by joking that I am, in fact, a 15-year old girl. Quite why one tends to feel some form of guilt or shame for liking certain things, I don’t know. So in that spirit, though I might like to make another joke, I have to hold my hand up now and say that this band makes really good pop-rock albums, and I love them without reservation.</p>\n<p>There is likely nothing here to win over new fans. But, that said, there are some new departures in terms of sound. Overall the instrumentation feels more heavily weighted to electronic drums and synths where it would have been more uniformly guitars previously. Several of the tracks have a synthy, 80s vibe to them, telegraphed upfront by the Kraftwerk outro to opener ‘Hard Times’. Hayley Williams’s voice remains the group’s distinguishing factor, and is in fine form throughout here: by turns angry, soothing, empowered &amp; empowering, and never less than note-perfect.</p>\n<p>More of this please. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Fake Happy’ begins as an acoustic sketch and blossoms into a Cyndi Lauper-esque stomper straight from the heart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-arcade-fire--everything-now\">9. Arcade Fire — <em>Everything Now</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know how they do it, but every time a new Arcade Fire album comes out I go through a period of disappointment, which lasts a few listens, before ultimately it wins me over completely and captures top spot on my year-end list. Well, everything except the final part of that process happened this time around also.</p>\n<p>I think there’s something about AF’s music that has this polarising effect on listeners. Spin called <em>Everything Now</em> “deeply cynical” and “joyless”; Pitchfork termed it “pale” and “joyless”, and yet I honestly don’t know what they’re hearing that I’m not, or what I’m hearing that they’re not. There are at least three tracks here that rank among the most musically euphoric the band have ever recorded. Which is maybe why just as many reviewers gave opinions similar to that of Slant, who thought <em>Everything Now</em> “by far Arcade Fire&rsquo;s most upbeat… album to date”.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to disagree on the quality of an album, but in my experience this level of disparity on something like a record’s tone is very unusual. Maybe this is a band that makes emotionally confusing music, that takes the listener a while to catch up to.\nIn short, this is still a band without a bad song in their catalogue. ‘Everything Now’, ‘Creature Comfort’, and ‘Put Your Money on Me’ are some of the best songs they’ve recorded, and yet this is their weakest album as a whole. After <em>White Blood Cells</em> and <em>Elephant</em> sometimes there’s an <em>Icky Thump</em>; after <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em> you’re allowed to make <em>The King of Limbs</em>. In both cases, as here, those are very strong records outshone by all their siblings.</p>\n<p>Highlight: The slow build of the ABBA-indebted ‘Put Your Money on Me’ is masterly. How something can sound simultaneously sad and like an 80s disco classic is… confusing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-lusine--sensorimotor\">8. Lusine — <em>Sensorimotor</em></h3>\n<p>Back in March I was taking an early morning flight to the UK. It was due to depart Iceland at just after 06:00, which meant arriving at the airport sometime around 04:00; and to get to the airport there’s a ~45 minute coach ride from Reykjavik. That’s too early to pay attention to a podcast, or to concentrate on a book under some tiny, ineffective reading light. So I pressed play on a record I’d added to my library simply because I add everything that Ghostly International release to my library. It seems probable to me that <em>Sensorimotor</em> will always remind me of that drive out to the airport in the early morning dark. That’s just what the album sounds like to me now.\nThe backbone of the record is a collection of bass beats and superior electronic sweeps. Out of which are composed a series of haunted sonic landscapes that feel monochromatic and restless, like a brain roused too early from sleep it would prefer to return to.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Slow Motion’ is a bundle of nervous energy laid over a kick that sounds like a skipping heartbeat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-four-tet--new-energy\">7. Four Tet — <em>New Energy</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve been listening to Four Tet now for a little less than 15 years. In that time there have been some notable shifts in focus for the music that Kieran Hebden is creating. <em>Rounds</em> (2003) was the record that kicked off my interest, and is still held as the epitome of a certain (now possibly extinct?) sub-sub-genre somewhat awkwardly termed &lsquo;folktronica&rsquo;. <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> (2005) was vibrant and urgent, and in some ways presaged the shift that followed it. <em>There is Love in You</em> (2010) &amp; <em>Pink</em> (2012) felt more like collections of tracks designed for the dance-floor. Not that they weren’t enjoyable coming through headphones or home speakers, just that the records themselves felt a little less cohesive even if they still retained the power to excite and move. This period was capped off with <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> (2013), which felt like the culmination of that particular sound for Hebden. The bifurcated nature of the EP <em>Morning / Evening</em> (2015) was a leading sign of the next shift that Four Tet’s music would take.</p>\n<p>To me, even on first listen, <em>New Energy</em> feels like that latest sound’s full arrival. Unmistakably there are call-backs to what has come before – in fact the sound might best be thought of as a seamless amalgamation of everything Four Tet has released to this point. And that’s some feat. This is a complex, multi-layered work that bears repeated listening, but which engages the listener on a very human level. Warm, open, and never less than a joy to listen to.</p>\n<p>Highlight: Tough to pick one, but right now the steady, hypnotic ebb of ‘Daughter’ is my favourite. That will change tomorrow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-st-vincent--masseduction\">6. St. Vincent — <em>MASSEDUCTION</em></h3>\n<p>Annie Clark nabbed second spot in 2014 with her previous, eponymous album; I’ve been waiting impatiently ever since to find out what would come next. The answer, it seems, is another very fine collection of postmodern agit-pop that contains more ideas in each song than many bands have on a record.</p>\n<p>For me, there’s no ‘Digital Witness’ here, and perhaps not quite a ‘Birth in Reverse’, but this is one of those cases where comparison purely to the artist’s own catalogue gives a misleading picture. Simply put: not many musicians are making music like Annie Clark. Maybe it feels particularly acute in the post-Bowie / post-Prince world, but I find myself at pains to find and applaud this kind of brave, soul-searching, uncomfortable artistry. St. Vincent is an artist working in rarified air, way up there on the art-rock mountain. I will gladly continue to receive any and every transmission she sends down to us.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ’Pills’ is the off-kilter, whirligig result of Clark processing the modern condition, both her own and society’s. It’s wild-eyed and sarcastic, but also compassionate. (I recommend <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/st-vincents-seduction-and-my-mothers-career-at-playboy\">Clark’s appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour</a>, where she talks about the record and this song in particular.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-sampha--process\">5. Sampha — <em>Process</em></h3>\n<p>I knew Sampha’s voice from no fewer than three 5-star tracks on SBTRKT’s 2014 record <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em> (#3 on my list that year), and a feature on Kanye’s ‘Saint Pablo’. Additionally, though the exact vector escapes me now, somehow I heard Sampha’s track ‘Blood on Me’ toward the end of last year, and knew I had to look out for the album. That song has lost none of its power for me, and is surrounded here by immaculate pieces of songwriting that balance strength and tenderness both sonically and lyrically. Warm beats matched with soft tones play host to Sampha’s voice, which is perhaps the album’s most singular instrument as it floats above the music and dips down into it to play amongst the melodies. Throughout it’s a spectacularly accomplished and self-assured debut, clearly the product of a phenomenally talented musician bringing forth precisely the sound that’s in his head.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano’ is one of those tracks where a musician strips everything back to voice and one instrument and leaves you in awe. As emotionally raw as it is stark in its composition; it’s a striking moment at the centre of the album.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-fazerdaze--morningside\">4. Fazerdaze — <em>Morningside</em></h3>\n<p>There are some albums that you want to live inside. Imbued with warmth and brightness throughout, and a sense of weightless flow, <em>Morningside</em> joins my shortlist.\nThere are elements of shoegaze to the sound, particularly in the way the vocals are treated, but the relative sparseness of the instrumentation and lightness of the production leaves the record feeling open and inviting. It’s notable that several of the tracks get their pace from prominent bass lines that are very effective despite (or perhaps because of) their simplicity. There’s not a great variety to the sound, but the record is only just over the half-hour mark and at ~3 minutes per song it can feel as though each track is a variation on a theme. The result is an understated gem of an indie pop record that I expect to be playing for some time to come.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Lucky Girl’ is perhaps the most distilled form of the record’s sound, and eminently danceable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-bing--ruth--no-home-of-the-mind\">3. Bing &amp; Ruth — <em>No Home of the Mind</em></h3>\n<p>I know very little about the artist(s) behind this record, and I realise that I’ve unconsciously been safeguarding that ignorance so as not to spoil the mystique. This is ambient, post-classic music of precisely the kind I feel most in tune with. By turns haunting, uplifting, and meditative, these are pieces of tremendously adroit, understated composition. The piano is at each track’s centre, but is often found drifting in a sea of warm, shifting tones. The more I listened to it I started to feel as though this album sits somewhere halfway between the Radiohead of ‘Videotape’ &amp; ‘Give Up the Ghost’, and William Basinski’s <em>The Disintegration Loops</em>. It’s a more abstracted version of the former, which retains more of its formal integrity than that latter. And, similar to Basinski’s pieces, I’d be quite happy to play this for hours.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘The How of it Sped’ sounds as though it is accompanying some moment of heartbreak from an unseen film.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-joywave--content\">2. Joywave — <em>Content</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know what to do with this record. It snuck up on me. Joywave have one previous album to their name, which remains unknown to me because I have enough on my plate trying to digest this one.</p>\n<p>Comprising an eclectic sound palate (including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…) <em>Content</em> is mercurial in the extreme. The post-nu-metal riff that closes the otherwise danceable paean to lost innocence ‘Rumors’ doesn’t belong on the same album as the quiet, solo-piano lament of ‘Confidence’. But they’re actually sequenced right next to each other. And the latter is 48 seconds long. And it works!\nThere are obvious allusions to Radiohead circa <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) here, but Joywave occupy a dancier, groovier space than the Oxford set. Lyrically though, they’re dealing with similar themes – technology and its effect on humanity, feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-worth – and, being something like 25 years younger, coming at them from a different point of view.</p>\n<p>I find this record fascinating, and this band very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Going to a Place’ sounds like Keane got trapped in another dimension and sent a cry for help… and then it completely switches up half-way through and becomes something transportive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-jay-som--everybody-works\">1. Jay Som — <em>Everybody Works</em></h3>\n<p>Not infrequently it still amazes me what can come out of one person’s bedroom. Speaking personally for a moment, as someone who has spent the past year coming to terms with their own artistic limitations, it’s nothing short of astounding to me that one person, skilled in the use of the tools of a craft, can bring something as beautiful as <em>Everybody Works</em> forth from nothing.</p>\n<p>I could list some presumed influences on this record (shoegaze &amp; post-rock for example) but there’s at least a half-dozen distinct genres in the blend here. The result is an album that feels truly singular and of a piece to me: a 36 minute work of artistic expression, filled with human warmth, colour, and feeling.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘One More Time, Please’ is a perfect microcosm of the record in some respects. A disarming vocal, shining keys, and subtle low-key percussion, which all builds to a crescendoing guitar solo. Every note of every instrument performed by a 22 year old in her bedroom, sending something remarkable out into the world.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Run The Jewels — *Run the Jewels 3*\n\nAs I write this Kendrick Lamar’s *Damn* is topping year-end lists left and right and I’m wondering what I missed on an album I just didn’t connect with. Of the hip-hop that passed through my headphones this year I had a good time with Vince Staples’s *Big Fish Theory*, really liked Open Mike Eagle’s *Brick Body Kids Still Daydream* (but spent too little time with it), and bounced off most of the big hitters to one degree or another: as well as *Damn*, Jay-Z’s lukewarm *4:44* and Drake’s *More Life* did little for me, and I’ve never clicked with the Migos thing. \n\nThat leaves room for only one rap record on this year’s list, but it’s a doozy. RTJ remain a complete enigma to me: I don’t know how they came together, I don’t know why they give every record away instead of selling them, and I don’t know why their combo of braggadocio, political engagement, and downright silliness works (this is a mix that only seems to work in hip-hop, with Beastie Boys as perhaps the flag-bearers) – I’m just grateful for it all. \n\nHighlight: ‘Legend Has It’ is one of my most quoted songs of the year (for better or worse). It’s just the right mix of all the magic elements that make RTJ special. The moment when El P’s girlfriend interrupts to stop him completing one particularly crude line makes me smile, if not laugh, every time.\n\n\n###  19. Portico Quartet — *Art in the Age of Automation*\n\nThere were three records this year that I returned to time and again for a dose of calm, reflective ambience: one didn’t quite make the list (Andrew Bird’s *Echolocations: River*), one is further up this list, and the latest from Portico Quartet is the third.\nOnce again a four-piece following the departure of founding member Nick Mulvey and one record as a trio (renamed, simply Portico), *AitAoA* finds the band taking another progressive step with their sound. When they took 8th spot on my list in 2012 (with their eponymous LP), I ended my write-up by saying I was excited to see what was next. Actually, 2015’s *Living Fields* didn’t quite chime for me – essentially an electronica album, with some guest vocals I could live without, it felt like a band deliberately trying to make a clean break with the past, and ignoring their strengths to do so. This year’s record (following the addition to the roster of Kier Vine) feels like a very deliberate further sonic evolution, which brings back the more organic instrumentation and cuts the vocals. It’s precisely what I wanted from the follow up to Portico Quartet, and perhaps their strongest album to date.\n\nHighlight: ‘Current History’ takes as its base an effervescent, *Amnesiac*-style percussion pattern and layers tones and loops on top. \n\n\n###  18. Death From Above — *Outrage! Is Now*\n\nHere’s something I wrote when DFA’s *The Physical World* took top spot in my list for 2014:\n\n> It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power is a kind of compound triptych miracle. \n\nWho knows what kind of albums this band could have made in the decade-long interval between their studio debut and its follow-up? Perhaps it took that time, and the up & down intra-bandmate relationship, to make that second record. Whatever the case, I’m glad we didn’t have to wait so long for a third LP. \n\nSebastien Grainger is a great drummer and Jesse F. Keeler is a great bassist; both have a great ear for infectious hooks, and they share a willingness to push their compositions as far as they’ll go: harder, faster, heavier, groovier. Perhaps the least talked about weapon in the band’s arsenal is Grainger’s voice; it’s a passionate, vaulting, wonderfully tuneful thing that serves as a solid third pillar in their song-craft. \n\n*Outrage! Is Now* sounds like DFA. It sounds like someone lent them a couple of synths, but it’s unmistakably the same racket they made on the previous records. And man does it still get me!?\n\nHighlight: ‘Nvr 4Evr’ is classic DFA; the kind of track that bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club wish they’d written. \n\n\n###  17. Beck — *Colors*\n\nDo you remember that part in *Superman Returns* where Lex Luther explains to Kitty Kowalski that crystals take on the properties of the elements that surround them? I feel that Beck operates in a similar fashion: whatever given sound or vibe he turns his attention to, he’s able to produce music that feels authentic. Sometimes it’s meditative (eg. *Sea Change* (2002)), sometimes a little sombre (eg. *Morning Phase* (2014)), and sometimes poppy and easygoing (eg. *Odelay* (1996) & *Guero* (2005)). And no matter which category he’s playing in, Beck’s consistently doing something interesting with it. Whether it’s Brazilian influences on *Guero*, or the hip-hop touches to *The Information* (2006), Beck is a restlessly inventive artist in the same mould as Madonna or Björk (perhaps it’s something to do with the mononyms?). \n*Colors* is Beck in full-on pop assault mode. And he’s happy to pull from anywhere and everywhere to make it happen. Shamelessly detuned guitars and anthemic choruses; jaunty Beatles-esque piano; ’No Distraction’ sounds like Sting collaborating with The Killers. \nIn sum it’s the same trick that Daniel Johns et al managed to pull off with *Young Modern* (2007): the making of a pop album on one’s own artistic terms. It’s not quite as strange (or as sublime) as that Silverchair record, but both are unmistakably the work of diversely-talented musicians making a direct assault on whatever part of the brain responds to catchy pop music. \n\nHighlight: The panpipe melody that runs through title track ‘Colors’ – anything that can make me love the sound of an instrument I previously hated has to be doing something right.\n\n\n###  16. The xx — *I See You*\n\nTo my ears the third album from The xx sounds like a natural progression of a sound that started off very simple and somewhat reserved, and has blossomed into a form somewhat brighter, self-assured, and colourful. It’s only natural, in fact, that the band’s third album as a trio takes notes from *In Colour*, Jamie xx’s vibrant, dance-floor friendly solo album of 2015 (#8 on that year’s List). The blaring horns that start the record were called out by several reviewers as a shock departure for The xx’s sound; but the shock was far less if you’d allowed Jamie’s solo LP to work its magic on you a couple of years previously. \n\nAll of which is not to say that *I See You* sounds entirely different from its predecessors. The heart of the record is still the haunted, sleek blend of trip-hop and the lighter side of the EDM spectrum. And the songwriting is still coming from somewhere intensely personal. It’s not necessary to know about the friction between bandmates that sits behind tracks like ‘Say Something Loving’, and ‘Test Me’ in order to feel that these are songs crafted by people who felt them intensely. \n\nHighlight: ‘On Hold’ seemed a bit divisive when it was released ahead of the album, as it calls out the departures that The xx’s sound was taking on the record. Some reacted with shock or disappointment, but I was onboard immediately. \n\n\n###  15. Submerse — *Are You Anywhere*\n\nFor my money *Are You Anywhere* represents as strong a set of tracks as Submerse has released since I’ve been listening to him, starting with *Slow Waves* – which was my number 5 album of 2014. (*Stay Home* just missed out on a spot in 2015, and in 2016 he grabbed 13th for *Awake*.) Both the mix of organic & electronic elements, and the dazed-sounding production, are familiar from previous albums, and the spell that’s cast here is just as effective on me as ever. \n\nIn four albums and a couple of EPs over the last four years Submerse hasn’t really made much of a departure from his core sound. However, it’s a sound that I can’t get enough of, and my only complaint here is that 31 minutes is too short a time to spend in this sonic space.\n\nHighlight: ‘Too Many Sidequests’ makes use of Submerse’s knack for incorporating video game sound effects into alien soundscapes.\n\n\n###  14. INHEAVEN — *INHEAVEN*\n\nWhat happened to The Subways? Wikipedia says they’re still extant, but nothing’s been released in 5 years, and I don’t remember hearing anything in nearly a decade. Anyway: INHEAVEN have made a pretty great record in the same mould, with perhaps a bit more Pixies influence (hence the name, I guess), and a bit more lightness in its step. It’s loud, it’s brash, and it’s unashamedly fun more-or-less from start to finish. \n\nSongs like ‘Treats’ & ‘Vulture’ are designed for chanting along to, and I can’t listen to them without imagining what they would do to the front half of Brixton Academy. But this is a band that does have at least one gear above ‘simple crowd-pleasing stomper’ and it’s telling that several of the tracks here very quickly feel as though you’ve known them for a long time. \n\nHighlight: ‘Stupid Things’ is half sickly-sweet pop song and half tender-hearted confession. \n\n\n###  13. Toro y Moi — *Boo Boo*\n\nChaz Bear took fourth spot in 2015 with *What For?*, and it’s largely the same formula of dreamy tones, soft beats, and lightly-treated vocals that has him back on the list this time. ‘Mirage’ kicks off the album as it means to go on, and when it pauses three minutes in for Chaz to intone “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there”, I 100% believe that this music is just the soundtrack to his life, and we’re just showing up to peep in for another 50 minute dose. \n\nThe sound palate that *Boo Boo* shares with *What For?* is pretty singular – it’s identifiable within a couple of bars as TyM – and, as such, it’s likely to be a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Personally I find the relaxed, pastel-infused vibes on these records to be borderline medicinal. \n\nHighlight: ‘Girl Like You’ sounds like an 80s chart pop song (which I absolutely do not intend as a pejorative) fed through Chaz’s particular filter, and it comes out sounding no less sweet but perhaps a bit more interesting. \n\n\n###  12. Charly Bliss — *Guppy*\n\nRemember that dog. (mandatory lower case and full stop) – 90s grunge-influenced, optimismcore / original recipe emo LA outfit who released at least one and maybe two masterpieces on Geffen? There’s still a part of me that identifies strongly with late 90s cartoon misanthrope Daria, and in that guise I love both that dog. and, now, Charly Bliss. They’re from the other coast, and they’re 20 years late, but there’s no doubting they’re playing from the heart, and maybe that’s all you need to rekindle an old sound. It certainly worked on me instantly; there are guitar sounds on this record I haven’t heard since *Pinkerton* and, turns out, I’ve been missing them dearly.\n \nInfectious; exuberant; wilfully, naively upbeat… I need more of this sound in my life. There’s not much depth to what’s on offer here, but there doesn’t have to be. At least for a couple of records let’s just close our eyes and pretend it’s a couple of decades ago. \n\nHighlight: ‘Ruby’ just might be my favourite song of the year. Pixies bass, vintage Weezer guitar, and one of the album’s best lilting, acrobatic vocals. If you’ll forgive the pun, it’s kind of blissful. \n\n\n###  11. Shigeto — *The New Monday*\n\nWhen I grow up I want to be Jason Heyward, five-time Gold Glove winner and flawless right-fielder for the Chicago Cubs. One of the many problems with that is that Heyward is eight years younger than me. So my second choice is Zachary Shigeto Saginaw. (I’m pretty sure Shigeto is also younger than me, but I don’t know that for a fact!)\n\nMy first Shigeto record was *No Better Time Than Now*, 17th spot on this list for 2013, and I’ve been captivated ever since by his particular blend of electronica, hip-hop, and jazz. He’s endlessly inventive, effortlessly cool, and seemingly always able to capture a new sound or put a new spin on an old one. He’s also a ridiculous drummer. (I highly recommend watching some [videos of his live performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DduNRXh3h3o).)\n\n*The New Monday* is right up there with *No Better Time…* for me. I’m still listening to the earlier record, and I have no trouble believing I’ll still be playing this in five years. \n\nHighlight: Opener ‘Detroit Pt II’ is an evolution of one of *No Better Time Than Now’s* strongest tracks: ‘Detroit Pt I’. \n\n(Side note: Shigeto isn’t flawless. He put out another record this year as a duo with vocalist ZelooperZ, as ZGTO. I did not get on with that album at all! Still, even Jason Heyward drops a ball now and then.)\n\n\n###  10. Paramore — *After Laughter*\n\nOn 2013’s list I excused Paramore’s inclusion at number 12 by joking that I am, in fact, a 15-year old girl. Quite why one tends to feel some form of guilt or shame for liking certain things, I don’t know. So in that spirit, though I might like to make another joke, I have to hold my hand up now and say that this band makes really good pop-rock albums, and I love them without reservation. \n\nThere is likely nothing here to win over new fans. But, that said, there are some new departures in terms of sound. Overall the instrumentation feels more heavily weighted to electronic drums and synths where it would have been more uniformly guitars previously. Several of the tracks have a synthy, 80s vibe to them, telegraphed upfront by the Kraftwerk outro to opener ‘Hard Times’. Hayley Williams’s voice remains the group’s distinguishing factor, and is in fine form throughout here: by turns angry, soothing, empowered & empowering, and never less than note-perfect. \n\nMore of this please. Thanks.\n\nHighlight: ‘Fake Happy’ begins as an acoustic sketch and blossoms into a Cyndi Lauper-esque stomper straight from the heart. \n\n\n###  9. Arcade Fire — *Everything Now*\n\nI don’t know how they do it, but every time a new Arcade Fire album comes out I go through a period of disappointment, which lasts a few listens, before ultimately it wins me over completely and captures top spot on my year-end list. Well, everything except the final part of that process happened this time around also. \n\nI think there’s something about AF’s music that has this polarising effect on listeners. Spin called *Everything Now* “deeply cynical” and “joyless”; Pitchfork termed it “pale” and “joyless”, and yet I honestly don’t know what they’re hearing that I’m not, or what I’m hearing that they’re not. There are at least three tracks here that rank among the most musically euphoric the band have ever recorded. Which is maybe why just as many reviewers gave opinions similar to that of Slant, who thought *Everything Now* “by far Arcade Fire's most upbeat… album to date”.\n\nIt’s one thing to disagree on the quality of an album, but in my experience this level of disparity on something like a record’s tone is very unusual. Maybe this is a band that makes emotionally confusing music, that takes the listener a while to catch up to. \nIn short, this is still a band without a bad song in their catalogue. ‘Everything Now’, ‘Creature Comfort’, and ‘Put Your Money on Me’ are some of the best songs they’ve recorded, and yet this is their weakest album as a whole. After *White Blood Cells* and *Elephant* sometimes there’s an *Icky Thump*; after *OK Computer* and *Kid A* you’re allowed to make *The King of Limbs*. In both cases, as here, those are very strong records outshone by all their siblings.\n\nHighlight: The slow build of the ABBA-indebted ‘Put Your Money on Me’ is masterly. How something can sound simultaneously sad and like an 80s disco classic is… confusing. \n\n\n###  8. Lusine — *Sensorimotor*\n\nBack in March I was taking an early morning flight to the UK. It was due to depart Iceland at just after 06:00, which meant arriving at the airport sometime around 04:00; and to get to the airport there’s a ~45 minute coach ride from Reykjavik. That’s too early to pay attention to a podcast, or to concentrate on a book under some tiny, ineffective reading light. So I pressed play on a record I’d added to my library simply because I add everything that Ghostly International release to my library. It seems probable to me that *Sensorimotor* will always remind me of that drive out to the airport in the early morning dark. That’s just what the album sounds like to me now. \nThe backbone of the record is a collection of bass beats and superior electronic sweeps. Out of which are composed a series of haunted sonic landscapes that feel monochromatic and restless, like a brain roused too early from sleep it would prefer to return to. \n\nHighlight: ‘Slow Motion’ is a bundle of nervous energy laid over a kick that sounds like a skipping heartbeat. \n\n\n###  7. Four Tet — *New Energy*\n\nI’ve been listening to Four Tet now for a little less than 15 years. In that time there have been some notable shifts in focus for the music that Kieran Hebden is creating. *Rounds* (2003) was the record that kicked off my interest, and is still held as the epitome of a certain (now possibly extinct?) sub-sub-genre somewhat awkwardly termed 'folktronica'. *Everything Ecstatic* (2005) was vibrant and urgent, and in some ways presaged the shift that followed it. *There is Love in You* (2010) & *Pink* (2012) felt more like collections of tracks designed for the dance-floor. Not that they weren’t enjoyable coming through headphones or home speakers, just that the records themselves felt a little less cohesive even if they still retained the power to excite and move. This period was capped off with *Beautiful Rewind* (2013), which felt like the culmination of that particular sound for Hebden. The bifurcated nature of the EP *Morning / Evening* (2015) was a leading sign of the next shift that Four Tet’s music would take. \n\nTo me, even on first listen, *New Energy* feels like that latest sound’s full arrival. Unmistakably there are call-backs to what has come before – in fact the sound might best be thought of as a seamless amalgamation of everything Four Tet has released to this point. And that’s some feat. This is a complex, multi-layered work that bears repeated listening, but which engages the listener on a very human level. Warm, open, and never less than a joy to listen to. \n\nHighlight: Tough to pick one, but right now the steady, hypnotic ebb of ‘Daughter’ is my favourite. That will change tomorrow. \n\n\n###  6. St. Vincent — *MASSEDUCTION*\n\nAnnie Clark nabbed second spot in 2014 with her previous, eponymous album; I’ve been waiting impatiently ever since to find out what would come next. The answer, it seems, is another very fine collection of postmodern agit-pop that contains more ideas in each song than many bands have on a record. \n\nFor me, there’s no ‘Digital Witness’ here, and perhaps not quite a ‘Birth in Reverse’, but this is one of those cases where comparison purely to the artist’s own catalogue gives a misleading picture. Simply put: not many musicians are making music like Annie Clark. Maybe it feels particularly acute in the post-Bowie / post-Prince world, but I find myself at pains to find and applaud this kind of brave, soul-searching, uncomfortable artistry. St. Vincent is an artist working in rarified air, way up there on the art-rock mountain. I will gladly continue to receive any and every transmission she sends down to us. \n\nHighlight: ’Pills’ is the off-kilter, whirligig result of Clark processing the modern condition, both her own and society’s. It’s wild-eyed and sarcastic, but also compassionate. (I recommend [Clark’s appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/st-vincents-seduction-and-my-mothers-career-at-playboy), where she talks about the record and this song in particular.)\n\n\n###  5. Sampha — *Process*\n\nI knew Sampha’s voice from no fewer than three 5-star tracks on SBTRKT’s 2014 record *Wonder Where We’ll Land* (#3 on my list that year), and a feature on Kanye’s ‘Saint Pablo’. Additionally, though the exact vector escapes me now, somehow I heard Sampha’s track ‘Blood on Me’ toward the end of last year, and knew I had to look out for the album. That song has lost none of its power for me, and is surrounded here by immaculate pieces of songwriting that balance strength and tenderness both sonically and lyrically. Warm beats matched with soft tones play host to Sampha’s voice, which is perhaps the album’s most singular instrument as it floats above the music and dips down into it to play amongst the melodies. Throughout it’s a spectacularly accomplished and self-assured debut, clearly the product of a phenomenally talented musician bringing forth precisely the sound that’s in his head.\n\nHighlight: ‘(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano’ is one of those tracks where a musician strips everything back to voice and one instrument and leaves you in awe. As emotionally raw as it is stark in its composition; it’s a striking moment at the centre of the album. \n\n\n###  4. Fazerdaze — *Morningside*\n\nThere are some albums that you want to live inside. Imbued with warmth and brightness throughout, and a sense of weightless flow, *Morningside* joins my shortlist. \nThere are elements of shoegaze to the sound, particularly in the way the vocals are treated, but the relative sparseness of the instrumentation and lightness of the production leaves the record feeling open and inviting. It’s notable that several of the tracks get their pace from prominent bass lines that are very effective despite (or perhaps because of) their simplicity. There’s not a great variety to the sound, but the record is only just over the half-hour mark and at ~3 minutes per song it can feel as though each track is a variation on a theme. The result is an understated gem of an indie pop record that I expect to be playing for some time to come.\n\nHighlight: ‘Lucky Girl’ is perhaps the most distilled form of the record’s sound, and eminently danceable.\n\n\n###  3. Bing & Ruth — *No Home of the Mind*\n\nI know very little about the artist(s) behind this record, and I realise that I’ve unconsciously been safeguarding that ignorance so as not to spoil the mystique. This is ambient, post-classic music of precisely the kind I feel most in tune with. By turns haunting, uplifting, and meditative, these are pieces of tremendously adroit, understated composition. The piano is at each track’s centre, but is often found drifting in a sea of warm, shifting tones. The more I listened to it I started to feel as though this album sits somewhere halfway between the Radiohead of ‘Videotape’ & ‘Give Up the Ghost’, and William Basinski’s *The Disintegration Loops*. It’s a more abstracted version of the former, which retains more of its formal integrity than that latter. And, similar to Basinski’s pieces, I’d be quite happy to play this for hours. \n\nHighlight: ‘The How of it Sped’ sounds as though it is accompanying some moment of heartbreak from an unseen film. \n\n\n###  2. Joywave — *Content*\n\nI don’t know what to do with this record. It snuck up on me. Joywave have one previous album to their name, which remains unknown to me because I have enough on my plate trying to digest this one. \n\nComprising an eclectic sound palate (including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…) *Content* is mercurial in the extreme. The post-nu-metal riff that closes the otherwise danceable paean to lost innocence ‘Rumors’ doesn’t belong on the same album as the quiet, solo-piano lament of ‘Confidence’. But they’re actually sequenced right next to each other. And the latter is 48 seconds long. And it works!\nThere are obvious allusions to Radiohead circa *OK Computer* (1997) here, but Joywave occupy a dancier, groovier space than the Oxford set. Lyrically though, they’re dealing with similar themes – technology and its effect on humanity, feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-worth – and, being something like 25 years younger, coming at them from a different point of view.\n\nI find this record fascinating, and this band very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent.\n\nHighlight: ‘Going to a Place’ sounds like Keane got trapped in another dimension and sent a cry for help… and then it completely switches up half-way through and becomes something transportive. \n\n\n### 1. Jay Som — *Everybody Works*\n\nNot infrequently it still amazes me what can come out of one person’s bedroom. Speaking personally for a moment, as someone who has spent the past year coming to terms with their own artistic limitations, it’s nothing short of astounding to me that one person, skilled in the use of the tools of a craft, can bring something as beautiful as *Everybody Works* forth from nothing. \n\nI could list some presumed influences on this record (shoegaze & post-rock for example) but there’s at least a half-dozen distinct genres in the blend here. The result is an album that feels truly singular and of a piece to me: a 36 minute work of artistic expression, filled with human warmth, colour, and feeling. \n\nHighlight: ‘One More Time, Please’ is a perfect microcosm of the record in some respects. A disarming vocal, shining keys, and subtle low-key percussion, which all builds to a crescendoing guitar solo. Every note of every instrument performed by a 22 year old in her bedroom, sending something remarkable out into the world.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

Deftones — <em>Gore</em></h3>\n<p>Deftones topped 2012’s List with <em>Koi No Yokan</em> after a stretch of three albums in ten years that\ndidn&rsquo;t live up to the promise of 2000’s career-defining <em>White Pony</em>. Four years\nlater I’m happy to find <em>Gore</em> again hitting all of the right notes and innovating a\nlittle further sonically to keep them where they belong (as pretty much the\nonly heavy rock act I pay attention to any more). <em>Gore</em> is the first album to be\nreleased since the death of original bassist Chi Cheng in 2013 (following the\ncar crash in 2008 that left him in a coma). As such it is necessarily coloured\n(particularly lyrically) by Chino Moreno dealing with the final loss of his friend\nand bandmate. As with much of Deftones’ previous work, there is an expert\nblending of darkness &amp; anger with lighter, more emotionally nuanced\nelements that allow the band to access a lot of places that other acts in the\nsame space can&rsquo;t or don’t. There’s a finesse to their art, with Moreno’s voice\nstill setting the tone, and the instrumentation as adept as ever in supporting\nthe emotional direction(s) of the songs.</p>\n<p>Following Cheng’s death there has been talk of releasing the now legendary\n<em>Eros</em>, the album that was near-complete at the time of his accident. It would\nbe very interesting to know what a Deftones album recorded in 2008 would\nsound like were it released now. As it is, I’m just happy that the band are still\nmaking new music of this standard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-honeyblood--babes-never-die\">19. Honeyblood — <em>Babes Never Die</em></h3>\n<p>After a swelling intro, the title track establishes quickly exactly what kind of\nrecord Honeyblood have made: post-bubblegum garage pop, and throughout\na dozen tracks it’s delivered here in excellent form. Album high-point ‘Ready\nfor the Magic’ has detuned bass, handclaps, and a chorus to die for or dance\nto (take your pick). There are a couple of down-tempo moments (such as the\nMelvins-meet-Breeders dirge of ‘Love is a Disease’), but the main vibe is a\nkind of slant coyness, showcased in various attitudes from the sweeping\n‘Gangs’ to the low thrum of ‘Walking at Midnight’. Honeyblood know how to\ncraft a bridge, and at 39 minutes they also know how to get in and get out\nhaving delivered a few body blows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-chance-the-rapper--coloring-book\">18. Chance the Rapper — <em>Coloring Book</em></h3>\n<p>Spoilers: you’re not going to find Kanye West’s <em>The Life of Pablo</em> on this list. That\nrecord is overly long, very self-indulgent (as you might expect), occasionally\ntranscendently masterful, but often frustratingly pedestrian or confused. As\nevents surrounding its release may have hinted, and events since have\nconfirmed, Kanye isn’t in a great place right now, and personally I think that\ncontributed to <em>…Pablo</em> being a bit of a mess.</p>\n<p>Chance’s <em>Coloring Book</em> is the record I wish Kanye still feels he could make.\nIt’s the record that <em>Late Registration</em>-era Kanye could have put together in two\nweeks, but its relaxed attitude, sunny vibes, and good humour now seem\n(temporarily at least) beyond Chicago’s first son of rap; that baton has been\npassed, and Chance is running with it. Perhaps ironically it picks up precisely\nwhere Chance’s contribution to Kanye’s best track of 2016 — ‘Ultralight\nBeam’ — left off, and from there it soars through bouncy floor-fillers and\nrelaxed summer jams, rarely pausing to take a breath. With ‘Blessings’\nChance has fashioned perhaps what amounts to a sonic calling card: humble,\nnot overworked, relaxed, and fairly glowing right out the speakers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-thao--the-get-down-stay-down--a-man-alive\">17. Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down — <em>A Man Alive</em></h3>\n<p>30 seconds or so into album opener ‘Astonished Man’ one thinks ‘this sounds\nkinda like tUnE-yArDs’, and one is not wrong: produced by Merrill Garbus,\nthis set of quirky dark-pop belays her ear for space and gain, for fuzz and\nweird editing choices and for simple, driving percussion that holds down\nsomething otherwise less grounded. (‘Astonished Man’ was also the subject\nof an excellent <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/thao\">episode of Song Exploder</a> this year, which reveals the song’s\ndeeply-personal roots.) Thao’s voice is an instrument perfectly-suited to\nswitching from conversational to plaintive to innocent and sing-songy. It’s in\nparticularly good form somersaulting all over the Pixies-ish ‘The Evening’,\nwhich just about loses out on album-highlight honours in favour of the catchy\nmoodswing of ‘Nobody Dies’, which is possessed of the kind of chorus you’ll\nsing the first time, hum for days, and then just bellow out the next time you\nhear it. Every part of the band gets a moment to shine on <em>A Man Alive</em>, but I\nfound that my favourite moments were often the Regina Spektor-esque\nconfessional moments, such as on ‘Guts’ (the second-best song with that title\nin 2016). Come for the pop, stay for the barrage of interesting ideas and left-\nof-centre hooks.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-beyonce--lemonade\">16. Beyonce — <em>Lemonade</em></h3>\n<p>To this point Beyonce hasn’t been an album artist for me. There have been a\nhandful of singles through the years that have lit up my radar and caught in\nmy mind, but it hasn’t been enough to convince me to spend an hour with her\nmusic. The 65 minute music video that accompanied the release of\n<em>Lemonade</em> was more than enough to change my mind: beautiful, inventive,\nand extraordinarily accomplished, the first watch of that film remains one of\nmy cultural high-points of 2016. It also serves as an excellent showcase of\nwhat a diverse collection of music is to be found on the album itself. Hip-hop,\nR&amp;B, soul-flavours, a little country on ‘Daddy Lessons’, a pure-bred ballad\nlike ‘Sandcastles’, whatever garage rock-vibed thing Jack White’s helping bring\nforth on ‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’&hellip; there’s a lot here. And it’s all delivered with\nenergy to spare and immaculately produced. There’s also the much-\npublicised matter of the album’s central subject: her husband’s infidelity. It’s a\ntheme that provides the emotional fuel for all of the music here, and keeps\nit feeling honest, and it’s also the joining thread that runs through what\notherwise may have felt like a disparate collection of tracks. It should also be\nnoted that ‘Freedom’ is top 5 songs of the year material, and felt increasingly\nprophetic and necessary as 2016 wore on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-olafur-arnalds--nils-frahm--trance-frendz\">15. Olafur Arnalds &amp; Nils Frahm — <em>Trance Frendz</em></h3>\n<p>Arnalds’s solo record <em>&hellip;And They Have Escaped\nthe Weight of Darkness</em> places 12th on my List in 2010, and represents both my serious\nintroduction to his work and the reason I’ve followed him since. Nils Frahm\ntook a deserved 12th spot with <em>Solo</em> last year (a record given some new life\nthis year by the release of a kind of director’s cut edition: <em>Solo Remains</em>).\nTheir working together is the kind of partnership that seems so inevitable that\nit must surely have been a case of when as opposed to whether. Pleasingly,\nthe fruits of the partnership, whilst familiar-sounding, are different enough that\nthey seem unlikely to have ever emerged from one or other of the artists\nalone. Spare and delicate in composition as they both are they have taken\nobvious care not to do too much here, and to facilitate one another where it\nwould have been easy for toes to be trodden upon. An ill-fitting title (it would\nhave been incredible if they’d made a trance record though), inscrutable track\nnames, and an album cover that looks like something they decided wasn’t\nquite interesting enough to go on Instagram, is all par for the course, and all\nmeaningless once ‘20:17’ begins and you can forget everything else in the\nworld for three-quarters of an hour. Beautiful stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-flume--skin\">14. Flume — <em>Skin</em></h3>\n<p>The last few years I’ve seemingly latched on to at least one album of bright,\nwarm electronica that stays on heavy rotation for months. Fort Romeau’s\n<em>Insides</em> played the role last year, and it was SBTRKT’s sublime <em>Wonder\nWhere We&rsquo;ll Land</em> in 2014; this year the task falls to <em>Flume</em>. Similarly to that\nSBTRKT record this is a set of songs that benefit from a host of guest\nvocalists lending distinct flavours to a number of tracks throughout, but it’s all\nunderpinned with the a softly undulating blanket of pastel-coloured warmth\nthat ebbs and flows to its own hypnotising rhythm. Album-opener ‘Helix’\ncrests with a minute to go, and sets the relaxed tempo, then picked up by\nhighlight track ‘Never Be Like You’. Raekwon makes a notable appearance,\nand the record closes on a mellow high with Beck lending vocals to ‘Tiny\nCities’, but what kept this playing for me was the soundscape that Flume\nconjures throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-submerse--awake\">13. Submerse — <em>Awake</em></h3>\n<p>Submerse took 5th spot in 2014 with the wonderful <em>Slow Waves</em>, and whilst I\nenjoyed the follow-up (2015’s <em>Stay Home</em>) it just missed out on last year’s list.\n<em>Awake</em> finds Submerse back on The List and further securing his place as\none of my desert island artists. Ethereal opener &lsquo;Too Late, They’re Already\nHere’ is transportive, and gives way to perhaps my favourite Submerse track,\n‘Sidequests’: a shimmering pool of muted pops, shining chimes, and a mellow\nsynth are met by a minimal refrain in a climbing register. Like many of his\ntracks, it blends the electronic and the acoustic seamlessly into something\nunique-feeling and oddly alive. I listened to this set of tracks dozens of times\nthis year and found new things on each play through. At this point it would be\na shock if the next Submerse release sounded dramatically different to this,\nsince his recent output is all quite similar, but I’m excited for it regardless.\nThis is a sonic space I&rsquo;ll happily return to time and time again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-solange--a-seat-at-the-table\">12. Solange — <em>A Seat at the Table</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s something I’ve struggled with a bit this year: a prevailing sense that\nsome of the music I got the most enjoyment from is not intended for me.\nWhilst sensitive to cultural heritage I’m not a believer that such broad\ndistinctions as ‘white music’ and ‘black music’ exist; I don’t subscribe to the\nreductive idea that entire genres of music are the province of one set of\npeople or another. However, when an album like <em>A Seat at the Table</em> comes\nalong, and speaks in large part about the black experience, there’s a reflexive\nguilt and fear of cultural appropriation that rises in me at claiming it as one of\nmy favourite albums of the year. Oddly, this isn’t something that seems to\ntranslate to other media: I have no problem saying that Ta-Nehisi Coates’s\n<em>Between the World and Me</em> was one of the very best books I read this year, or\nthat <em>The Get Down</em> and <em>Atlanta</em> were two of my favourite TV shows of 2016 -\nall exemplary pieces of art that deal directly, primarily with black cultural\nhistory. Still, in the final analysis it would be disingenuous of me to leave\nSolange off this list. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is a collection of beautifully crafted,\nsoul-infused R&amp;B songs that mix the deeply personal with insightful social\ncommentary like few records I’ve heard the last couple of years. It is bold and\nvital, and despite all the ways in which it’s not for me it gave me too much not\nto recognise the important role it played in my listening in 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-angel-olsen--my-woman\">11. Angel Olsen — <em>MY WOMAN</em></h3>\n<p>What drew me to the (obligatorily fully capped-up) MY WOMAN in the first\nplace was catching the track ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ being played on Beats1. Had\nthe album been a wash that still would have been fine, since that one track — with it’s endearing mix of bokeh warmth and aching longing — ended up being\nprobably my favourite song of 2016. Fortunately there are plenty of other\ntreats in store on an album that puts garage pop-rock through its paces,\nwhilst bending it to all of its intended purposes: exciting, yearning,\ncommiserating, celebrating, and the painting of personal stories of loss and\nmisunderstanding in love. Olsen’s voice is the right balance between\nemotionally affected and lackadaisical, and her guitar is usually found in a\nsimilar (Ben Kweller-esque) attitude, moving between relaxed strum and\nenergised pounding of the three or four chords that make up each song.</p>\n<p>This is an easygoing album full of memorable, hummable, sing-alongable\nsongs. It spawned a couple of the year’s stickiest tracks as far as my inner\near was concerned, with ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ not the only song from the\ncollection that continued spinning ad infinitum in my mind. (PS The roller-skating video to that song is also a lot of fun.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-ryo-fukui--mellow-dream\">10. Ryo Fukui — <em>Mellow Dream</em></h3>\n<p>I listened to a bit more jazz this year than has been the case the last couple,\nand whilst there have been a few records I’ve enjoyed (shouts to Takuya\nKuroda’s <em>Zigzagger</em> and Shabaka &amp; the Ancestors’ <em>Wisdom of Elders</em>) only\none really got its hooks into me in a serious must-play-every-other-day kind of\nway. <em>Mellow Dream</em> is aptly titled, and I never got tired of closing my eyes and\nrevisiting Fukui’s lively, colourful compositions. Some of the absolute best,\nmost energetic and surprising piano playing I’ve heard in years over the top of\na bass and percussion line that always knows just what’s required to keep\neach piece flowing. The title track / opener and follow-up ‘My Foolish Heart’\nare light and breezy, where ‘Baron Potato Blues’ has a bit more of a swagger,\nand the closing rendition of ‘My Funny Valentine’ is a little sad and demure. Throughout it’s impossible not to be impressed by Fukui’s playing, but taken holistically the\nalbum is an equally impressive achievement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-gold-panda--good-luck-and-do-your-best\">9. Gold Panda — <em>Good Luck and Do Your Best</em></h3>\n<p>The charming friendliness of this album’s title is carried over into its\nwelcoming ambience. Though occasionally employing some harder edges\n(such as on the haunting ‘Song for a Dead Friend’), the album’s overall vibe is\nof easygoing acceptance. Acoustic instruments layer upon drum patterns and\nsparingly-employed synth to make beautiful sculptures of sound like the\nmeditative and hypnotic ‘Time Eater’, and the resigned, good-natured\n‘Autumn Fall’. At the album’s centre is a track called ‘I Am Real Punk’ which\ndespite its title displays a kind of measured grace; its a microcosm of this self-\nassured, slightly odd collection of electronica.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-lone--levitate\">8. Lone — <em>Levitate</em></h3>\n<p>I find it difficult to believe now that Lone’s 2014 record <em>Reality Testing</em> didn&rsquo;t\nmake my top 20 for that year, but there you go: times change. Much like on\nthat record <em>Lone</em> has here put together a dazzling set of breakbeats over and\nthrough which he weaves hard-edged synth in deeply rhythmic patterns. Very\nfew tracks swung harder for me this year than ‘Backtail Was Heavy’, and it\nhas a couple of nice counterpoints here in the frenetic ‘Triple Helix’ and the\nslowly imploding ‘Sleepwalkers’. Levitate is a record that finds that sweet\nspot: at 34 minutes (good portions of which push the BPMs) it doesn’t outstay\nits welcome, but it also never runs out of ideas. As the closing moments of\n‘Hiraeth’ ebb away I almost always wanted to loop back to the start and take\nthe journey again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-holy-fuck--congrats\">7. Holy Fuck — <em>Congrats</em></h3>\n<p>Holy Fuck are one of those bands that I’ve been hearing about for years, and\nhave never taken the time to get to know. When I finally saw too many\nrecommendations for <em>Congrats</em> to ignore, and tuned in, I was immediately\nglad that I did. For one thing — speaking a bit reductively — in a year with no\nLiars LP and no Battles LP this helped fill a requirement for a particular type\nof over-energised, spiralling, de-tuned noise. Taken on its own merits though\n(as it should be) <em>Congrats</em> is raucous, sonically all-encompassing, and\nendlessly inventive: it keeps you off balance throughout in the same way the\nbetter Mars Volta records do. Album high point ‘House of Glass’ takes turns at\nbeing punishing, then jaunty, then punishing again as it unleashes a central\nbass-heavy refrain that sounds like a heart attack. There are certainly subtler\nmoments, such as on the interlude ‘Shimmering’ and the rather poppier ‘Neon\nDad’, but this isn’t pretending to be a pop album. It’s an odd thing, which\nchallenges you to wrestle with it and in doing so dig out some hidden\ntreasures. It’s well worth the effort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-tegan--sara--love-you-to-death\">6. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Love You To Death</em></h3>\n<p>A new T&amp;S album will likely always remain a landmark release for me purely\non the strength of 2004’s near-flawless <em>So Jealous</em>. But it would be wrong to\nthink of the Quins as still riding the wake of one great album as they’ve\nconsistently found ways to experiment with their own sound in new and\nimpressive ways. <em>The Con</em> (2007) managed to find a way out of <em>So Jealous’s</em>\nshadow by virtue of being odder, exhibiting rougher textures and sharper\nangles; <em>Sainthood</em> in 2009 took a larger step towards synth-based\ncompositions, and <em>Heartthrob</em> doubled down on that in 2013. If anything I feel\nlike I was a little behind the curve on those last two records, feeling a little\ndisappointed by them in the first instance before being won over by their\ninfectious charms. I felt more prepared for <em>Love You To Death</em>, and sure\nenough I was on board from Music’s first plays of ‘Boyfriend’, ‘100x’ and\npersonal favourite ‘Stop Desire’ that preceded the albums release. 32\nminutes, 10 tracks, not a bad one in sight (despite some occasionally\nquestionable half-rhyme lyrics here and there) and this record takes its place\namongst my top 5 Tegan &amp; Sara albums. It’s testament to their enduring\nexcellence that that is rare company to be in.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-explosions-in-the-sky--the-wilderness\">5. Explosions in the Sky — <em>The Wilderness</em></h3>\n<p>The short way to encapsulate how I feel about <em>The Wilderness</em> is to say that\nit’s EitS’s best LP since 2003’s <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em>, which\npretty much defined my personal understanding of post-rock. They’ve made\nvery good albums since, but this is the first to light up my synapses like the\nalbum that introduced me to them. Built largely of the same stuff as previous\nalbums — percussion that has the force of weather events, and great, snaking\nrivers of melody carving through canyon walls of guitar — this record also finds\nplaces to introduce some muted electronic elements; never in a way that\nradically alters the band’s now-signature sound, but certainly in ways that\ncomplement and tweak it in subtle ways, surely make long-term\nlisteners to EitS prick up their ears. My favourite of the record’s tracks is a\ntoss-up between the propulsive, evangelic currant of ‘Tangle Formations’, and\nthe darker, Basinski-referencing first single ‘Disintegration Anxiety’. Nothing\nhere is going to change anyone’s mind about the band (I wonder sometimes\nwhether their rapturous live show might have the power to do so), but it is a\nwelcome thing to find a band 17 years on from their formation still making\ncompelling music that is very much their own.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bloc-party--hymns\">4. Bloc Party — <em>Hymns</em></h3>\n<p>In some respects the most quietly revolutionary album of 2016. After a four\nyear break following <em>Intimacy</em> it didn’t feel like a sure thing that we’d see\nanother Bloc Party album. And even after the successes of <em>Four</em> (2012) the\nfour year break that followed that album had a ring of finality about it.\nIn some bands (even four-pieces) it would be no big thing to replace the\ndrummer and bassist; not so with Bloc Party, where Matt Tong and Gordon\nMoakes’s contributions were always beyond the average. Sure enough\n<em>Hymns</em> isn’t showcase to the same kind of frenetic, self-perpetuating drum\npatterns as previous of the band’s albums, and there are perhaps fewer truly\nmemorable bass lines. However, that is at least in part down to the way in\nwhich the band’s sound has reconfigured itself here. The tempos are often\nmore forgiving (certainly than was the case on <em>Four</em>), there is greater\nemphasis on Kele’s voice (with which he seems to feel increasingly\ncomfortable). What remains is songwriting split fairly evenly between\nconfessional and social commentary, and equally strong at each. But the\ntextures that are new to Bloc Party offer an opportunity to reach into new\nspaces: the unsettled oddness of ‘Different Drugs’; the romantic swell of ‘My\nTrue Name’ undercut by a haunting choral vocal; the proto-gospel euphoria of\n‘Only He Can Heal Me’, which takes its place amongst the band’s best tracks.\nI remain happy just to have this band around, I’m always excited to see what\nBloc Party do next, and for the first time I don’t really have a good idea what it\nmight sound like.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-elohim--elohim\">3. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>\n<p>Elohim was the discovery of 2016 for me, and several months on this record\nremains just as alluring and confounding as when I first ran across it. Opener\n‘Sensations’ is all you need in order to know whether this will be a record for\nyou; it hooked me after a single verse and chorus and hasn’t let go since.\nPoppier than Bat for Lashes and less angular than Grimes, this is still\ndefiantly odd alt-pop music and with a dark edge that’s reflected in the\nperformer’s penchant for wearing masks onstage and in her videos. (It’s\nworth mentioning that one of Elohim’s strongest tracks from 2016 —’Hallucinations’ —isn’t on this album, but was released on a subsequent EP\nand is also accompanied by perhaps my favourite (single-track) music video\nof the year.) ‘She Talks Too Much’ is winking and a little giddy; ‘Xanax’ is aptly\nwashed out and dreamlike, and feature’s one of 2016’s most memorable\nrefrains (“every day of my day of my day of my life”); ‘Guts’, though, squeaks\ninto the album-highlight spot by somehow channeling both Robyn and Jim\nGuthrie. Singular but all the more magnetic for it, I couldn’t get enough of this.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-rihanna--anti\">2. Rihanna — <em>ANTI</em></h3>\n<p>As I wrote above in relation to Beyoncé, despite a set of jewel-perfect singles\nI had not previously thought of Rihanna as an album artist. Like the rest of the\nworld then (if for different reasons), I wasn’t prepared for <em>ANTI</em>. Long in\ncoming though it has been, when the album finally arrived at the tail end of\nthe kind of wilfully obfuscatory social-media marketing campaign that is\nseemingly now de rigueur (see also <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, <em>Views</em>, <em>Lemonade</em>,\n<em>Blond(e)</em>) the reaction from music press and listening public alike was a near-\nuniversal: ‘wha?’. I lost track of the number of times people pointed out there\nwas no ‘Umbrella’ here, no ‘Take a Bow’ or ‘Only Girl’, as though a pop artist\nis expected to work to a quota of one banger per x number of other songs,\nwith which they can do what they like. On <em>ANTI</em> Rihanna is plainly not\ninterested in working to the one-for-me-one-for-the-dancefloor model. Instead\nshe’s happy to be flirtatious and demanding on ‘Work’, coy on ‘Kiss it Better’,\nand somewhat terrifying on ‘Needed Me’, all the while delivering flawless\nvocal performances (seriously, ‘Higher’ alone remains near-unbelievable after\n100+ listens) over the top of immaculate, captivating beats. If you need\nsomething else you can go listen to those Calvin Harris tracks that she makes\ninto pop masterpieces just by showing up. I’ll be here swaying to ‘Love on the\nBrain’ or crying to ‘Close to You’.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-radiohead--a-moon-shaped-pool\">1. Radiohead — <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em></h3>\n<p>I honestly don’t know where to start when talking about Radiohead. Perhaps\nit’s enough to say that I’ve been on a quest for about 10 years to find anyone\nwho makes music that sounds anything like theirs, and I haven’t come up with\nanything. Radiohead, at this point, is a one-band genre, but one that shifts\nand re-colours itself to always remain stunningly relevant and new-seeming.\n<em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em> isn’t so much an album of music as it is the latest\ndispatch in the cataloguing of the British liberal psyche: this is who we are at\nthe moment, and how we feel, it seems to say. Still concerned about our\nlonelinesses and our failures, still preoccupied with finding a place in the\nworld, but also increasingly overwhelmed by larger events, and frightened by\nthe evanescence of hope.</p>\n<p>Arcade Fire do voice and hope, and are similarly documentarian; Liars do\ncomplex and dense layers of confused feeling; Sigur Ros do rapture;\nExplosions in the Sky do overwhelm and exorcism… only Radiohead\nconsistently find a way to put all of those components together, and always in\nbeautiful new ways that continue to awe me. We’re so very lucky to have\nthem.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Deftones — *Gore*\n\nDeftones topped 2012’s List with *Koi No Yokan* after a stretch of three albums in ten years that\ndidn't live up to the promise of 2000’s career-defining *White Pony*. Four years\nlater I’m happy to find *Gore* again hitting all of the right notes and innovating a\nlittle further sonically to keep them where they belong (as pretty much the\nonly heavy rock act I pay attention to any more). *Gore* is the first album to be\nreleased since the death of original bassist Chi Cheng in 2013 (following the\ncar crash in 2008 that left him in a coma). As such it is necessarily coloured\n(particularly lyrically) by Chino Moreno dealing with the final loss of his friend\nand bandmate. As with much of Deftones’ previous work, there is an expert\nblending of darkness & anger with lighter, more emotionally nuanced\nelements that allow the band to access a lot of places that other acts in the\nsame space can't or don’t. There’s a finesse to their art, with Moreno’s voice\nstill setting the tone, and the instrumentation as adept as ever in supporting\nthe emotional direction(s) of the songs.\n\nFollowing Cheng’s death there has been talk of releasing the now legendary\n*Eros*, the album that was near-complete at the time of his accident. It would\nbe very interesting to know what a Deftones album recorded in 2008 would\nsound like were it released now. As it is, I’m just happy that the band are still\nmaking new music of this standard.\n\n###  19. Honeyblood — *Babes Never Die*\n\nAfter a swelling intro, the title track establishes quickly exactly what kind of\nrecord Honeyblood have made: post-bubblegum garage pop, and throughout\na dozen tracks it’s delivered here in excellent form. Album high-point ‘Ready\nfor the Magic’ has detuned bass, handclaps, and a chorus to die for or dance\nto (take your pick). There are a couple of down-tempo moments (such as the\nMelvins-meet-Breeders dirge of ‘Love is a Disease’), but the main vibe is a\nkind of slant coyness, showcased in various attitudes from the sweeping\n‘Gangs’ to the low thrum of ‘Walking at Midnight’. Honeyblood know how to\ncraft a bridge, and at 39 minutes they also know how to get in and get out\nhaving delivered a few body blows.\n\n###  18. Chance the Rapper — *Coloring Book*\n\nSpoilers: you’re not going to find Kanye West’s *The Life of Pablo* on this list. That\nrecord is overly long, very self-indulgent (as you might expect), occasionally\ntranscendently masterful, but often frustratingly pedestrian or confused. As\nevents surrounding its release may have hinted, and events since have\nconfirmed, Kanye isn’t in a great place right now, and personally I think that\ncontributed to *…Pablo* being a bit of a mess.\n\nChance’s *Coloring Book* is the record I wish Kanye still feels he could make.\nIt’s the record that *Late Registration*-era Kanye could have put together in two\nweeks, but its relaxed attitude, sunny vibes, and good humour now seem\n(temporarily at least) beyond Chicago’s first son of rap; that baton has been\npassed, and Chance is running with it. Perhaps ironically it picks up precisely\nwhere Chance’s contribution to Kanye’s best track of 2016 — ‘Ultralight\nBeam’ — left off, and from there it soars through bouncy floor-fillers and\nrelaxed summer jams, rarely pausing to take a breath. With ‘Blessings’\nChance has fashioned perhaps what amounts to a sonic calling card: humble,\nnot overworked, relaxed, and fairly glowing right out the speakers.\n\n###  17. Thao & The Get Down Stay Down — *A Man Alive*\n\n30 seconds or so into album opener ‘Astonished Man’ one thinks ‘this sounds\nkinda like tUnE-yArDs’, and one is not wrong: produced by Merrill Garbus,\nthis set of quirky dark-pop belays her ear for space and gain, for fuzz and\nweird editing choices and for simple, driving percussion that holds down\nsomething otherwise less grounded. (‘Astonished Man’ was also the subject\nof an excellent [episode of Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/thao) this year, which reveals the song’s\ndeeply-personal roots.) Thao’s voice is an instrument perfectly-suited to\nswitching from conversational to plaintive to innocent and sing-songy. It’s in\nparticularly good form somersaulting all over the Pixies-ish ‘The Evening’,\nwhich just about loses out on album-highlight honours in favour of the catchy\nmoodswing of ‘Nobody Dies’, which is possessed of the kind of chorus you’ll\nsing the first time, hum for days, and then just bellow out the next time you\nhear it. Every part of the band gets a moment to shine on *A Man Alive*, but I\nfound that my favourite moments were often the Regina Spektor-esque\nconfessional moments, such as on ‘Guts’ (the second-best song with that title\nin 2016). Come for the pop, stay for the barrage of interesting ideas and left-\nof-centre hooks.\u2029\n\n###  16. Beyonce — *Lemonade*\n\nTo this point Beyonce hasn’t been an album artist for me. There have been a\nhandful of singles through the years that have lit up my radar and caught in\nmy mind, but it hasn’t been enough to convince me to spend an hour with her\nmusic. The 65 minute music video that accompanied the release of\n*Lemonade* was more than enough to change my mind: beautiful, inventive,\nand extraordinarily accomplished, the first watch of that film remains one of\nmy cultural high-points of 2016. It also serves as an excellent showcase of\nwhat a diverse collection of music is to be found on the album itself. Hip-hop,\nR&B, soul-flavours, a little country on ‘Daddy Lessons’, a pure-bred ballad\nlike ‘Sandcastles’, whatever garage rock-vibed thing Jack White’s helping bring\nforth on ‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’... there’s a lot here. And it’s all delivered with\nenergy to spare and immaculately produced. There’s also the much-\npublicised matter of the album’s central subject: her husband’s infidelity. It’s a\ntheme that provides the emotional fuel for all of the music here, and keeps\nit feeling honest, and it’s also the joining thread that runs through what\notherwise may have felt like a disparate collection of tracks. It should also be\nnoted that ‘Freedom’ is top 5 songs of the year material, and felt increasingly\nprophetic and necessary as 2016 wore on.\n\n###  15. Olafur Arnalds & Nils Frahm — *Trance Frendz*\n\nArnalds’s solo record *...And They Have Escaped\nthe Weight of Darkness* places 12th on my List in 2010, and represents both my serious\nintroduction to his work and the reason I’ve followed him since. Nils Frahm\ntook a deserved 12th spot with *Solo* last year (a record given some new life\nthis year by the release of a kind of director’s cut edition: *Solo Remains*).\nTheir working together is the kind of partnership that seems so inevitable that\nit must surely have been a case of when as opposed to whether. Pleasingly,\nthe fruits of the partnership, whilst familiar-sounding, are different enough that\nthey seem unlikely to have ever emerged from one or other of the artists\nalone. Spare and delicate in composition as they both are they have taken\nobvious care not to do too much here, and to facilitate one another where it\nwould have been easy for toes to be trodden upon. An ill-fitting title (it would\nhave been incredible if they’d made a trance record though), inscrutable track\nnames, and an album cover that looks like something they decided wasn’t\nquite interesting enough to go on Instagram, is all par for the course, and all\nmeaningless once ‘20:17’ begins and you can forget everything else in the\nworld for three-quarters of an hour. Beautiful stuff.\n\n###  14. Flume — *Skin*\n\nThe last few years I’ve seemingly latched on to at least one album of bright,\nwarm electronica that stays on heavy rotation for months. Fort Romeau’s\n*Insides* played the role last year, and it was SBTRKT’s sublime *Wonder\nWhere We'll Land* in 2014; this year the task falls to *Flume*. Similarly to that\nSBTRKT record this is a set of songs that benefit from a host of guest\nvocalists lending distinct flavours to a number of tracks throughout, but it’s all\nunderpinned with the a softly undulating blanket of pastel-coloured warmth\nthat ebbs and flows to its own hypnotising rhythm. Album-opener ‘Helix’\ncrests with a minute to go, and sets the relaxed tempo, then picked up by\nhighlight track ‘Never Be Like You’. Raekwon makes a notable appearance,\nand the record closes on a mellow high with Beck lending vocals to ‘Tiny\nCities’, but what kept this playing for me was the soundscape that Flume\nconjures throughout.\n\n###  13. Submerse — *Awake*\n\nSubmerse took 5th spot in 2014 with the wonderful *Slow Waves*, and whilst I\nenjoyed the follow-up (2015’s *Stay Home*) it just missed out on last year’s list.\n*Awake* finds Submerse back on The List and further securing his place as\none of my desert island artists. Ethereal opener 'Too Late, They’re Already\nHere’ is transportive, and gives way to perhaps my favourite Submerse track,\n‘Sidequests’: a shimmering pool of muted pops, shining chimes, and a mellow\nsynth are met by a minimal refrain in a climbing register. Like many of his\ntracks, it blends the electronic and the acoustic seamlessly into something\nunique-feeling and oddly alive. I listened to this set of tracks dozens of times\nthis year and found new things on each play through. At this point it would be\na shock if the next Submerse release sounded dramatically different to this,\nsince his recent output is all quite similar, but I’m excited for it regardless.\nThis is a sonic space I'll happily return to time and time again.\n\n###  12. Solange — *A Seat at the Table*\n\nHere’s something I’ve struggled with a bit this year: a prevailing sense that\nsome of the music I got the most enjoyment from is not intended for me.\nWhilst sensitive to cultural heritage I’m not a believer that such broad\ndistinctions as ‘white music’ and ‘black music’ exist; I don’t subscribe to the\nreductive idea that entire genres of music are the province of one set of\npeople or another. However, when an album like *A Seat at the Table* comes\nalong, and speaks in large part about the black experience, there’s a reflexive\nguilt and fear of cultural appropriation that rises in me at claiming it as one of\nmy favourite albums of the year. Oddly, this isn’t something that seems to\ntranslate to other media: I have no problem saying that Ta-Nehisi Coates’s\n*Between the World and Me* was one of the very best books I read this year, or\nthat *The Get Down* and *Atlanta* were two of my favourite TV shows of 2016 -\nall exemplary pieces of art that deal directly, primarily with black cultural\nhistory. Still, in the final analysis it would be disingenuous of me to leave\nSolange off this list. *A Seat at the Table* is a collection of beautifully crafted,\nsoul-infused R&B songs that mix the deeply personal with insightful social\ncommentary like few records I’ve heard the last couple of years. It is bold and\nvital, and despite all the ways in which it’s not for me it gave me too much not\nto recognise the important role it played in my listening in 2016.\n\n###  11. Angel Olsen — *MY WOMAN*\n\nWhat drew me to the (obligatorily fully capped-up) MY WOMAN in the first\nplace was catching the track ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ being played on Beats1. Had\nthe album been a wash that still would have been fine, since that one track — with it’s endearing mix of bokeh warmth and aching longing — ended up being\nprobably my favourite song of 2016. Fortunately there are plenty of other\ntreats in store on an album that puts garage pop-rock through its paces,\nwhilst bending it to all of its intended purposes: exciting, yearning,\ncommiserating, celebrating, and the painting of personal stories of loss and\nmisunderstanding in love. Olsen’s voice is the right balance between\nemotionally affected and lackadaisical, and her guitar is usually found in a\nsimilar (Ben Kweller-esque) attitude, moving between relaxed strum and\nenergised pounding of the three or four chords that make up each song.\n\nThis is an easygoing album full of memorable, hummable, sing-alongable\nsongs. It spawned a couple of the year’s stickiest tracks as far as my inner\near was concerned, with ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ not the only song from the\ncollection that continued spinning ad infinitum in my mind. (PS The roller-skating video to that song is also a lot of fun.)\n\n###  10. Ryo Fukui — *Mellow Dream*\n\nI listened to a bit more jazz this year than has been the case the last couple,\nand whilst there have been a few records I’ve enjoyed (shouts to Takuya\nKuroda’s *Zigzagger* and Shabaka & the Ancestors’ *Wisdom of Elders*) only\none really got its hooks into me in a serious must-play-every-other-day kind of\nway. *Mellow Dream* is aptly titled, and I never got tired of closing my eyes and\nrevisiting Fukui’s lively, colourful compositions. Some of the absolute best,\nmost energetic and surprising piano playing I’ve heard in years over the top of\na bass and percussion line that always knows just what’s required to keep\neach piece flowing. The title track / opener and follow-up ‘My Foolish Heart’\nare light and breezy, where ‘Baron Potato Blues’ has a bit more of a swagger,\nand the closing rendition of ‘My Funny Valentine’ is a little sad and demure. Throughout it’s impossible not to be impressed by Fukui’s playing, but taken holistically the\nalbum is an equally impressive achievement.\n\n###  9. Gold Panda — *Good Luck and Do Your Best*\n\nThe charming friendliness of this album’s title is carried over into its\nwelcoming ambience. Though occasionally employing some harder edges\n(such as on the haunting ‘Song for a Dead Friend’), the album’s overall vibe is\nof easygoing acceptance. Acoustic instruments layer upon drum patterns and\nsparingly-employed synth to make beautiful sculptures of sound like the\nmeditative and hypnotic ‘Time Eater’, and the resigned, good-natured\n‘Autumn Fall’. At the album’s centre is a track called ‘I Am Real Punk’ which\ndespite its title displays a kind of measured grace; its a microcosm of this self-\nassured, slightly odd collection of electronica.\n\n###  8. Lone — *Levitate*\n\nI find it difficult to believe now that Lone’s 2014 record *Reality Testing* didn't\nmake my top 20 for that year, but there you go: times change. Much like on\nthat record *Lone* has here put together a dazzling set of breakbeats over and\nthrough which he weaves hard-edged synth in deeply rhythmic patterns. Very\nfew tracks swung harder for me this year than ‘Backtail Was Heavy’, and it\nhas a couple of nice counterpoints here in the frenetic ‘Triple Helix’ and the\nslowly imploding ‘Sleepwalkers’. Levitate is a record that finds that sweet\nspot: at 34 minutes (good portions of which push the BPMs) it doesn’t outstay\nits welcome, but it also never runs out of ideas. As the closing moments of\n‘Hiraeth’ ebb away I almost always wanted to loop back to the start and take\nthe journey again.\n\n###  7. Holy Fuck — *Congrats*\n\nHoly Fuck are one of those bands that I’ve been hearing about for years, and\nhave never taken the time to get to know. When I finally saw too many\nrecommendations for *Congrats* to ignore, and tuned in, I was immediately\nglad that I did. For one thing — speaking a bit reductively — in a year with no\nLiars LP and no Battles LP this helped fill a requirement for a particular type\nof over-energised, spiralling, de-tuned noise. Taken on its own merits though\n(as it should be) *Congrats* is raucous, sonically all-encompassing, and\nendlessly inventive: it keeps you off balance throughout in the same way the\nbetter Mars Volta records do. Album high point ‘House of Glass’ takes turns at\nbeing punishing, then jaunty, then punishing again as it unleashes a central\nbass-heavy refrain that sounds like a heart attack. There are certainly subtler\nmoments, such as on the interlude ‘Shimmering’ and the rather poppier ‘Neon\nDad’, but this isn’t pretending to be a pop album. It’s an odd thing, which\nchallenges you to wrestle with it and in doing so dig out some hidden\ntreasures. It’s well worth the effort.\n\n###  6. Tegan & Sara — *Love You To Death*\n\nA new T&S album will likely always remain a landmark release for me purely\non the strength of 2004’s near-flawless *So Jealous*. But it would be wrong to\nthink of the Quins as still riding the wake of one great album as they’ve\nconsistently found ways to experiment with their own sound in new and\nimpressive ways. *The Con* (2007) managed to find a way out of *So Jealous’s*\nshadow by virtue of being odder, exhibiting rougher textures and sharper\nangles; *Sainthood* in 2009 took a larger step towards synth-based\ncompositions, and *Heartthrob* doubled down on that in 2013. If anything I feel\nlike I was a little behind the curve on those last two records, feeling a little\ndisappointed by them in the first instance before being won over by their\ninfectious charms. I felt more prepared for *Love You To Death*, and sure\nenough I was on board from Music’s first plays of ‘Boyfriend’, ‘100x’ and\npersonal favourite ‘Stop Desire’ that preceded the albums release. 32\nminutes, 10 tracks, not a bad one in sight (despite some occasionally\nquestionable half-rhyme lyrics here and there) and this record takes its place\namongst my top 5 Tegan & Sara albums. It’s testament to their enduring\nexcellence that that is rare company to be in.\u2029\n\n###  5. Explosions in the Sky — *The Wilderness*\n\nThe short way to encapsulate how I feel about *The Wilderness* is to say that\nit’s EitS’s best LP since 2003’s *The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place*, which\npretty much defined my personal understanding of post-rock. They’ve made\nvery good albums since, but this is the first to light up my synapses like the\nalbum that introduced me to them. Built largely of the same stuff as previous\nalbums — percussion that has the force of weather events, and great, snaking\nrivers of melody carving through canyon walls of guitar — this record also finds\nplaces to introduce some muted electronic elements; never in a way that\nradically alters the band’s now-signature sound, but certainly in ways that\ncomplement and tweak it in subtle ways, surely make long-term\nlisteners to EitS prick up their ears. My favourite of the record’s tracks is a\ntoss-up between the propulsive, evangelic currant of ‘Tangle Formations’, and\nthe darker, Basinski-referencing first single ‘Disintegration Anxiety’. Nothing\nhere is going to change anyone’s mind about the band (I wonder sometimes\nwhether their rapturous live show might have the power to do so), but it is a\nwelcome thing to find a band 17 years on from their formation still making\ncompelling music that is very much their own.\u2029\n\n### 4. Bloc Party — *Hymns*\n\nIn some respects the most quietly revolutionary album of 2016. After a four\nyear break following *Intimacy* it didn’t feel like a sure thing that we’d see\nanother Bloc Party album. And even after the successes of *Four* (2012) the\nfour year break that followed that album had a ring of finality about it.\nIn some bands (even four-pieces) it would be no big thing to replace the\ndrummer and bassist; not so with Bloc Party, where Matt Tong and Gordon\nMoakes’s contributions were always beyond the average. Sure enough\n*Hymns* isn’t showcase to the same kind of frenetic, self-perpetuating drum\npatterns as previous of the band’s albums, and there are perhaps fewer truly\nmemorable bass lines. However, that is at least in part down to the way in\nwhich the band’s sound has reconfigured itself here. The tempos are often\nmore forgiving (certainly than was the case on *Four*), there is greater\nemphasis on Kele’s voice (with which he seems to feel increasingly\ncomfortable). What remains is songwriting split fairly evenly between\nconfessional and social commentary, and equally strong at each. But the\ntextures that are new to Bloc Party offer an opportunity to reach into new\nspaces: the unsettled oddness of ‘Different Drugs’; the romantic swell of ‘My\nTrue Name’ undercut by a haunting choral vocal; the proto-gospel euphoria of\n‘Only He Can Heal Me’, which takes its place amongst the band’s best tracks.\nI remain happy just to have this band around, I’m always excited to see what\nBloc Party do next, and for the first time I don’t really have a good idea what it\nmight sound like.\u2029\n\n###  3. Elohim — *Elohim*\n\nElohim was the discovery of 2016 for me, and several months on this record\nremains just as alluring and confounding as when I first ran across it. Opener\n‘Sensations’ is all you need in order to know whether this will be a record for\nyou; it hooked me after a single verse and chorus and hasn’t let go since.\nPoppier than Bat for Lashes and less angular than Grimes, this is still\ndefiantly odd alt-pop music and with a dark edge that’s reflected in the\nperformer’s penchant for wearing masks onstage and in her videos. (It’s\nworth mentioning that one of Elohim’s strongest tracks from 2016 —’Hallucinations’ —isn’t on this album, but was released on a subsequent EP\nand is also accompanied by perhaps my favourite (single-track) music video\nof the year.) ‘She Talks Too Much’ is winking and a little giddy; ‘Xanax’ is aptly\nwashed out and dreamlike, and feature’s one of 2016’s most memorable\nrefrains (“every day of my day of my day of my life”); ‘Guts’, though, squeaks\ninto the album-highlight spot by somehow channeling both Robyn and Jim\nGuthrie. Singular but all the more magnetic for it, I couldn’t get enough of this.\u2029\n\n###  2. Rihanna — *ANTI*\n\nAs I wrote above in relation to Beyoncé, despite a set of jewel-perfect singles\nI had not previously thought of Rihanna as an album artist. Like the rest of the\nworld then (if for different reasons), I wasn’t prepared for *ANTI*. Long in\ncoming though it has been, when the album finally arrived at the tail end of\nthe kind of wilfully obfuscatory social-media marketing campaign that is\nseemingly now de rigueur (see also *The Life of Pablo*, *Views*, *Lemonade*,\n*Blond(e)*) the reaction from music press and listening public alike was a near-\nuniversal: ‘wha?’. I lost track of the number of times people pointed out there\nwas no ‘Umbrella’ here, no ‘Take a Bow’ or ‘Only Girl’, as though a pop artist\nis expected to work to a quota of one banger per x number of other songs,\nwith which they can do what they like. On *ANTI* Rihanna is plainly not\ninterested in working to the one-for-me-one-for-the-dancefloor model. Instead\nshe’s happy to be flirtatious and demanding on ‘Work’, coy on ‘Kiss it Better’,\nand somewhat terrifying on ‘Needed Me’, all the while delivering flawless\nvocal performances (seriously, ‘Higher’ alone remains near-unbelievable after\n100+ listens) over the top of immaculate, captivating beats. If you need\nsomething else you can go listen to those Calvin Harris tracks that she makes\ninto pop masterpieces just by showing up. I’ll be here swaying to ‘Love on the\nBrain’ or crying to ‘Close to You’.\u2029\n\n###  1. Radiohead — *A Moon Shaped Pool*\n\nI honestly don’t know where to start when talking about Radiohead. Perhaps\nit’s enough to say that I’ve been on a quest for about 10 years to find anyone\nwho makes music that sounds anything like theirs, and I haven’t come up with\nanything. Radiohead, at this point, is a one-band genre, but one that shifts\nand re-colours itself to always remain stunningly relevant and new-seeming.\n*A Moon Shaped Pool* isn’t so much an album of music as it is the latest\ndispatch in the cataloguing of the British liberal psyche: this is who we are at\nthe moment, and how we feel, it seems to say. Still concerned about our\nlonelinesses and our failures, still preoccupied with finding a place in the\nworld, but also increasingly overwhelmed by larger events, and frightened by\nthe evanescence of hope.\n\nArcade Fire do voice and hope, and are similarly documentarian; Liars do\ncomplex and dense layers of confused feeling; Sigur Ros do rapture;\nExplosions in the Sky do overwhelm and exorcism… only Radiohead\nconsistently find a way to put all of those components together, and always in\nbeautiful new ways that continue to awe me. We’re so very lucky to have\nthem.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Michael Ondaatje’s novel <em>In The Skin of a Lion</em> (1987) is full of exquisite detail, used in bringing to life some beautifully crafted characters and extraordinary events. It’s a book that moves from a brilliantly rendered Canadian river to a palatial waterworks plant via a stolen yacht, a mushroom factory, a prison and a house aflame. Ondaatje’s command of language is absolute; no matter how unlikely the situation he does not fall into cartoonishness, and even though some of his more colourful characters risk caricature, he expertly keeps them from crossing that line. And yet for all this, the one sentence of the novel that caught me most off guard is simple and declarative, possessed of some less ornate form of the magic the author uses elsewhere. I stopped, copied the sentence out onto a notepad and stared at it for a while.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The waitress with the tattoo gave him his coffee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What was it about these nine words that had stopped me in my tracks? My immediate impression of the sentence was of its crystalline clarity; it gives the reader an action perfectly, and more than that it gives us a scene. We have been introduced to this waitress a couple of chapters before. She was the subject of four paragraphs in which Ondaatje gives us his protagonist’s impressions of her: she is silent, adept at her job, complete in and of herself, and harmoniously integrated with her workplace. She is the subject of Patrick’s somewhat melancholy attention only briefly on the page, though she represents something important to him: a part of his routine. The waitress’s constancy is reassuring to Patrick amid the absences and uncertainties elsewhere in his life.

				"title": "The List 2015",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-the-necks--vertigo\">20. The Necks — <em>Vertigo</em></h3>\n<p>Kicked off in 2006 when I fell hard for <em>Chemist</em>, and continuing through a dalliance with the peerless <em>Silverwater</em> (2009) as well as an <a href=\"/neckslive\">unforgettable Barbican live performance</a>, my love affair with The Necks continues. There have been a few releases in between, but the 44 minutes of <em>Vertigo’s</em> single track have been the first to stick firmly in my mind and find me consistently playing a Necks release in a little while.</p>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the band’s sound this is exactly what you’d expect, and if you’re not it’s very difficult to describe. The tags you’d apply to it—’improvised’ &amp; ‘jazz’ chief amongst them—are useful to a point, but not necessarily indicative of just how successfully this trio create a singular-feeling music: unrepeatable and yet entirely consistent in terms of the levels of interest and intrigue it sustains. All of which makes it even less palatable that I was in London on the final night of their Café Oto residency and did not manage to secure a ticket!</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-battles--la-di-da-di\">19. Battles — <em>La Di Da Di</em></h3>\n<p>When the new Battles line-up dropped <em>Dross Glop</em> in 2012, five years on and one member down from the glorious debut <em>Mirrored</em> (2007) I was super-excited, and then — once the sugar rush had abated — a little disappointed with the result. The album had its moments, but the loss of Tyondai Braxton was notable (indeed, in retrospect, Braxton’s solo album <em>Central Market</em> (2009) was the stronger post-<em>Mirrored</em> output). It’s gratifying then to find Battles, a couple of years into the new lineup, genuinely returned to their full strength. Opener here ‘The Yabba’ (the track titles make as little sense as ever) is as strong as anything on the debut; both ‘Dot Net’ and ‘FF Bada’ repurpose drum patterns familiar from that first record but find new and inventive ways to use them - woven in with an instrumental palate that has the strange honour of now feeling totally familiar as well as distinctly off-kilter.</p>\n<p>There’s certainly the odd moment when you wonder whether a line has been crossed (such as on the impenetrable opening minute of &lsquo;Tricentennial’) but those can be waived in light of how good it is to hear this band back to their endlessly inventive best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-florence--the-machine--how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful\">18. Florence + The Machine — <em>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</em></h3>\n<p>I haven’t paid all that much attention to Florence Welch since debut album <em>Lungs</em> arrived alongside debuts from Little Boots &amp; La Roux in 2009. It was ‘Bulletproof’ &amp; ‘In For The Kill’ from the latter that stuck with me that year, and then all three artists kind of faded from view for me.</p>\n<p>After an underwhelming return by La Roux last year, it comes as a welcome surprise that F+TM’s record really got to me this time around. I read a review at the time that pointed out the symbolic importance of Welch’s facing forward on the album cover for the first time. And indeed this does feel like a more directly addressed, more personal set of songs. Less obtuse, adorned with less in the way of theatrics, the record embraces naked emotionality as its throughline. There are certainly poetic flourishes to the lyrics, and the album isn’t without bombast (‘Queen of Peace’ rises and blooms like a firework display), but it feels somehow more personal than both the artist’s previous output and that of the majority of her contemporaries.</p>\n<p>It should be mentioned also, that the 4-minute white rapids journey of opener ‘Ship to Wreck’ is quite possibly the best song I heard all year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-squarepusher--damogen-furies\">17. Squarepusher — <em>Damogen Furies</em></h3>\n<p>Over a 20+ year career I’ve payed far too little attention to Squarepusher. The closest I got previously was a dip into 2010’s Shobaleader One: <em>d’Demonstrator</em> - itself a kind of spin-off album featuring an expanded lineup. <em>Damogen Furies</em> is my first exposure to Squarepusher-prime, and it’s left me a little shaken but thrilled and hungry for more. Comprising a host of somewhat raw-sounding electronica elements, settled in a bed of off-kilter, low wind instruments, or 16-bit era videogame chiptune soundscapes, the overall tone of the album is somewhere between menacing and schizophrenic — not dissimilar to Reznor’s OST for <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em>.</p>\n<p>At its most frenetic the drum patterning walks a line between highly measured and almost-freeform jazz, ricocheting all over the map and pulling the melodies into any number of new, convoluted forms. (One of my favourite examples of this is once ‘Baltang Ort’ gets past the 4.30 mark and loses its composure a bit; that last minute is insane.) It’s a remarkable achievement to make something so mechanical seem at the same time organic - responsive to shifts in the music’s mood.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-will-butler--policy\">16. Will Butler — <em>Policy</em></h3>\n<p>Will Butler, here, has the same thing going for him as going against him: his membership of Arcade Fire. It’s doubtful — or at least significantly less likely — that I would have picked up this record without that background, and yet it comes freighted with a baggage that is entirely unfair. What Butler has produced is nothing more and nothing less than a collection of simple songs. Each one has an emotional directness familiar to listeners of his previous works, and they move between valences with aplomb. ‘Finish What I Started’ is a two-minute plea from the heart, and then it’s straight into ‘Son of God’: something close to an understated call for revolution.</p>\n<p>There’s a smattering of multi-instrumentalism, but it sounds more like one man jumping from piano to keyboard to guitar, and less like the glorious, polychromatic racket that the collective of which he’s an integral part are capable of building. There’s also the nagging fact of how close Will’s voice is to that of brother Win. In a year without an Arcade Fire album this was a welcome dose of some watered-down substitute. That’s a very unfair thing to say about a pretty great album of alt-pop songs, but it was the feeling I couldn’t shake on the many occasions I listened to it. Sorry Will.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-wolf-alice--my-love-is-cool\">15. Wolf Alice — <em>My Love is Cool</em></h3>\n<p>The list of bands I listened to religiously in the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s that are obvious influences on Wolf Alice is long. And there’s no effort made to disguise that here, on an album that feels both a little familiar and oddly quaint in its delivery of a 20+ year old sound. Opener ‘Turn to Dust’ is as pretty as it is alluring, with just a hint of sadness enough to make you wonder what other colours the band will paint with. It’s the sort of effortless conjuring of mood that Laura Marling displayed time and again on her first couple of albums. When, after just over 3 minutes, the album shifts into ‘Bros’, the listener is assured that they’re in safe hands; I certainly didn’t hear a prettier straight-ahead, guitar-led pop song this year - so simple in its construction, yet executed beautifully enough to bring a tear to my eye on several listens.</p>\n<p>I’m left with questions about what the future holds for Wolf Alice: another collection of easygoing pop-rock singalongs that risks diminishing returns, or the temptation to risk something that may be outside their comfort zone? For now though, we have a really solid debut that does one thing very well indeed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-fort-romeau--insides\">14. Fort Romeau — <em>Insides</em></h3>\n<p>I’d made the decision before the start of the year to listen to every 2015 release that Ghostly International put out, so – even if this hadn’t come recommended by Kieran Hebden — I would have run across it eventually.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why the man behind Four Tet likes what fellow Brit Mike Greene is doing here: it occupies largely the same space as Hebden’s own <em>Rounds</em> (2003): a kind of warm, comfortable, trancelike feeling somewhere between early morning tiredness and lazy sunbeam comfort. There are denser moments, such as the bass-driven ‘All I Want’, but they are swells upon an otherwise even-tempered expanse of musical ocean.</p>\n<p>(This ended up being my favourite eligible Ghostly release for the year, though Shigeto’s <em>Intermission</em> EP, would be way up there if it was a little longer than 6 tracks &amp; ~20 minutes.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-ibeyi--ibeyi\">13. Ibeyi — <em>Ibeyi</em></h3>\n<p>The two voices at the heart of Ibeyi’s self-titled debut are almost indistinguishable, belonging as they do to twins: Naomi &amp; Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Both are light, playful, and soulful, painting flowing lines over beds of minimal piano and simple beats. At times they’re also haunting, used to great effect in mirroring or weaving in and out of each other, such as on album highlight ‘River’ where they hold a kind of conversation amid the waves of their own background harmonising.</p>\n<p>It no doubt helps that I first heard this record when we were in Copenhagen in February, and it’s linked in my mind with a great week we spent out there. The album’s sonic warmth conjures for me, every time, the warmth of the apartment we were staying in, and to which we returned after days walking in biting cold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-nils-frahm--solo\">12. Nils Frahm — <em>Solo</em></h3>\n<p>In much the same way that Ghostly International started to colonise great swathes of my listening time a couple of years ago, London-based label Erased Tapes have made a huge impact for me recently: I got a lot of listening out of Kiasmos’s self-titled LP last year; A Winged Victory for the Sullen provided me with an unforgettable live experience in a Danish church this February&hellip; and there’s another ET artist elsewhere on this list. Hence it’s fitting that I came to Frahm via labelmate Ólafur Arnalds, a kindred spirit and sometime collaborator (they put out an EP together this year actually, which — though ineligible for The List — is a recommended listen also).</p>\n<p>In terms of the album itself — a collection of masterfully constructed piano pieces —there’s not too much to say. There is some variation: the slightness of ‘Chant’ and the swell of ‘Wall’, but the album is best considered of a piece, and the mood it evokes is singular. The <em>Pitchfork</em> review phrased it this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;[I]t’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me, it was, easily. On several occasions this year it was precisely the record I needed, and to which I turned when nothing else would do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-the-sidekicks--runners-in-the-nerved-world\">11. The Sidekicks — <em>Runners in the Nerved World</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not sure how I came to listen to this; a January release that has stuck around tenaciously to claim a spot on The List, and has done so by charm more than anything else. Touchstones here are bands like The Shins and Saves the Day, and this record firmly filled the same spot this year as Local Natives’ <em>Hummingbird</em> a couple of years ago: the best example that happened to cross into my awareness of a musical style far more prevalent on these lists in the early 2000s and appearing with increasing rarity since. Nevertheless this is the real thing and faithfully delivered. Steve Ciolek’s voice is an empathetic through-line with a range between falsetto fragility and convincing moments of emotional conviction.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Blissfield, MI’ is the record’s high point, though its driving bravado is something of an outlier on an album primarily comprising prettier pop-rock. The track also contains the album’s best lyric; the kind of glimpse into personal emotional-geography that late ‘90s / early ’00s emo at its best did so well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel like how the Bulls felt in 1993<br>\nI feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"10-shamir--ratchet\">10. Shamir — <em>Ratchet</em></h3>\n<p>Another debut album for The List, and another distinct vocal - Shamir Bailey’s performance is by turns fragile (in the manner of a Michael Jackson ballad), cocky, or occasionally fierce. Low-key opener ‘Vegas’ keys the listener into a couple of the record’s themes — sin, pleasure — but is quickly undercut in a piece of genius sequencing by ‘Make A Scene’: a none-more-pop chant littered with unidentifiable sound effects, something that sounds distinctly like cow-bell, and a vaulting laser effect that draws the listener’s ear up and over Bailey’s falsetto.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of catchy — if insubstantial — pleasures on offer, but the best track on the album is inarguably ‘On The Regular’, also probably 2015’s most infectious song. Its blend of lightness, self-assurance, and touches of thematic darkness are a good microcosm of the album in general. In the final analysis though, it was Shamir’s ear for a hook and the wit of his lyrics that brought me back to this time and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-purity-ring--another-eternity\">9. Purity Ring — <em>Another Eternity</em></h3>\n<p>For whatever reason Purity Ring’s debut (<em>Shrines</em> (2012)) didn’t make it onto my radar, and my introduction to the band came when I asked Siri to identify a song which turned out to be ‘Bodyache’ in a coffee shop this summer. Not long after that I was hooked on an album delicately balancing bright, dense synths and a similarly-toned female vocal. There are a few rhythm &amp; blues touches here and there (the cadence of ‘Repetition’ for example), but it’s one influence among a spectrum, all blended here amongst warm synth-swaths to produce an album it’s easy to submerge yourself in and not want to emerge from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing even slightly revolutionary here, but it’s an album — like Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> (2012) and SBTRKT’s <em>Wonder Where We Land</em> (2014) — that builds a cohesive and vibrant world of sound that pulled me in and kept me entranced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-jamie-xx--in-colour\">8. Jamie xx — <em>In Colour</em></h3>\n<p>There’s something very smart about Jamie xx’s marking this solo release by calling out in the title (and album cover) the contrast to The xx’s predominantly monochrome aesthetic. That relationship is carried through to the music also, with the record feeling more expansive, more energetic, and wider-ranging than the (superb) work Jamie’s put out alongside Romy Madley Croft &amp; Oliver Sim. Touching on the same positive-vibes club scene sound as Four Tet’s recent output, the record moves at a pace and imparts a real warmth without ever moving much beyond third gear.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Gosh’ is a cheeky statement of intent. ’Stranger in a Room’ is night-driving music; traffic-lights refracted through rain music - cool in tone and soporific. ‘Hold Tight’ is a helter-skelter, hypnotic headphone trip. ’Obvs’ even manages to make good use of one of my least-favourite instruments: the steel drum.</p>\n<p>I got a real kick out of this collection of assorted brighter, club-electronica sounds, and it’s left me even more excited for a third LP from The xx in 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-rival-consoles--howl\">7. Rival Consoles — <em>Howl</em></h3>\n<p>And here’s that other member of the Erased Tapes roster alluded to earlier. Ryan Lee West’s set of constantly shifting soundscapes put a spell on me this year. As with Squarepusher earlier in this list, this is electronic music engaged in the exploration of what happens when a pattern is disrupted, complicated, and altered. Not as fraught as the music on <em>Damogen Furies</em>, but just as restless, this is an album for headphones not just because of its density and intricacy, but also because of its propulsiveness. It’s music to walk to, run to, and ride rails to.</p>\n<p>Each track is distinct, none outstay their welcome, and West knows when he’s stretched a beat to its breaking point, and thus when to move on. There’s a melancholy to some of the album’s lower tones, but elsewhere there’s a playfulness, and energy to spare (such as displayed by the shuffling brush-played drums underneath album highlight ‘Low’). Closing track ‘Looming’ is perhaps the collection’s tightest package; the euphoric shivers of synth that run through it ringing out like harbingers of a sunrise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-nosaj-thing--fated\">6. Nosaj Thing — <em>Fated</em></h3>\n<p>There’s a tone and a tempo of electronica that I’ve been continuously hunting since Flying Lotus’s <em>Cosmogramma</em> put me under its spell in 2010. Shigeto’s <em>No Better Time Than Now</em> satisfied the itch in 2013, and last year the role was played by Submerse’s <em>Slow Waves</em>; in 2015 the honour goes to the third record by Jason Chung a.k.a. Nosaj Thing.</p>\n<p>Laid back to the point of near-horizontality, and characterised by nothing so much as a pervading sense of warmth, this is a species of electronic music that finds soul and humanity within the machines - blood in the wires. If I could pick a record of 2015 to live inside, it might well be <em>Fated</em>. The cover image is a simple black &amp; white photo of Chung holding up a fork by the tines, a butter knife suspended from it at 6 o’clock, pulled by gravity and held by some quirk of magnetism. The album somehow feels the same: a long, suspended moment, slightly magical, in tune with chance. For whatever reason I think of this sub-category as liminal electronica - and, considering that that’s a musical genre that doesn’t exist outside of my head, Chung does a remarkable job of getting it just right.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-metric--pagans-in-vegas\">5. Metric — <em>Pagans in Vegas</em></h3>\n<p>This album’s a disappointment within the limited framework of comparison to its predecessor: the flawless <em>Synthetica</em> (2012). Still present are the sure-footedly executed balance of pop sensibilities and underlying electro menace, the flawless understanding of what a key-change or lyrical twist can accomplish, and the sense of a band exploring every corner of their alt-electro-synth-pop palate.</p>\n<p>When the pace dipped I found myself losing interest just a little — something that never happened throughout <em>Synthetica</em> — and overall the quality is merely outstanding rather than genre-defining. There are exceptions: the effervescent ‘The Shade’, and the sly, shifting ’Cascades’ are every bit as good as I’d come to expect from Metric. In the final analysis this is a really solid continuation of the band’s sound, somewhat unfairly made to feel slight in comparison to a vastly superior previous album. And yet, these things must be put in context and this place in the top five is richly deserved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-toro-y-moi--what-for\">4. Toro y Moi — <em>What For?</em></h3>\n<p>This is an album possessed of both a distinct sense of the mood it wants to invoke, and also a sense of humour about the single-mindedness with which it sets about the task. Smart, effortlessly cool, and rendered with a fresh clarity, the soul influences are worn as a badge of honour whilst the mismatch of laid-back delivery and sometimes heavier content is endlessly compelling.</p>\n<p>The vocals are liberally treated with effects, but its done with such a holistic sense of the album’s sonic world that instead of risking distraction it instead echoes the warm distortion of the guitars, and serves to deepen the rich, swaying textures of the lower- tempo tracks. When the pace picks up on tracks like ‘Empty Nesters’ it takes the edge off the more cutting lyrics (“Call Mom &amp; Dad because their nest is empty, and so are you”) and keeps the mood light. Aaron Gold’s drums perform the same trick throughout, keeping things light and moving swiftly.</p>\n<p>The record’s finest moment comes in the shape of ‘Spell It Out’: a three-minute sideswipe that comes off like a simultaneous slap and kiss to the cheek.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-grimes--art-angels\">3. Grimes — <em>Art Angels</em></h3>\n<p>Rumour has it that after the unexpected level of attention garnered by 2012’s <em>Visions</em>, Clare Boucher made an album’s worth of material — including ill-conceived single release ’Go’ — before scrapping the whole thing and starting again. If true it’s perhaps indicative of how seriously Boucher sees the task of representing herself truthfully through her art in the glare of intensified media interest.</p>\n<p>She starts, simply, on the introductory ‘Laughing and Not Being Normal’, by reminding us that she has a spectacular voice, sometimes overlooked in commentary that focusses on her layering techniques and beat-making. From there she progresses into the achingly-beautiful ‘California’, which contains perhaps Grimes’s clearest method statement: &ldquo;I love this music / It sounds just like my soul&rdquo;. And so unfolds a record democratic in its tastes, eclectic in its tone and tempo, and yet singularly focussed on the task of pure artistic expression. Whatever reception the release received it seems clear that the most important thing to the artist here was making a record she was happy with. And so she indulges every whim for the duration that it retains her attention: sweetness, savagery, choral melody, multi-layered spiral-staircase beats&hellip; and on.</p>\n<p>‘Kill V. Maim’ is the album’s centrepiece, a crucible for all this particularly brilliant form of compositional madness, and — by some miracle — one of the best synth-pop anthems since Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em> five years ago.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-sleater-kinney--no-cities-to-love\">2. Sleater-Kinney — <em>No Cities to Love</em></h3>\n<p>Where did this come from?</p>\n<p>I had a slight familiarity with S-K’s previous album: <em>The Woods</em> (2005), but that was a decade ago, and prior to that — in the pre-streaming / pre-download era — they’d never really crossed my radar other than as mentions in articles analysing the impact of grunge, listed alongside Belly and Sonic Youth, and a dozen other bands I never really connected with for whatever reason. So it comes as something of a surprise that I fell so hard for this album, having tuned in after hearing it compared to Wild Flag’s 2011 debut. (It’s pretty funny how clearly I had that influence the wrong way around.)\nReleased not three weeks into the year it was immediately obvious that this album would stick around for a place on The List. ‘Price Tag’ might be the best opening track of any album this year, and like ‘Surface Envy’, ‘A New Wave’ and&hellip; well, most of the album, it’s a ~3-minute masterpiece of concentrated energy driving forward a smart lyric. This collection of songs is near bursting at the seams with ideas, energy and new directionality; it’s possible that after 10 years away the three members of Sleater-Kinney came back together with so many ideas that <em>No Cities to Love</em> represents the finest 10 tracks of dozens recorded. Whatever the case, they’ve produced a near-perfect rock album with just the right levels of enthusiasm, menace, sadness, and empowering anger. The title track deserves special mention for balancing these elements particularly flawlessly, whilst showcasing the poppy lightness that keeps the whole record effervescing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-chvrches--every-open-eye\">1. Chvrches — <em>Every Open Eye</em></h3>\n<p>Chvrches’ debut album reached number 4 on my 2013 list and so it’s fitting that this record, which represents a simultaneous strengthening and deepening of their sound, claims a higher spot. In truth the top three here came together pretty late. With Sleater-Kinney having been in pole position since release in Jan, and the Grimes LP not arriving until fairly late in the year, there was a bunch of late-in-the-day shuffling going on.</p>\n<p><em>The Bones of What You Believe</em> was one of those records that I loved but which left me with questions as to how it would be followed up. The answer Chvrches have elected to go with — perhaps wisely — is to double down on what they’re indisputably great at: a propulsive strain of synth-pop, underpinned by a strong rhythm section, and shot through with a hint of darkness. Lauren Mayberry’s voice remains the band’s secret weapon: sometimes fragile-seeming and bruised, it is uniquely suited to making anthemic vocals feel tender and personal. It is not Hayley Williams’s absolute siren of a vocal style, but matches it for its ability to make the synaptic connection between head and heart.</p>\n<p>The album is near-flawless; even the questionable choice to leave vocals to Martin Doherty on &lsquo;High Enough to Carry You Over’ shifts the album temporarily into a slightly different tone, following which ‘Empty Threat’ (the record’s poppiest moment) feels something like the lifting of a headache or a low mood.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the album’s signal moment comes just over two minutes into ‘Clearest Blue’, when the tender build-up crescendos into a euphoric dance beat. Somehow the fact that it resembles nothing more closely than The Pet Shop Boys does nothing to dilute the sheer joy of it.</p>\n<p>It’s telling that album number two has pushed Chvrches straight to the top of my list of acts to see live ASAP. Bright, sweet, imbued with boundless energy, and yet knowing and highly polished, this record is a confection but one over which I carry no guilt for adoring.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. The Necks — *Vertigo*\n\nKicked off in 2006 when I fell hard for *Chemist*, and continuing through a dalliance with the peerless *Silverwater* (2009) as well as an [unforgettable Barbican live performance](/neckslive), my love affair with The Necks continues. There have been a few releases in between, but the 44 minutes of *Vertigo’s* single track have been the first to stick firmly in my mind and find me consistently playing a Necks release in a little while.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the band’s sound this is exactly what you’d expect, and if you’re not it’s very difficult to describe. The tags you’d apply to it—’improvised’ & ‘jazz’ chief amongst them—are useful to a point, but not necessarily indicative of just how successfully this trio create a singular-feeling music: unrepeatable and yet entirely consistent in terms of the levels of interest and intrigue it sustains. All of which makes it even less palatable that I was in London on the final night of their Café Oto residency and did not manage to secure a ticket!\n\n###  19. Battles — *La Di Da Di*\n\nWhen the new Battles line-up dropped *Dross Glop* in 2012, five years on and one member down from the glorious debut *Mirrored* (2007) I was super-excited, and then — once the sugar rush had abated — a little disappointed with the result. The album had its moments, but the loss of Tyondai Braxton was notable (indeed, in retrospect, Braxton’s solo album *Central Market* (2009) was the stronger post-*Mirrored* output). It’s gratifying then to find Battles, a couple of years into the new lineup, genuinely returned to their full strength. Opener here ‘The Yabba’ (the track titles make as little sense as ever) is as strong as anything on the debut; both ‘Dot Net’ and ‘FF Bada’ repurpose drum patterns familiar from that first record but find new and inventive ways to use them - woven in with an instrumental palate that has the strange honour of now feeling totally familiar as well as distinctly off-kilter.\n\nThere’s certainly the odd moment when you wonder whether a line has been crossed (such as on the impenetrable opening minute of 'Tricentennial’) but those can be waived in light of how good it is to hear this band back to their endlessly inventive best.\n\n###  18. Florence + The Machine — *How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful*\n\nI haven’t paid all that much attention to Florence Welch since debut album *Lungs* arrived alongside debuts from Little Boots & La Roux in 2009. It was ‘Bulletproof’ & ‘In For The Kill’ from the latter that stuck with me that year, and then all three artists kind of faded from view for me.\n\nAfter an underwhelming return by La Roux last year, it comes as a welcome surprise that F+TM’s record really got to me this time around. I read a review at the time that pointed out the symbolic importance of Welch’s facing forward on the album cover for the first time. And indeed this does feel like a more directly addressed, more personal set of songs. Less obtuse, adorned with less in the way of theatrics, the record embraces naked emotionality as its throughline. There are certainly poetic flourishes to the lyrics, and the album isn’t without bombast (‘Queen of Peace’ rises and blooms like a firework display), but it feels somehow more personal than both the artist’s previous output and that of the majority of her contemporaries.\n\nIt should be mentioned also, that the 4-minute white rapids journey of opener ‘Ship to Wreck’ is quite possibly the best song I heard all year.\n\n###  17. Squarepusher — *Damogen Furies*\n\nOver a 20+ year career I’ve payed far too little attention to Squarepusher. The closest I got previously was a dip into 2010’s Shobaleader One: *d’Demonstrator* - itself a kind of spin-off album featuring an expanded lineup. *Damogen Furies* is my first exposure to Squarepusher-prime, and it’s left me a little shaken but thrilled and hungry for more. Comprising a host of somewhat raw-sounding electronica elements, settled in a bed of off-kilter, low wind instruments, or 16-bit era videogame chiptune soundscapes, the overall tone of the album is somewhere between menacing and schizophrenic — not dissimilar to Reznor’s OST for *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*.\n\nAt its most frenetic the drum patterning walks a line between highly measured and almost-freeform jazz, ricocheting all over the map and pulling the melodies into any number of new, convoluted forms. (One of my favourite examples of this is once ‘Baltang Ort’ gets past the 4.30 mark and loses its composure a bit; that last minute is insane.) It’s a remarkable achievement to make something so mechanical seem at the same time organic - responsive to shifts in the music’s mood.\n\n###  16. Will Butler — *Policy*\n\nWill Butler, here, has the same thing going for him as going against him: his membership of Arcade Fire. It’s doubtful — or at least significantly less likely — that I would have picked up this record without that background, and yet it comes freighted with a baggage that is entirely unfair. What Butler has produced is nothing more and nothing less than a collection of simple songs. Each one has an emotional directness familiar to listeners of his previous works, and they move between valences with aplomb. ‘Finish What I Started’ is a two-minute plea from the heart, and then it’s straight into ‘Son of God’: something close to an understated call for revolution.\n\nThere’s a smattering of multi-instrumentalism, but it sounds more like one man jumping from piano to keyboard to guitar, and less like the glorious, polychromatic racket that the collective of which he’s an integral part are capable of building. There’s also the nagging fact of how close Will’s voice is to that of brother Win. In a year without an Arcade Fire album this was a welcome dose of some watered-down substitute. That’s a very unfair thing to say about a pretty great album of alt-pop songs, but it was the feeling I couldn’t shake on the many occasions I listened to it. Sorry Will.\n\n###  15. Wolf Alice — *My Love is Cool*\n\nThe list of bands I listened to religiously in the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s that are obvious influences on Wolf Alice is long. And there’s no effort made to disguise that here, on an album that feels both a little familiar and oddly quaint in its delivery of a 20+ year old sound. Opener ‘Turn to Dust’ is as pretty as it is alluring, with just a hint of sadness enough to make you wonder what other colours the band will paint with. It’s the sort of effortless conjuring of mood that Laura Marling displayed time and again on her first couple of albums. When, after just over 3 minutes, the album shifts into ‘Bros’, the listener is assured that they’re in safe hands; I certainly didn’t hear a prettier straight-ahead, guitar-led pop song this year - so simple in its construction, yet executed beautifully enough to bring a tear to my eye on several listens.\n\nI’m left with questions about what the future holds for Wolf Alice: another collection of easygoing pop-rock singalongs that risks diminishing returns, or the temptation to risk something that may be outside their comfort zone? For now though, we have a really solid debut that does one thing very well indeed.\n\n###  14. Fort Romeau — *Insides*\n\nI’d made the decision before the start of the year to listen to every 2015 release that Ghostly International put out, so – even if this hadn’t come recommended by Kieran Hebden — I would have run across it eventually.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the man behind Four Tet likes what fellow Brit Mike Greene is doing here: it occupies largely the same space as Hebden’s own *Rounds* (2003): a kind of warm, comfortable, trancelike feeling somewhere between early morning tiredness and lazy sunbeam comfort. There are denser moments, such as the bass-driven ‘All I Want’, but they are swells upon an otherwise even-tempered expanse of musical ocean.\n\n(This ended up being my favourite eligible Ghostly release for the year, though Shigeto’s *Intermission* EP, would be way up there if it was a little longer than 6 tracks & ~20 minutes.)\n\n###  13. Ibeyi — *Ibeyi*\n\nThe two voices at the heart of Ibeyi’s self-titled debut are almost indistinguishable, belonging as they do to twins: Naomi & Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Both are light, playful, and soulful, painting flowing lines over beds of minimal piano and simple beats. At times they’re also haunting, used to great effect in mirroring or weaving in and out of each other, such as on album highlight ‘River’ where they hold a kind of conversation amid the waves of their own background harmonising.\n\nIt no doubt helps that I first heard this record when we were in Copenhagen in February, and it’s linked in my mind with a great week we spent out there. The album’s sonic warmth conjures for me, every time, the warmth of the apartment we were staying in, and to which we returned after days walking in biting cold.\n\n###  12. Nils Frahm — *Solo*\n\nIn much the same way that Ghostly International started to colonise great swathes of my listening time a couple of years ago, London-based label Erased Tapes have made a huge impact for me recently: I got a lot of listening out of Kiasmos’s self-titled LP last year; A Winged Victory for the Sullen provided me with an unforgettable live experience in a Danish church this February... and there’s another ET artist elsewhere on this list. Hence it’s fitting that I came to Frahm via labelmate Ólafur Arnalds, a kindred spirit and sometime collaborator (they put out an EP together this year actually, which — though ineligible for The List — is a recommended listen also).\n\nIn terms of the album itself — a collection of masterfully constructed piano pieces —there’s not too much to say. There is some variation: the slightness of ‘Chant’ and the swell of ‘Wall’, but the album is best considered of a piece, and the mood it evokes is singular. The *Pitchfork* review phrased it this way: \n\n> \"[I]t’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.” \n\nFor me, it was, easily. On several occasions this year it was precisely the record I needed, and to which I turned when nothing else would do.\n\n###  11. The Sidekicks — *Runners in the Nerved World*\n\nI’m not sure how I came to listen to this; a January release that has stuck around tenaciously to claim a spot on The List, and has done so by charm more than anything else. Touchstones here are bands like The Shins and Saves the Day, and this record firmly filled the same spot this year as Local Natives’ *Hummingbird* a couple of years ago: the best example that happened to cross into my awareness of a musical style far more prevalent on these lists in the early 2000s and appearing with increasing rarity since. Nevertheless this is the real thing and faithfully delivered. Steve Ciolek’s voice is an empathetic through-line with a range between falsetto fragility and convincing moments of emotional conviction.\n\n'Blissfield, MI’ is the record’s high point, though its driving bravado is something of an outlier on an album primarily comprising prettier pop-rock. The track also contains the album’s best lyric; the kind of glimpse into personal emotional-geography that late ‘90s / early ’00s emo at its best did so well:\n\n> I feel like how the Bulls felt in 1993  \n> I feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me\n\n###  10. Shamir — *Ratchet*\n\nAnother debut album for The List, and another distinct vocal - Shamir Bailey’s performance is by turns fragile (in the manner of a Michael Jackson ballad), cocky, or occasionally fierce. Low-key opener ‘Vegas’ keys the listener into a couple of the record’s themes — sin, pleasure — but is quickly undercut in a piece of genius sequencing by ‘Make A Scene’: a none-more-pop chant littered with unidentifiable sound effects, something that sounds distinctly like cow-bell, and a vaulting laser effect that draws the listener’s ear up and over Bailey’s falsetto.\n\nThere are plenty of catchy — if insubstantial — pleasures on offer, but the best track on the album is inarguably ‘On The Regular’, also probably 2015’s most infectious song. Its blend of lightness, self-assurance, and touches of thematic darkness are a good microcosm of the album in general. In the final analysis though, it was Shamir’s ear for a hook and the wit of his lyrics that brought me back to this time and again.\n\n###  9. Purity Ring — *Another Eternity*\n\nFor whatever reason Purity Ring’s debut (*Shrines* (2012)) didn’t make it onto my radar, and my introduction to the band came when I asked Siri to identify a song which turned out to be ‘Bodyache’ in a coffee shop this summer. Not long after that I was hooked on an album delicately balancing bright, dense synths and a similarly-toned female vocal. There are a few rhythm & blues touches here and there (the cadence of ‘Repetition’ for example), but it’s one influence among a spectrum, all blended here amongst warm synth-swaths to produce an album it’s easy to submerge yourself in and not want to emerge from.\n\nThere’s nothing even slightly revolutionary here, but it’s an album — like Metric’s *Synthetica* (2012) and SBTRKT’s *Wonder Where We Land* (2014) — that builds a cohesive and vibrant world of sound that pulled me in and kept me entranced.\n\n###  8. Jamie xx — *In Colour*\n\nThere’s something very smart about Jamie xx’s marking this solo release by calling out in the title (and album cover) the contrast to The xx’s predominantly monochrome aesthetic. That relationship is carried through to the music also, with the record feeling more expansive, more energetic, and wider-ranging than the (superb) work Jamie’s put out alongside Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim. Touching on the same positive-vibes club scene sound as Four Tet’s recent output, the record moves at a pace and imparts a real warmth without ever moving much beyond third gear.\n\nOpener ‘Gosh’ is a cheeky statement of intent. ’Stranger in a Room’ is night-driving music; traffic-lights refracted through rain music - cool in tone and soporific. ‘Hold Tight’ is a helter-skelter, hypnotic headphone trip. ’Obvs’ even manages to make good use of one of my least-favourite instruments: the steel drum.\n\nI got a real kick out of this collection of assorted brighter, club-electronica sounds, and it’s left me even more excited for a third LP from The xx in 2016.\n\n###  7. Rival Consoles — *Howl*\n\nAnd here’s that other member of the Erased Tapes roster alluded to earlier. Ryan Lee West’s set of constantly shifting soundscapes put a spell on me this year. As with Squarepusher earlier in this list, this is electronic music engaged in the exploration of what happens when a pattern is disrupted, complicated, and altered. Not as fraught as the music on *Damogen Furies*, but just as restless, this is an album for headphones not just because of its density and intricacy, but also because of its propulsiveness. It’s music to walk to, run to, and ride rails to.\n\nEach track is distinct, none outstay their welcome, and West knows when he’s stretched a beat to its breaking point, and thus when to move on. There’s a melancholy to some of the album’s lower tones, but elsewhere there’s a playfulness, and energy to spare (such as displayed by the shuffling brush-played drums underneath album highlight ‘Low’). Closing track ‘Looming’ is perhaps the collection’s tightest package; the euphoric shivers of synth that run through it ringing out like harbingers of a sunrise.\n\n###  6. Nosaj Thing — *Fated*\n\nThere’s a tone and a tempo of electronica that I’ve been continuously hunting since Flying Lotus’s *Cosmogramma* put me under its spell in 2010. Shigeto’s *No Better Time Than Now* satisfied the itch in 2013, and last year the role was played by Submerse’s *Slow Waves*; in 2015 the honour goes to the third record by Jason Chung a.k.a. Nosaj Thing.\n\nLaid back to the point of near-horizontality, and characterised by nothing so much as a pervading sense of warmth, this is a species of electronic music that finds soul and humanity within the machines - blood in the wires. If I could pick a record of 2015 to live inside, it might well be *Fated*. The cover image is a simple black & white photo of Chung holding up a fork by the tines, a butter knife suspended from it at 6 o’clock, pulled by gravity and held by some quirk of magnetism. The album somehow feels the same: a long, suspended moment, slightly magical, in tune with chance. For whatever reason I think of this sub-category as liminal electronica - and, considering that that’s a musical genre that doesn’t exist outside of my head, Chung does a remarkable job of getting it just right.\n\n### 5. Metric — *Pagans in Vegas*\n\nThis album’s a disappointment within the limited framework of comparison to its predecessor: the flawless *Synthetica* (2012). Still present are the sure-footedly executed balance of pop sensibilities and underlying electro menace, the flawless understanding of what a key-change or lyrical twist can accomplish, and the sense of a band exploring every corner of their alt-electro-synth-pop palate.\n\nWhen the pace dipped I found myself losing interest just a little — something that never happened throughout *Synthetica* — and overall the quality is merely outstanding rather than genre-defining. There are exceptions: the effervescent ‘The Shade’, and the sly, shifting ’Cascades’ are every bit as good as I’d come to expect from Metric. In the final analysis this is a really solid continuation of the band’s sound, somewhat unfairly made to feel slight in comparison to a vastly superior previous album. And yet, these things must be put in context and this place in the top five is richly deserved.\n \n###  4. Toro y Moi — *What For?*\n\nThis is an album possessed of both a distinct sense of the mood it wants to invoke, and also a sense of humour about the single-mindedness with which it sets about the task. Smart, effortlessly cool, and rendered with a fresh clarity, the soul influences are worn as a badge of honour whilst the mismatch of laid-back delivery and sometimes heavier content is endlessly compelling.\n\nThe vocals are liberally treated with effects, but its done with such a holistic sense of the album’s sonic world that instead of risking distraction it instead echoes the warm distortion of the guitars, and serves to deepen the rich, swaying textures of the lower- tempo tracks. When the pace picks up on tracks like ‘Empty Nesters’ it takes the edge off the more cutting lyrics (“Call Mom & Dad because their nest is empty, and so are you”) and keeps the mood light. Aaron Gold’s drums perform the same trick throughout, keeping things light and moving swiftly.\n\nThe record’s finest moment comes in the shape of ‘Spell It Out’: a three-minute sideswipe that comes off like a simultaneous slap and kiss to the cheek.\n\n###  3. Grimes — *Art Angels*\n\nRumour has it that after the unexpected level of attention garnered by 2012’s *Visions*, Clare Boucher made an album’s worth of material — including ill-conceived single release ’Go’ — before scrapping the whole thing and starting again. If true it’s perhaps indicative of how seriously Boucher sees the task of representing herself truthfully through her art in the glare of intensified media interest.\n\nShe starts, simply, on the introductory ‘Laughing and Not Being Normal’, by reminding us that she has a spectacular voice, sometimes overlooked in commentary that focusses on her layering techniques and beat-making. From there she progresses into the achingly-beautiful ‘California’, which contains perhaps Grimes’s clearest method statement: \"I love this music / It sounds just like my soul\". And so unfolds a record democratic in its tastes, eclectic in its tone and tempo, and yet singularly focussed on the task of pure artistic expression. Whatever reception the release received it seems clear that the most important thing to the artist here was making a record she was happy with. And so she indulges every whim for the duration that it retains her attention: sweetness, savagery, choral melody, multi-layered spiral-staircase beats... and on.\n\n‘Kill V. Maim’ is the album’s centrepiece, a crucible for all this particularly brilliant form of compositional madness, and — by some miracle — one of the best synth-pop anthems since Robyn’s *Body Talk* five years ago.\n\n###  2. Sleater-Kinney — *No Cities to Love*\n\nWhere did this come from?\n\nI had a slight familiarity with S-K’s previous album: *The Woods* (2005), but that was a decade ago, and prior to that — in the pre-streaming / pre-download era — they’d never really crossed my radar other than as mentions in articles analysing the impact of grunge, listed alongside Belly and Sonic Youth, and a dozen other bands I never really connected with for whatever reason. So it comes as something of a surprise that I fell so hard for this album, having tuned in after hearing it compared to Wild Flag’s 2011 debut. (It’s pretty funny how clearly I had that influence the wrong way around.)\nReleased not three weeks into the year it was immediately obvious that this album would stick around for a place on The List. ‘Price Tag’ might be the best opening track of any album this year, and like ‘Surface Envy’, ‘A New Wave’ and... well, most of the album, it’s a ~3-minute masterpiece of concentrated energy driving forward a smart lyric. This collection of songs is near bursting at the seams with ideas, energy and new directionality; it’s possible that after 10 years away the three members of Sleater-Kinney came back together with so many ideas that *No Cities to Love* represents the finest 10 tracks of dozens recorded. Whatever the case, they’ve produced a near-perfect rock album with just the right levels of enthusiasm, menace, sadness, and empowering anger. The title track deserves special mention for balancing these elements particularly flawlessly, whilst showcasing the poppy lightness that keeps the whole record effervescing.\n\n###  1. Chvrches — *Every Open Eye*\n\nChvrches’ debut album reached number 4 on my 2013 list and so it’s fitting that this record, which represents a simultaneous strengthening and deepening of their sound, claims a higher spot. In truth the top three here came together pretty late. With Sleater-Kinney having been in pole position since release in Jan, and the Grimes LP not arriving until fairly late in the year, there was a bunch of late-in-the-day shuffling going on.\n\n*The Bones of What You Believe* was one of those records that I loved but which left me with questions as to how it would be followed up. The answer Chvrches have elected to go with — perhaps wisely — is to double down on what they’re indisputably great at: a propulsive strain of synth-pop, underpinned by a strong rhythm section, and shot through with a hint of darkness. Lauren Mayberry’s voice remains the band’s secret weapon: sometimes fragile-seeming and bruised, it is uniquely suited to making anthemic vocals feel tender and personal. It is not Hayley Williams’s absolute siren of a vocal style, but matches it for its ability to make the synaptic connection between head and heart.\n\nThe album is near-flawless; even the questionable choice to leave vocals to Martin Doherty on 'High Enough to Carry You Over’ shifts the album temporarily into a slightly different tone, following which ‘Empty Threat’ (the record’s poppiest moment) feels something like the lifting of a headache or a low mood.\n\nPerhaps the album’s signal moment comes just over two minutes into ‘Clearest Blue’, when the tender build-up crescendos into a euphoric dance beat. Somehow the fact that it resembles nothing more closely than The Pet Shop Boys does nothing to dilute the sheer joy of it.\n\nIt’s telling that album number two has pushed Chvrches straight to the top of my list of acts to see live ASAP. Bright, sweet, imbued with boundless energy, and yet knowing and highly polished, this record is a confection but one over which I carry no guilt for adoring.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

As it was I literally didn’t know if I would be able to complete the course. That was what I found myself contending with about half way through. The toughest part was somewhere around 15 miles in: I started to feel nauseated, lightheaded as though I might pass out, and like running was the <em>absolute</em> last thing I wanted to be doing. I thought quite clearly at that point that not only didn’t I <em>want</em> to finish the marathon, but I <em>could&rsquo;nt</em> do it. I remember thinking what a shame it was that all of the training had been for nothing. That was the first point at which I stopped to walk for a minute, and I managed to talk myself around. I switched isotonic drinks for water to calm my stomach, and switched my music off for a bit as it felt weirdly as though I didn’t have the mental capacity to process lyrics and melody as well as concentrate on running.</p>\n<p>I honestly don’t know how I got through the next 4 or 5 miles. I remember hitting mile 18 knowing that was where Elizabeth&rsquo;s family were watching from, and I amused myself momentarily by thwanging my sweat-soaked hat at her brother as I passed. Then I just kept going… and kept going. I ran as much as I could, walked occasionally when I couldn’t, and rode the highs and lows. Somewhere around mile 21, after walking for a couple of minutes, Kanye West’s ‘Black Skinhead’ came on shuffle in my headphones and I set my fastest kilometre of the race. I don’t know the psychology behind that, but I recall being amazed that my legs were still physically capable of what they were doing as I zipped past dozens of other tired runners. I actually had to make an effort to ease up for fear that my knees would just suddenly give out - I remembered clearly how I’d felt after similarly thrashing out the final 2 miles of the <a href=\"/halfmarathon\">Dartford half marathon</a> a few weeks before.</p>\n<p>Another fortuitous musical moment came when My Chemical Romance’s ‘Bulletproof Heart’ began as I reached The Mall and entered the final 800m. It had been my unofficial anthem throughout the months of training, and I very nearly cried to hear it at that point. I stepped up the pace with a big grin when I wasn’t singing it to myself. The song ended with ~25m of the race to go, and I crossed the line to the opening strains of Elton John’s ‘I’m Still Standing’, which seemed appropriately joyful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/78b8577dce.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The whole process of collecting medals, meeting up with Elizabeth, and getting the train home all happened in an achey kind of blur.

I couldn’t find a position where my legs didn’t throb and ache, and my heart was thrumming and racing, possibly from dehydration. There’s a lot of thinking to be done about whether I’d ever do that again, and it still seems foreign to be able to say that I’ve completed a marathon. But there it is. Along with my MA this will be one of the major things I remember when I look back at my early 30s.</p>\n",

The toughest part was somewhere around 15 miles in: I started to feel nauseated, lightheaded as though I might pass out, and like running was the *absolute* last thing I wanted to be doing. I thought quite clearly at that point that not only didn’t I *want* to finish the marathon, but I *could'nt* do it. I remember thinking what a shame it was that all of the training had been for nothing. That was the first point at which I stopped to walk for a minute, and I managed to talk myself around. I switched isotonic drinks for water to calm my stomach, and switched my music off for a bit as it felt weirdly as though I didn’t have the mental capacity to process lyrics and melody as well as concentrate on running.\n\nI honestly don’t know how I got through the next 4 or 5 miles. I remember hitting mile 18 knowing that was where Elizabeth's family were watching from, and I amused myself momentarily by thwanging my sweat-soaked hat at her brother as I passed. Then I just kept going… and kept going. I ran as much as I could, walked occasionally when I couldn’t, and rode the highs and lows. Somewhere around mile 21, after walking for a couple of minutes, Kanye West’s ‘Black Skinhead’ came on shuffle in my headphones and I set my fastest kilometre of the race. I don’t know the psychology behind that, but I recall being amazed that my legs were still physically capable of what they were doing as I zipped past dozens of other tired runners. I actually had to make an effort to ease up for fear that my knees would just suddenly give out - I remembered clearly how I’d felt after similarly thrashing out the final 2 miles of the [Dartford half marathon](/halfmarathon) a few weeks before.\n\nAnother fortuitous musical moment came when My Chemical Romance’s ‘Bulletproof Heart’ began as I reached The Mall and entered the final 800m. It had been my unofficial anthem throughout the months of training, and I very nearly cried to hear it at that point. I stepped up the pace with a big grin when I wasn’t singing it to myself. The song ended with ~25m of the race to go, and I crossed the line to the opening strains of Elton John’s ‘I’m Still Standing’, which seemed appropriately joyful.\n\n![](/uploads/2023/78b8577dce.png)\n\nThe whole process of collecting medals, meeting up with Elizabeth, and getting the train home all happened in an achey kind of blur. Then we showered, ordered pizza, and collapsed into bed before 9pm. \n\nIt turns out the night after a marathon you don’t sleep so well. I couldn’t find a position where my legs didn’t throb and ache, and my heart was thrumming and racing, possibly from dehydration. There’s a lot of thinking to be done about whether I’d ever do that again, and it still seems foreign to be able to say that I’ve completed a marathon. But there it is. Along with my MA this will be one of the major things I remember when I look back at my early 30s.\n",

To construct a narrative from largely declarative sentences, none of them long enough to break over two lines, demands a kind of discipline. Perhaps unavoidably, because of how the eye is drawn and how the language flows, the piece is quite propulsive. Nors exacerbates that by choosing to repeatedly start successive sentences with the same word. But within these constraints, she displays a great deal of tonal diversity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One shouldn’t hurt others unnecessarily.\nOne should above all be kind.\nMinna would rather not be anything but.\nMinna’s hardly anything but.\nThe email thunders through the ether toward Karin.\n<em>That’s as it should be</em>, thinks Minna.\nThe ether’s full of malicious messages.\nThe ether hums with break-ups and loss.\nThe ether is knives being thrown.\nThe ether is blood surging back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text moves from Minna’s point of view to comment on her inner monologue and shifts so often and so fluidly that it sometimes occupies a position not readily identifiable to the reader.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Minna and Jette sit <em>sans camouflage</em> in the midst of it all.\nJette’s eyes are insistent.\nMinna has a hard time relaxing.\nThe legs biking.\nThe arms warding off blows.\nThe body full of vim.\nThe soul supposed to sit still.\nIt ain’t easy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the bulk of <em>Minna Needs Rehearsal Space</em> in two large gulps. Partly because the text makes it so easy to slip into its stream and get pulled along, but also because it felt that at any one point I was learning something about the central character—either by revelation or inference—that reframed my understanding of the narrative, whilst drawing me forward to discover more.

Luckily, there was one being staged 30 minutes away, around the outskirts of Dartford. This was the 39th running of the Dartford Half Marathon, and the first year in which the event had been moved from its previous summer slot to a cooler time of year.

Still, I was looking forward to the event. The previous three Sundays in the training plan had been beyond half marathon distance, with last Sunday being an 18 mile stretch that I’d found pretty punishing. I’d been having problems first with my right ankle and then — perhaps owing to overcompensating — my left knee, but the shorter runs during this week hadn’t posed any problems, and I felt good about the prospects of doing 13.1 miles at the pace I was aiming for — despite the hills.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, whilst doing a bit of final preparation — checking I had the details of the day straight in my mind etc. — I stumbled on an item in the FAQs that put a real kink in my race plans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In view of a raised awareness of the threat to safety… runners should not wear personal stereo equipment during this race.

The most important function, however, is to stop me thinking too much about the run. I have a terrible habit, left to my own devices, of constantly calculating the time elapsed vs. the likely time remaining; the pace of the previous mile and the pace of the present one, how they compare and what overall time would result from carrying on at one pace or altering up or down a gear.

What remains is another six weeks of slowly, steadily training my body to accept longer distances. Hopefully the ankle problem is truly behind me. Hopefully the knee will repair over the coming week and be stronger for it. Perhaps the most interesting thing I took from today was the idea that just maybe when I take my place at the start line in London on 26 April, I don’t necessarily need to have my earphones in.\n",

The first time I read the book it was as a fan of Murakami’s work, and over the last couple of weeks I’ve gone back through it as someone who is in training for their first marathon. It’s an odd book: a mix of autobiography, a kind of sports reportage, a little travel writing, and a healthy dose of something akin to philosophy. Murakami isn’t the kind of writer to present athletics in technicolour, super-sized with pomp and meaning; as with his fiction, he’s wonderful on the details: the rituals, the toll on the body, the workings of the mind during prolonged physical activity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void. But as you might expect, an occasional thought will slip into this void. People’s minds can’t be a complete blank. Human beings’ emotions are not strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum. What I mean is, the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as I run remain subordinate to that void. Lacking content, they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are my favourite passages of the book, when Murakami meditates on what running has meant to him — what it has taught him. Murakami is a pretty strong and highly experienced runner, whereas I am currently that most dangerous of things: an advanced beginner. I have no aspirations to match the times or distances that he outlines in the book, but I do find much of Murakami’s psychological approach admirable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I’m criticised unjustly (from my point of view, at least), or when someone I’m sure will understand me doesn’t, I go running for a little longer than usual. By running longer it’s like I can physically exhaust that portion of my discontent. It also makes me realize again how weak I am, how limited my abilities are. I become aware, physically, of these low points. And one of the results of running a little father than usual is that I become that much stronger. If I’m angry, I direct that anger toward myself. If I have a frustrating experience, I use that to improve myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Murakami gets close to something I have also found, expressing it more eloquently than I could. To be engaged in something as simple as running, and yet to be confronted by this simple act with concrete proof of your limitations, is humbling. In a very concrete way you are presented with evidence of your mortality, your relative weakness, and you learn something about yourself that feels solid and true.</p>\n<p>Writing from decades of experience as both a long-distance runner and the author of multiple lengthy novels, Murakami’s notes on concentrated effort and stamina have a ring of universality to them. As in his fiction it often seems that the simple object of his description is also being treated allegorically.

Built around the basis of Arnalds’s\nsweeping strings and intricate, sensitive piano patterns, the augmentation\nprovided here by synths and drum machines simply serves to lend another\ntexture to the sound. Sometimes there’s a switch to a pace Arnalds rarely\nachieves in his solo work, but the majority of this record poses no surprises.\nRegardless, I found myself enjoying this again and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-thom-yorke--tomorrows-modern-boxes\">18. Thom Yorke — <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em></h3>\n<p>Released by some unusual method — as is now the usual — and instantly\nfamiliar-feeling to anyone who listened to Radiohead’s <em>The King of Limbs</em> (2011)\nor Atoms for Peace’s <em>AMOK</em> (2013), <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em> is nevertheless\nanother fine set of glitchy, angsty, intricate clockworks wound up and let loose\nby a master craftsman and endlessly curious tinkerer. Particularly if you\nenjoyed the album versions of tracks from Yorke’s <em>The Eraser</em> (2006), before\nthey morphed and grew slightly when Atoms for Peace came on board to play them live, you’ll feel right at home with this understated collection of modest\nbut accomplished work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-east-india-youth--total-strife-forever\">17. East India Youth — <em>Total Strife Forever</em></h3>\n<p>A complete mystery to me upon first listen, William Doyle’s set of glittering,\nswimming electronica eventually coalesced into something I felt I could get my\nhands around. Conversely, I learned the best way to do that was simply to allow\nit to wash over me. The titular quartet could have been released as a standalone\nwork, but surrounding those tracks with more tonally-varied pieces really\nserves to bring them into relief as the spine of the album but not its flesh. I’m\nnot a huge fan of Doyle’s falsetto vocal (which creeps in a few times here and\nthere and is underwhelming rather than wholly off-putting), but his ear for the\nmelodic throughline to a complex miasma of sound is impressive throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-liars--mess\">16. Liars — <em>Mess</em></h3>\n<p>No two Liars albums are the same, and in the shape of <em>Mess</em> they’ve released\nperhaps their best since the career high of <em>Drum’s Not Dead</em> (2006). Opener\n‘Mask Maker’ seems like a deliberate attempt to forewarn the listener that\nthey’re in for a rough ride, but if one can learn to lean into the swings and take\nthe bumps there’s so much here to be infected by. The album’s best track ‘Mess\non a Mission’ is perhaps the band’s best to date, not to mention the best theme\ntune for a non-existent, Warren Ellis-scripted, True Detective-on-\namphetamines, HBO show I can imagine. Liars are talented at conjuring the\nsound of nightmares, and are not afraid of unleashing music that is at first\nseemingly incomprehensible. Learn to love it however, and you’ll find a lot to\nlove.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-tycho--awake\">15. Tycho — <em>Awake</em></h3>\n<p>I caught up with this album so, so late in the year and have a feeling that given\ntime to blossom in my mind it may float further up this list. Quickly my\nfavourite release on label-of-the-year contender Ghostly International, <em>Awake</em> is\na stunning collection of sur-ambient tracks that swell and sweep along lines\nthat quickly seem familiar and yet continue to grow in the mind with each\nlisten. I can foresee this being a record I return to for quite a while to come; I’m\nalready kicking myself a little for not picking it up upon release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-sisyphus--sisyphus\">14. Sisyphus — <em>Sisyphus</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not even sure how I came across this record — perhaps via the Son Lux\nconnection — but even on first listen I was fascinated by its variety and by how\nsingular so many of its elements felt. Opening track ‘Calm it Down’ is\ndoubtlessly one of my tracks of 2014, and Serengeti’s laid-back, self-assured\nflow was one of the discoveries of the year for me. The album as a whole is\nrestlessly inventive - constantly trying on new styles, sometimes two or three\nwithin the space of a single track: soul, hip-hop, R&amp;B, electronica - they’re all in\nthe mix here, and the combination was consistently alluring to me. My favourite\nmoment at the time of writing is on ‘Booty Call’: the delivery of the line “Im’a\nkiss you like a bubble in the brooks.” I don’t even need to know what that\nactually means.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-aphex-twin--syro\">13. Aphex Twin — <em>Syro</em></h3>\n<p>The last time Richard James put out an Aphex Twin album my interest in\nelectronic music was very slight, but even then I knew the name and something\nof the reputation. <em>Syro</em> appeared amongst much fanfare in September, and\nhasn’t moved far down my ‘recently played’ list since. I used the term ‘restlessly\ninventive’ above to describe Sisyphus’s melange of styles, but it applies here too;\nI don’t think any two bars of <em>Syro</em> are identical; things are always shifting,\ndifferent elements of a track taking momentary prominence and then being\nsubverted or switched out for some other stem. Four months hasn’t scratched\nthe surface of unlocking <em>Syro</em> in my mind, but there’s something special about a\nrecord that still feels ultimately unknowable after so much play.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-manic-street-preachers--futurology\">12. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Futurology</em></h3>\n<p>At this point in their career it’s a wonder that the Manics are still able to\nsurprise. But, whilst the vast majority of its component parts are drawn from\nelsewhere in their storied history, <em>Futurology</em> still manages to arrange the\nbuilding-blocks into some wonderful new shapes. Billed as a poppier\ncounterpart to last year’s <em>Rewind the Film</em> the album finds the band going\nstraight ahead on some tracks (’Sex, Power, Love and Money’, ‘Between the\nClock and the Bed’) but still finding plenty of room for introspection (‘Walk me\nto the Bridge’) and edgier-sounding fare. ‘The Next Jet to Leave Moscow’ could\nonly have been written by a band old enough to harbour regrets; their\nwillingness to spill them and work them through like this is admirable, and to our benefit. When the sums are totalled up this is the fourth in a run of great,\nand very different-feeling, albums from The Manics since 2009.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-caribou--our-love\">11. Caribou — <em>Our Love</em></h3>\n<p>After a while spent in its company <em>Our Love</em> resolves into a beautiful collection\nof bright, spacious electronica. I found myself returning to it as a default album\nfor lightening an afternoon, or to run to in the evenings. Perfectly paced,\nmeticulously crafted rhythms are brought to life by an inventive instrumental\npalate that kept me guessing until it crept into my head completely. Album\nhighlight ‘Second Chance’ takes a gamble on the kind of vocal that commonly\nrenders tracks skippable for me, but for some indiscernible reason here makes it\nthe song I returned to most often. That’s just one of a thousand impeccable\ndecisions made by Dan Snaith in his production of a record that took up root on\nthe brighter end of my electronica spectrum and stayed firmly planted through\nthe darker months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-the-acid--liminal\">10. The Acid — <em>Liminal</em></h3>\n<p>&lsquo;Liminal&rsquo; is one of my favourite words, and one I perhaps over-used in poetry\nseminars. It’s also a word I apply mentally to certain albums and pieces of\nmusic. Deftones’ <em>White Pony</em> (2000) feels that way to me, as does <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) for some reason. The Acid (of whom the only member I was previously\nfamiliar with is Adam Freeland) have chosen a good title for their debut LP\nhowever: the music on <em>Liminal</em> emerges and grows organically, fades, shifts,\nand evokes powerfully its own sense of place.</p>\n<p>‘Creeper’ is propulsive and straining at itself to break free. ‘Basic Instinct’ is\nunderstated and makes good use of the vocal effect the record’s production\nrelies on throughout to mask a relatively slight range. I found that with this\nrecord, perhaps because it is so successful in evoking a particular mood, I had to\nbe in the right mood to play it - but when that mood hit there was little better\nthan spending time inside the world it builds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-nothing--guilty-of-everything\">9. Nothing — <em>Guilty Of Everything</em></h3>\n<p>The closest stylistic analogue for what Nothing are doing on their debut is\nshoegaze, but various elements of their sound push at and perhaps tear the\nedges of that envelope. Whilst tracks like ‘Endlessly’ are firmly within the tradition of My Bloody Valentine et al, ‘Get Well’ is too rhythmic and danceable, and ‘Somersault’ is closer to something from Hope of the States’ <em>The Lost Riots</em>\n(2004).</p>\n<p>Regardless, the production of the record understands well what the band’s\nambition is: to flood the listener’s head with glorious, monochrome noise so\nthat they feel subsumed by and imbued with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-taylor-mcferrin--early-riser\">8. Taylor McFerrin — <em>Early Riser</em></h3>\n<p>For some reason I didn’t listen to much jazz this year (Otis Brown III’s <em>The\nThought of You</em> perhaps the best jazz qua jazz LP I spent any significant time\nwith), and even this is borderline. McFerrin’s modus operandi is to interweave\nsoulful, understated electronica through elements of jazz (‘4am’, ‘Already\nThere’), R&amp;B (‘The Antidote’), and back into soul itself (opener, and entrant on\nthe track-of-the-year shortlist, ‘Postpartum’). Something about the resulting\nmix (perhaps the way it moves seamlessly from one sound to another) really\nworked for me. On weekend mornings and walks into work it was a pleasure to\nbe accompanied by this album which, in all its forms, suffuses light and good\nfeeling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-2\">7. Run The Jewels — <em>Run The Jewels 2</em></h3>\n<p>Hip-hop didn’t come through for me this year either. The new Common album\ndidn’t get close to the hype, the long-awaited Wu Tang Clan LP had its moments\nbut was never going to be a classic, and the same goes for The Roots’ <em>…And\nThen You Shoot Your Cousin</em>. Kanye took a year off, Jay-Z took a year off, who\nknows if Yasiin Bey / Mos Def is working on anything?</p>\n<p>Anyway, all of which set the stage for something new and Run The Jewels took\nfull advantage. El-P is a decent rapper and a flat-out great beat-maker. With this\nrecord following up 2013’s <em>R.A.P. Music</em> Killer Mike is making a play for Kanye’s\ncrown, with a knack for twisted, quotable, clever lyrics and an incredible,\nrelaxed flow that drives the record.</p>\n<p>The album is obviously conceived as a whole - it wouldn’t surprise me to find\nthat El-P considered the sequencing as carefully as any individual beat. ‘Jeapordy’ comes with no warning, things build on ‘Oh My Darling Don’t Cry’ and when the beat drops on ‘Blockbuster Night Part 1’ I just about lose it each time. But then it goes up another level on ‘Close Your Eyes’, which also happens to feature Zach de la Rocha’s best verse since he stepped out for Saul Williams in 2004.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-the-new-pornographers--brill-bruisers\">6. The New Pornographers — <em>Brill Bruisers</em></h3>\n<p>I was a big fan of <em>Twin Cinema</em> (2005) but haven’t exactly flipped for the two\nNew Pornographers records between then and now. <em>Brill Bruisers</em>, however, is\nan unqualified triumph. The opening track is bombastic and sing-along whilst\nalso proving a great showcase for the band’s huge sound. I love the way\n‘Champions of Red Wine’ shimmers and builds, and ‘War on the East Coast’\npulls a bait and switch by flipping from dirge to glam in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>Carl Newman refers to Brill Bruisers as &ldquo;a celebration record&rdquo; and certainly it\nsticks to the brighter, more upbeat end of the band’s spectrum. The production\nis outstanding, and having several male and female vocalists allows for a\ndialogue and a lyrical dynamic that works here as it does for Arcade Fire. Take\nfor example album best ‘Born With A Sound’, which could easily find a home on\n<em>The Suburbs</em>: when Amber Webber sings “I want you all of the time” by herself a\nshiver runs through me without fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-submerse--slow-waves\">5. Submerse — <em>Slow Waves</em></h3>\n<p>With the majority of what I listen to these days falling somewhere on the\nelectronica spectrum, Submerse managed to pinpoint precisely where my head\nis with this stuff at the moment. Lushly-produced, infinitely warm\nsoundscapes, and wonderfully balanced instrumentation helped make this\nprobably my most-played album of 2014.</p>\n<p>Other plaudits headed <em>Slow Waves’s</em> way include best album cover of the year\nand best opening track in the form of the stunning ’Let’s Never Come Back Here\nAgain’. Other highlights include the alluring wash of ‘Snorlax’ and ‘VHS.chords’,\nwhich weaves circa–8-bit videogame sound effects subtly through its ebb and\nflow. I’ve been struggling to pinpoint precisely what it is that Rob Orme (aka\nSubmerse) does so well, and I think the key to this sound is the perfect balance\nof organic-seeming electronica: there’s nothing cold here, it all feels very much\nas though each of its musical capillaries is pulsing with warmth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-spoon--they-want-my-soul\">4. Spoon — <em>They Want My Soul</em></h3>\n<p>The narrative around the release of this record was all too concerned with the\nlongevity of the band’s career. As someone with — for better or worse — limited prior\nconnection with Spoon, I was able to look at the album objectively and found it\nto be nothing less or more complicated than a great rock record.</p>\n<p>It’s a cleverly sequenced album: ‘Rent I Pay’ is a statement of intent to open\nwith, ‘Inside Out’ is more ruminative, slightly poppier, and ‘Rainy Taxi’ serves\nto display a cutting edge. Most of these 10 tracks move between moods\nthroughout their runtime, as though the band have too many great ideas for one\nalbum. Nothing feels forced or poorly-executed however - it’s clear without\nknowing the back catalogue that this is a group of musicians very assured in\nwhat they’re making.</p>\n<p>The warm, just-fuzzy-enough production is outstanding, and is tweaked\nmasterfully to fit around each song just perfectly. I’ll be playing the title track\nand the bombastic, anthem to bravery ’Let Me Be Mine’ for a long while to come - as well as most of the rest of the album I should think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-sbtrkt--wonder-where-well-land\">3. SBTRKT — <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em></h3>\n<p>Previous to this year my only knowledge of SBTRKT was via a couple of (pretty\ngreat) Radiohead remixes (of ‘Everything In Its Right Place’ &amp; ‘Lotus Flower’).\nThe path to changing that was an odd one: I picked up the single ’NEW DORP.\nNEW YORK’ via Ezra Koenig’s Twitter, and liked but didn’t love it. That was\nenough to get me to tune into the album via Rdio, and soon after I had\npurchased it and was playing a couple of tracks more-or-less daily. There’s a\ngreat variety of styles on display over the generous 15 track running order, but I\nstarted to get even more out of the record when it clicked for me that it had been\nbuilt for consumption as a whole.</p>\n<p>‘The Light’ sounds like it belongs on a sexier version of <em>Hail To The Thief</em>;\n’Temporary View’ — tinged with R&amp;B — is plaintive and uplifting; ‘Higher’\nfeatures Raury delivering probably my favourite hip-hop vocal performance of\nthe year.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason even the outlets I’m usually fairly in sync with on music\nwere relatively down on this record (Pitchfork: 55%; Resident Advisor: 5/10).\nThat’s a puzzle to me as I continue to find new reasons to love a huge, warm\nalbum in which it’s a pleasure to get lost for a while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-st-vincent--st-vincent\">2. St. Vincent — <em>St. Vincent</em></h3>\n<p>I really liked Annie Clark’s 2009 album <em>Actor</em>, but this record quickly inspired a\nwhole new level of devotion. That was the case right from the release of ‘Digital\nWitness’ on the sixth day of the year - a track I’m still playing regularly 12\nmonths later and have not grown the slightest bit tired of.</p>\n<p>‘Birth in Reverse’ is all angular guitar and too-deep grooves, ‘Bring Me Your\nLoves’ makes something astounding out of the under-practiced sub-genre of\nlament-as-anthem. But it’s ‘Digital Witness’ that still rings the clearest for me as\nthe album’s centrepiece: in tone and subject matter a kissing-cousin to much of\nArcade Fire’s <em>Reflektor</em>, and just as stirring to each the heart, head, and hips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-death-from-above-1979--the-physical-world\">1. Death From Above 1979 — <em>The Physical World</em></h3>\n<p>I still remember the day in 2006 when I read the post on DFA1979’s website in\nwhich Jesse Keller used those fateful words: “We decided to stop doing the\nband…”. That was two years after having released the singularly powerful <em>You’re\nA Woman, I’m A Machine</em> and thereby shifting my whole conception of how\nmuch noise two people could make, as well as altering the topography of the\npost-punk landscape.</p>\n<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of\nthis second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of\nthe first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve\nthe band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power\nis a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, a neat accompaniment to the album was also released this year in\nthe form of Eva Michon’s insightful, up-close-and-personal doc <em>Life After Death\nFrom Above 1979</em>, which chronicles the tour cycle of the first record, the falling\napart, and the reconstitution of the band.)</p>\n<p>‘Right On, Frankenstein!’ &amp; ‘The Physical World’ are my favourite tracks here,\nbut the whole thing is pretty outstanding from start to finish. Brutal, danceable,\nchantable, and full of great hooks - I couldn’t be happier to have DFA1979 back\nin the world.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Deru — *1979*\n\nI was introduced to Deru via his contributions to the *Outliers: Volume 1 - Iceland*\nproject, in which his minimalist electronic soundscapes provided the perfect\naccompaniment to long, languorous shots of Iceland’s stark landscapes. Over\nthe duration of an album the tone varies a little more, but retains a chill and a\nslight distance. I kept returning to this record to be present with it, simply\nbecause I like the colours it paints with and the patience with which it unfolds.\n\n###  19. Kiasmos — *Kiasmos*\n\nBilled as Ólafur Arnalds’s electronica side-project, Kiasmos sounds pretty much\nas that description would lead you to believe.

The New Pornographers — *Brill Bruisers*\n\nI was a big fan of *Twin Cinema* (2005) but haven’t exactly flipped for the two\nNew Pornographers records between then and now. *Brill Bruisers*, however, is\nan unqualified triumph. The opening track is bombastic and sing-along whilst\nalso proving a great showcase for the band’s huge sound. I love the way\n‘Champions of Red Wine’ shimmers and builds, and ‘War on the East Coast’\npulls a bait and switch by flipping from dirge to glam in the blink of an eye.\n\nCarl Newman refers to Brill Bruisers as \"a celebration record\" and certainly it\nsticks to the brighter, more upbeat end of the band’s spectrum. The production\nis outstanding, and having several male and female vocalists allows for a\ndialogue and a lyrical dynamic that works here as it does for Arcade Fire. Take\nfor example album best ‘Born With A Sound’, which could easily find a home on\n*The Suburbs*: when Amber Webber sings “I want you all of the time” by herself a\nshiver runs through me without fail.\n\n###  5. Submerse — *Slow Waves*\n\nWith the majority of what I listen to these days falling somewhere on the\nelectronica spectrum, Submerse managed to pinpoint precisely where my head\nis with this stuff at the moment. Lushly-produced, infinitely warm\nsoundscapes, and wonderfully balanced instrumentation helped make this\nprobably my most-played album of 2014.\n\nOther plaudits headed *Slow Waves’s* way include best album cover of the year\nand best opening track in the form of the stunning ’Let’s Never Come Back Here\nAgain’. Other highlights include the alluring wash of ‘Snorlax’ and ‘VHS.chords’,\nwhich weaves circa–8-bit videogame sound effects subtly through its ebb and\nflow. I’ve been struggling to pinpoint precisely what it is that Rob Orme (aka\nSubmerse) does so well, and I think the key to this sound is the perfect balance\nof organic-seeming electronica: there’s nothing cold here, it all feels very much\nas though each of its musical capillaries is pulsing with warmth.\n\n###  4. Spoon — *They Want My Soul*\n\nThe narrative around the release of this record was all too concerned with the\nlongevity of the band’s career. As someone with — for better or worse — limited prior\nconnection with Spoon, I was able to look at the album objectively and found it\nto be nothing less or more complicated than a great rock record.\n\nIt’s a cleverly sequenced album: ‘Rent I Pay’ is a statement of intent to open\nwith, ‘Inside Out’ is more ruminative, slightly poppier, and ‘Rainy Taxi’ serves\nto display a cutting edge. Most of these 10 tracks move between moods\nthroughout their runtime, as though the band have too many great ideas for one\nalbum. Nothing feels forced or poorly-executed however - it’s clear without\nknowing the back catalogue that this is a group of musicians very assured in\nwhat they’re making.\n\nThe warm, just-fuzzy-enough production is outstanding, and is tweaked\nmasterfully to fit around each song just perfectly. I’ll be playing the title track\nand the bombastic, anthem to bravery ’Let Me Be Mine’ for a long while to come - as well as most of the rest of the album I should think.\n\n### 3. SBTRKT — *Wonder Where We’ll Land*\n\nPrevious to this year my only knowledge of SBTRKT was via a couple of (pretty\ngreat) Radiohead remixes (of ‘Everything In Its Right Place’ & ‘Lotus Flower’).\nThe path to changing that was an odd one: I picked up the single ’NEW DORP.\nNEW YORK’ via Ezra Koenig’s Twitter, and liked but didn’t love it. That was\nenough to get me to tune into the album via Rdio, and soon after I had\npurchased it and was playing a couple of tracks more-or-less daily. There’s a\ngreat variety of styles on display over the generous 15 track running order, but I\nstarted to get even more out of the record when it clicked for me that it had been\nbuilt for consumption as a whole.\n\n‘The Light’ sounds like it belongs on a sexier version of *Hail To The Thief*;\n’Temporary View’ — tinged with R&B — is plaintive and uplifting; ‘Higher’\nfeatures Raury delivering probably my favourite hip-hop vocal performance of\nthe year.\n\nFor whatever reason even the outlets I’m usually fairly in sync with on music\nwere relatively down on this record (Pitchfork: 55%; Resident Advisor: 5/10).\nThat’s a puzzle to me as I continue to find new reasons to love a huge, warm\nalbum in which it’s a pleasure to get lost for a while.\n\n###  2. St. Vincent — *St. Vincent*\n\nI really liked Annie Clark’s 2009 album *Actor*, but this record quickly inspired a\nwhole new level of devotion. That was the case right from the release of ‘Digital\nWitness’ on the sixth day of the year - a track I’m still playing regularly 12\nmonths later and have not grown the slightest bit tired of.\n\n‘Birth in Reverse’ is all angular guitar and too-deep grooves, ‘Bring Me Your\nLoves’ makes something astounding out of the under-practiced sub-genre of\nlament-as-anthem. But it’s ‘Digital Witness’ that still rings the clearest for me as\nthe album’s centrepiece: in tone and subject matter a kissing-cousin to much of\nArcade Fire’s *Reflektor*, and just as stirring to each the heart, head, and hips.\n\n###  1. Death From Above 1979 — *The Physical World*\n\nI still remember the day in 2006 when I read the post on DFA1979’s website in\nwhich Jesse Keller used those fateful words: “We decided to stop doing the\nband…”. That was two years after having released the singularly powerful *You’re\nA Woman, I’m A Machine* and thereby shifting my whole conception of how\nmuch noise two people could make, as well as altering the topography of the\npost-punk landscape.\n\nIt’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of\nthis second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of\nthe first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve\nthe band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power\nis a kind of compound triptych miracle.\n\n(As an aside, a neat accompaniment to the album was also released this year in\nthe form of Eva Michon’s insightful, up-close-and-personal doc *Life After Death\nFrom Above 1979*, which chronicles the tour cycle of the first record, the falling\napart, and the reconstitution of the band.)\n\n‘Right On, Frankenstein!’ & ‘The Physical World’ are my favourite tracks here,\nbut the whole thing is pretty outstanding from start to finish. Brutal, danceable,\nchantable, and full of great hooks - I couldn’t be happier to have DFA1979 back\nin the world.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

I can’t help but wonder where those two are going, what the likelihood of their encountering each other again might be, just what exactly they are losing by passing by each other. Whilst Tomine’s graphic novel work is full of great characterisation and well-wrought narrative, his ability to capture emotionally resonant moments in single frames is often simply astounding.  Nowhere is this more elegantly done than in ‘Missed Connection’. \n\nPrints of the piece (along with many others) are for sale via [Tomine’s site](http://www.adrian-tomine.com/Prints.html), and more information on his catalogue can be found via his publisher: [Drawn & Quarterly](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/author/adrian-tomine).\n",

Having grown up asthmatic and bookish I spend most of my teens and even 20s eschewing pretty much all kinds of exercise where possible, and only laced up a pair of running shoes about three years ago.

After that it seemed like trying to break 30 minutes was an insurmountable barrier… until I did it. It’s still kind of shocking to me how quickly running 5K became just something I do a couple or three times a week. The next challenge was longer distances, and recently I broke the hour barrier for 10K.

But then, perhaps that’s how you’re supposed to feel with 200 days to go.

				"content_html": "<p>Time for far too many words of tech nerdery, as I put the two premiere &lsquo;read-it-later&rsquo; services head-to-head in order to determine which I should be using at present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"icon\">Icon</h3>\n<p>In the first instance, I place quite a lot of stock—perhaps too much—in how my iPhone’s home screen looks. The Pocket icon is pleasingly colourful and for whatever reason the hint at depth that plays along the lower edge doesn’t look out of place amidst the otherwise flat sensibility of iOS 7.</p>\n<p>The Instapaper icon has two weaknesses as far as my taste is concerned: firstly it’s black and white, so lets the side down a bit in terms of my home screen’s otherwise pretty colourful array, and secondly it features a prominent capital ‘I’ that (through some quirk of how my brain is wired) I cannot help but pronounce to myself, inwardly, every time I see it. (See also why I can’t have the Tumblr, Vine, or Medium apps on the front page.)</p>\n<p>I also quite dig that little Pocket icon, and enjoy seeing it on an extension in Safari, and appearing on tweets that feature links. Far more distinctive, in both cases, than a lone capital letter.</p>\n<p>So, so very subjective but this round goes to: <strong>Pocket</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"web-ui\">Web UI</h3>\n<p>The article list in Pocket doesn’t quite get things right for me in either of its available formats. The tile view looks good, in the majority of cases, for items that feature an image—though sometimes the auto-cropping makes things messy—but pure text items kind of drown and the snippet of text that’s applied as a descriptor is often nonsensical. The list view is similarly short of ideas as to what to do about items without an image, and settles for putting an ugly placeholder next to them. At least the applied tags are visible in the list view however, whereas they’re inexplicably hidden in the tile layout.</p>\n<p>The menus and iconography within the Pocket interface all err on the side of chunkiness. It’s all pretty clean, and the rounded human-sans type makes it seem friendly where Instapaper is more functional, but at times it feels a bit cumbersome - it allows itself too much space and feels inelegant for it. My biggest pet peeve is the occasional appearance of a big yellow button, clearly a hold over from the service’s previous incarnation as Read It Later, it just feels entirely out of place. I do, however, like the choice of a central menu that drops down from the logotype - it looks great and gives quick access to all of the service’s elements.</p>\n<p>Where Pocket is blocky and colourful, Instapaper is stark in black &amp; white and (particularly in the ‘Compact’ iteration I prefer) makes great, functional use of every centimetre of screen space. No clumsily auto-generated snippet text, no mis-cropped images, just a crisp and functional UI with a familiar sidebar element. Though I have come to prefer tagging to folders as an organising principle, the folder implementation of Instapaper works well enough with the one exception that I wish filed items still remained in ‘Archive’, keeping that as a universal list of read items.</p>\n<p>The iconography isn’t quite as good as Pocket’s, but it works, and the split between a sans serif face for UI items and a serif for content works exceptionally well. Perhaps Instapaper’s biggest advantage of all in this area though is the simple inclusion of an edit function. Allowing me to tweak an article title to my liking allows me to keep things nice and neat, especially important when archiving for future consultation.</p>\n<p>Hands down this goes to <strong>Instapaper</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"app-ui\">App UI</h3>\n<p>Pocket’s formatting of its item list is more forgivable within the apps, where the pictures are smaller and items that don’t have them do not look as out of place. The tags are visible too! The slide-out main menu looks great and works well and the iconography is strong enough to make the ‘swipe left and choose an icon’ school of actions work flawlessly. Perhaps it’s my feeble brain, but still when I attempt this move within the Instapaper app I occasionally mistake the ‘Folder’ icon for ‘Archive’, and the ‘Archive’ icon proper for a non-existent ‘Print’ function.</p>\n<p>In fact, Instapaper’s app UI is a backwards step, not allowing the ‘Compact’ view I prefer on the web, the mandatory couple of lines snipped from the body of the icon make things look busy and untidy. On iPad things are even worse: tile view is mandatory and personally I find it ugly as all heck.</p>\n<p>In terms of pure looks, <strong>Pocket</strong> has the upper hand on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reading-experience\">Reading experience</h3>\n<p>There’s really not much in this. On the web both services do a good job of delivering on their <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em>: they get out of the way and leave the screen to cleanly presented text. Pocket only features a binary choice with respect to typography: serif or sans-serif, but the sans that’s provided is pleasant enough on the eye, particularly on iOS. Instapaper has a slight upper hand by providing more options, including Lyon - perhaps my favourite face for longform, screen-based reading.</p>\n<p>It’s a slight shame that the header bar is always present when viewing Pocket content on the web, but equally irritating is the habit of Instapaper’s header to fade eye-catchingly back into view as soon as one scrolls up a few pixels. It’s a tie on that score.</p>\n<p>In fact overall it’s just about even, but I’ll give it to <strong>Instapaper</strong> by a nose just because Lyon is an option.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds\">Feeds</h3>\n<p>This is a tricky one for me because I’m unusually sensitive to the underlying relationships between these read-later apps and other parts of my workflow.</p>\n<p>Taking Instapaper first: the service is owned by Betaworks, who also operate the RSS reader service Digg Reader. To use one without the other seems counterintuitive to me, and yet Betaworks don’t make things easy. Perhaps hedging their bets they have retained a ‘save for later’ function within Digg Reader, as well as an Instapaper option. To further complicate things the option exists to automatically send to Instapaper any item that is marked to save for later. Not a huge deal perhaps, but it bugs me every time I encounter it and have to make a false choice.</p>\n<p>Feedly has been my RSS service of choice since the demise of Google Reader, and its pro version professes close ties to both Pocket and Evernote. That sounds like the sort of airtight setup that holds a lot of appeal to me, but the reality is a little underwhelming… (see below)</p>\n<p>In truth both Pocket &amp; Instapaper are fairly universal export options within most feed reading clients at this point, so it’s hard not to make this one <strong>a tie</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"note-taking--clipping\">Note-taking / clipping</h3>\n<p>Currently at least, Feedly &amp; Pocket’s vaunted close ties to Evernote extend exactly as far as the option to simply send the entire text of an article to a notebook of your choice. Ironically it’s Instapaper (not, to my knowledge, an Evernote ‘partner’) that has the more granular integration. With the recent addition of its ‘highlighting’ function, and the option to automatically send highlighted passages to Evernote, Instapaper makes for a very neat clipping tool. There’s still some tidying up to do on the Evernote end as each highlight comes through as a separate note regardless of whether several originate form the same item within Instapaper, but it’s a step in a very interesting direction and cuts out a bit of the work of having a separate app open into which to paste clipped passages.</p>\n<p>Pocket doesn’t have anything like this… so it’s really down to the user to provide their own solution. Which is why, <strong>Instapaper</strong> takes this round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bookmarking\">Bookmarking</h3>\n<p>With folders or tagging, both services offer a decent device for maintaining an archive of read material. Still, I use a bookmarking service (Pinboard) for interesting sites and content of various stripes, and it’s nice to be able to have select content that has passed through my read-later service also be stored there. Instapaper has a setting whereby any item that gets ‘Liked’ gets sent on to Pinboard. For the most part this works exceptionally well, with the slight exception that the entry in Pinboard is marked as private without any option to change this. The vast majority of my Pinboard content is public, which means a little bit of curation is still needed on my part once ‘Liked’ Instapaper items make their way over there. There’s also the choice to send any given item to Pinboard manually without the need to ‘Like’ it.</p>\n<p>Pocket doesn’t offer a solution to manually send items to Pinboard, or to automatically export ‘Favourite’ items. With a little <a href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->IFTTT<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> magic the latter can be replicated; there’s even the slight advantage of the item importing as public.</p>\n<p>Related to this is the question of storing a full-text archive copy of items. Pocket recently introduced this for all items for users with a Premium subscription at $5 per month. An alternative is Pinboard’s archiving service at $25 per year, which does the same thing, but obviously only on items sent to it by one of the routes outlined above.</p>\n<p>Again, there’s not much in this one but <strong>Instapaper</strong> edges it for the presence of an automatic <em>and</em> a manual solution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p><strong>Instapaper</strong> 4.5\n<strong>Pocket</strong> 2.5</p>\n<p>That scoreline looks more one-sided than this feels to me. The things that bug me about Instapaper (the icon, the item list on iOS) really bug me and the things I like about Pocket (the iconography, the ties with Feedly) I really like. However, in a few key areas Instapaper has the upper hand: the web UI is flawless; the typography is stronger across all platforms.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the main barrier to me fully embracing <em>Instapaper</em> as my read-later client of choice, is the extent to which I get hung up on the ideal of the holistic setup. If I’m using Instapaper it feels wrong to me not to be using Digg Reader as my RSS client, and that’s not a step I’m prepared to take. Likewise, if I’m to continue using Feedly for RSS, it feels like I should be utilising the other service it is most closely tied: Pocket (particularly as I’m a heavy user of the third piece of that touted puzzle: Evernote). I may consider switching my RSS to something like Feedbin to alleviate this, or I could try and get past it and embrace the decision to use the best tool for each particular job, regardless of who owns them.</p>\n",

To use one without the other seems counterintuitive to me, and yet Betaworks don’t make things easy. Perhaps hedging their bets they have retained a ‘save for later’ function within Digg Reader, as well as an Instapaper option. To further complicate things the option exists to automatically send to Instapaper any item that is marked to save for later. Not a huge deal perhaps, but it bugs me every time I encounter it and have to make a false choice. \n\nFeedly has been my RSS service of choice since the demise of Google Reader, and its pro version professes close ties to both Pocket and Evernote. That sounds like the sort of airtight setup that holds a lot of appeal to me, but the reality is a little underwhelming… (see below)\n\nIn truth both Pocket & Instapaper are fairly universal export options within most feed reading clients at this point, so it’s hard not to make this one **a tie**. \n\n### Note-taking / clipping\n\nCurrently at least, Feedly & Pocket’s vaunted close ties to Evernote extend exactly as far as the option to simply send the entire text of an article to a notebook of your choice. Ironically it’s Instapaper (not, to my knowledge, an Evernote ‘partner’) that has the more granular integration. With the recent addition of its ‘highlighting’ function, and the option to automatically send highlighted passages to Evernote, Instapaper makes for a very neat clipping tool. There’s still some tidying up to do on the Evernote end as each highlight comes through as a separate note regardless of whether several originate form the same item within Instapaper, but it’s a step in a very interesting direction and cuts out a bit of the work of having a separate app open into which to paste clipped passages. \n\nPocket doesn’t have anything like this… so it’s really down to the user to provide their own solution. Which is why, **Instapaper** takes this round. \n\n### Bookmarking\n\nWith folders or tagging, both services offer a decent device for maintaining an archive of read material. Still, I use a bookmarking service (Pinboard) for interesting sites and content of various stripes, and it’s nice to be able to have select content that has passed through my read-later service also be stored there. Instapaper has a setting whereby any item that gets ‘Liked’ gets sent on to Pinboard. For the most part this works exceptionally well, with the slight exception that the entry in Pinboard is marked as private without any option to change this. The vast majority of my Pinboard content is public, which means a little bit of curation is still needed on my part once ‘Liked’ Instapaper items make their way over there. There’s also the choice to send any given item to Pinboard manually without the need to ‘Like’ it. \n\nPocket doesn’t offer a solution to manually send items to Pinboard, or to automatically export ‘Favourite’ items. With a little [<sc>IFTTT</sc>](http://www.ifttt.com) magic the latter can be replicated; there’s even the slight advantage of the item importing as public. \n\nRelated to this is the question of storing a full-text archive copy of items. Pocket recently introduced this for all items for users with a Premium subscription at $5 per month. An alternative is Pinboard’s archiving service at $25 per year, which does the same thing, but obviously only on items sent to it by one of the routes outlined above. \n\nAgain, there’s not much in this one but **Instapaper** edges it for the presence of an automatic *and* a manual solution. \n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Instapaper** 4.5\n**Pocket** 2.5\n\nThat scoreline looks more one-sided than this feels to me. The things that bug me about Instapaper (the icon, the item list on iOS) really bug me and the things I like about Pocket (the iconography, the ties with Feedly) I really like. However, in a few key areas Instapaper has the upper hand: the web UI is flawless; the typography is stronger across all platforms. \n\nPerhaps the main barrier to me fully embracing *Instapaper* as my read-later client of choice, is the extent to which I get hung up on the ideal of the holistic setup. If I’m using Instapaper it feels wrong to me not to be using Digg Reader as my RSS client, and that’s not a step I’m prepared to take. Likewise, if I’m to continue using Feedly for RSS, it feels like I should be utilising the other service it is most closely tied: Pocket (particularly as I’m a heavy user of the third piece of that touted puzzle: Evernote). I may consider switching my RSS to something like Feedbin to alleviate this, or I could try and get past it and embrace the decision to use the best tool for each particular job, regardless of who owns them. \n",

Since launch it has been an incomparable piece of design in an increasingly crowded market. It did one thing, and from the hardware to the UI of the accompanying app, it did it superbly. When I was first considering getting a FuelBand 18 months ago I was persuaded as much by <a href=\"http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/nike-fuelband\">design blogs</a> as tech sites. The original FuelBand was a wonderful piece of minimal design, and last year’s release of the FuelBand SE made some meaningful changes to further perfect it.</p>\n<p>It’ll be a shame to see the FuelBand go away, but it’s not a shock. Even when I was looking for a way to track my activity, back in January 2013, the NikeTown employee talking me through my options said that the company’s push was towards the (free) app for iOS. It might seem counterintuitive that instead of trying to sell me a £120 piece of wristwear, Nike was pushing use of an app they don’t make money off. But the latter has two added values: first, there is no manufacturing cost; and second, the app encourages engagement with the NikeFuel community. At a basic level more user engagement means more opportunity to advertise to users, and it’s far easier for Nike to try and sell me some new shoes via the iOS app, than it is via a dot-matrix display on my wrist. The app is a cheaper, easier way to keep me engaged in the Nike ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake: even if FuelBands stopped rolling off the production line tomorrow, NikeFuel is here to stay. The company’s proprietary unit for measuring activity is baked into every tech venture they’ve launched in the last couple of years and has increasingly been the focus of a lot of their marketing. From software releases like <em><a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training\">Nike+ Kinect Training</a></em> for Xbox, and any one of the half-dozen Nike apps in the iTunes App Store (to track running, basketball, your training regimen…), to the recently revamped <a href=\"http://nikeplus.nike.com\">Nike+ website</a>, to the API made publicly available in January 2013, it’s clear that NikeFuel isn’t going anywhere.</p>\n<p>So why abandon the hardware effort? For the past couple of years the tech world has anticipated the advent of wearables as the next big market after smartphones and then tablets. For various reasons, however, the market for smartwatches will never be as lucrative as the one for portable, general-purpose computing, communication, and entertainment devices: the hardware will retail at a significantly lower price than tablets and phones, will likely require a smartphone to be present to make full use of their most interesting features, and will appeal in the first place to a smaller segment of the population than carries a phone. <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/think_wearables_are_the_next_tech_boom_think_again/\">The predicted $30 billion market for wearables by 2018</a> is dwarfed even by current iPhone &amp; iPad sales alone. There’s no question that Nike will want a front-and-centre presence when wearable tech becomes mainstream, but being one device among many competing for the consumer pound is likely not an exciting prospect for a company which now has a few years’ experience of the overhead cost of producing these devices.</p>\n<p>Recently I started to wonder whether it wouldn’t make sense for Nike+ to be baked into whatever device Apple ends up releasing. It would benefit Apple enormously not to have to build their own movement tracking suite, and it would be a win for Nike to be on the wrist of everyone who buys Apple’s product. This relationship goes back quite some way: the 5th gen iPod nano, released in 2009, had a non-deletable Nike+ app built right in - a trend that has continued to the current generations of the device, and spread also to the iPod Touch and the aforementioned clutch of apps in the App Store. When the iPhone 5S was revealed, with the M7 motion co-processor dedicated solely to motion-tracking, it was the Nike+ Move app - launched alongside the device - that first took advantage of the new technology. Furthermore Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has been a member of the Nike Board of Directors since 2005 and is in an excellent position to know which way the wind is shifting with respect to the wearables ecosystem. He’s also been <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1672688/apple-s-tim-cook-on-why-the-nike-fuelband-works-and-google-glass-doesn-t\">a vocal proponent</a> of the FuelBand’s value, and with that in mind, though this may be the end of the FuelBand as a standalone device, I fully expect that Apple’s eventual smartwatch will incorporate a large part of what Nike have built (software &amp; community) at system level.</p>\n",

The app is a cheaper, easier way to keep me engaged in the Nike ecosystem. \n\nMake no mistake: even if FuelBands stopped rolling off the production line tomorrow, NikeFuel is here to stay. The company’s proprietary unit for measuring activity is baked into every tech venture they’ve launched in the last couple of years and has increasingly been the focus of a lot of their marketing. From software releases like *[Nike+ Kinect Training](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training)* for Xbox, and any one of the half-dozen Nike apps in the iTunes App Store (to track running, basketball, your training regimen…), to the recently revamped [Nike+ website](http://nikeplus.nike.com), to the API made publicly available in January 2013, it’s clear that NikeFuel isn’t going anywhere. \n\nSo why abandon the hardware effort? For the past couple of years the tech world has anticipated the advent of wearables as the next big market after smartphones and then tablets. For various reasons, however, the market for smartwatches will never be as lucrative as the one for portable, general-purpose computing, communication, and entertainment devices: the hardware will retail at a significantly lower price than tablets and phones, will likely require a smartphone to be present to make full use of their most interesting features, and will appeal in the first place to a smaller segment of the population than carries a phone. [The predicted $30 billion market for wearables by 2018](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/think_wearables_are_the_next_tech_boom_think_again/) is dwarfed even by current iPhone & iPad sales alone. There’s no question that Nike will want a front-and-centre presence when wearable tech becomes mainstream, but being one device among many competing for the consumer pound is likely not an exciting prospect for a company which now has a few years’ experience of the overhead cost of producing these devices. \n\nRecently I started to wonder whether it wouldn’t make sense for Nike+ to be baked into whatever device Apple ends up releasing. It would benefit Apple enormously not to have to build their own movement tracking suite, and it would be a win for Nike to be on the wrist of everyone who buys Apple’s product. This relationship goes back quite some way: the 5th gen iPod nano, released in 2009, had a non-deletable Nike+ app built right in - a trend that has continued to the current generations of the device, and spread also to the iPod Touch and the aforementioned clutch of apps in the App Store. When the iPhone 5S was revealed, with the M7 motion co-processor dedicated solely to motion-tracking, it was the Nike+ Move app - launched alongside the device - that first took advantage of the new technology. Furthermore Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has been a member of the Nike Board of Directors since 2005 and is in an excellent position to know which way the wind is shifting with respect to the wearables ecosystem. He’s also been [a vocal proponent](https://www.fastcompany.com/1672688/apple-s-tim-cook-on-why-the-nike-fuelband-works-and-google-glass-doesn-t) of the FuelBand’s value, and with that in mind, though this may be the end of the FuelBand as a standalone device, I fully expect that Apple’s eventual smartwatch will incorporate a large part of what Nike have built (software & community) at system level. \n",

				"title": "Punchdrunk — The Drowned Man (2013)",
				"content_html": "<p>In a disused former Royal Mail sorting office next to Paddington Station something strange and wonderful is happening. The shell of the building has been resurrected, and exists now (at least temporarily) in a patchwork of guises: a 1960s Los Angeles film studio; a stretch of woodland populated with caravans; the setting of a desert funeral, its unmoving attendees stuffed with straw. These environs, meticulously realised and possessed of the unsettling ability to shift one-into-another, are the set of <a href=\"http://www.punchdrunk.com\">Punchdrunk</a>’s <em>The Drowned Man</em>, an epic work of promenade theatre employing a cast of 32 to tell numerous intertwining stories over three head-spinning hours.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZKNNMombV8\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>I’ve never experienced anything quite like <em>The Drowned Man</em>. During my time wandering inside it a number of other works of art in various media came to mind: David Lynch is an obvious touchstone (perhaps particularly 2006’s <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>) for the tonal sense of magic hour dread; there is something akin to the feeling of being lost in the collapsing text of Danielewski’s byzantine novel <em>House of Leaves</em> (2000); some video games have begun to stretch into this off-kilter experiential realm, such as <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> (both 2013). Ultimately, however, this intricately constructed piece of immersive performance art is powerful in ways that those other media cannot approximate.</p>\n<p>The strength of theatre is the fact of it being live, happening before you within parameters of time and space which it creates for itself. Punchdrunk’s reputation is for refiguring those parameters so as to include the audience as a vital axis of the story’s telling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Punchdrunk is about empowering the audience. The more curious they are, the more they are rewarded.</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/punchdrunk-to-stage-major-production-in-london-this-summer\">Felix Barrett</a> (Artistic Director, Punchdrunk)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Upon arrival at a performance of <em>The Drowned Man</em> visitors are instructed to be silent for the duration of the show, and are issued with a mask. It does not take long for these simple things to radically alter one’s experience. To have become one of hundreds wearing an identical white visage, and to be tasked with nothing more than moving silently, is equal parts liberating and unsettling. This is the skewed starting point from which your journey branches - and no two will be alike.</p>\n<p>The experience of voyeurism is a powerfully odd thing. You might find yourself one of a handful of white masks in a hotel room, watching someone do their make-up. You may be alone in the diner, reading the menu or the pin-board full of notes by the telephone whilst the waitress polishes glasses, seemingly oblivious to your presence. It doesn’t take long to get used to being a ghost.</p>\n<p>One of the more Lynchian moments I witnessed was a dancer auditioning on a checkerboard stage. To her mind her audience is one seated individual who sits in a leather chair sipping from a tumbler. In fact, however, she is surrounded by more than a hundred of us, white masks lined up in silence and stillness not just in front of the stage but to the side, and even from the back.</p>\n<p>During my visit I was witness to a few of these set pieces. As you wander the labyrinthine sets you often catch sight of an unmasked face, or hear a voice around some corner and know that you have stumbled across some unfolding moment - a piece of the larger story. Many audience members tend to latch on to a character and follow them from scene to scene, perhaps switching to another character if the fancy takes them, all the the while shining a little more light on the arcs of these presented lives. Some of my favourite moments came in the wake of those scenes, after the audience had moved on - lingering in the empty section of set and examine its contents: read handwritten notes from one character to another, look through the press clippings a starlet has chosen to deface, peruse a collection of props neatly arranged and labelled in glass cabinets. Even wandering in this relatively aimless manner I came across a line dance, a drowning, an overdose… and many more. One of the few things I knew of the show before attending was to be wary of its scale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember there is always one more floor than you think there is. I thought it was quite an experience, and one with moments of real jaw-dropping wonder.</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/jul/19/punchrunk-hype-drowned-man-lyn-gardner\">Lyn Gardner</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a visitor you are quickly relieved of the idea that you will be able to take in all that <em>The Drowned Man</em> has to offer. I seemed to spend the first 45 minutes on a single floor, and even then without venturing into some of its corners. A cinema, a drug store, a bar, hotel rooms…. The moment of arriving to another floor and setting foot on sand for the first time was a small revelation to me: there were worlds contained here, and without intention or comprehension I had penetrated some barrier. It felt like this from one level to the next: from the soaring tress of the wood-chip floored forest to the depths of the basement with its heavy doors that close with an unsettling finality, leaving you in tiny rooms of authentic dankness, lone props on pedestals your only company.</p>\n<p>By virtue of its sheer size there are corners of these worlds that feel untouched - places you find yourself in alone. I had this experience in a room behind a curtain where a reel-to-reel tape intoned the voice of studio director Leland Stanford giving directions for what turned out to be a scene I would witness play out later on. Or at least, I believe it was later. The flow of time inside the world of the work seems disrupted. There are two stories playing out (at least, not to mention the innumerable, equally fascinating attendant narratives with which they touch), and your experience of them is dictated by your choice of how to move about the world Punchdrunk has created. “Tonight your bearing shapes your fate” as Stanford informs / warns you as you enter. You catch moments, run into characters, hear things in the distance wreathed in all of that fog, and you’re able to put some of it together. But what happened to whom and when, and why… these questions will likely remain unanswered when you emerge blinking into the London streets a few hours later feeling changed.</p>\n<p>Whilst it wears film as a badge of influence, the piece takes joy in the freedom of eschewing that medium’s conventions of sequential narrative structure.

The closest experience perhaps is to be found in the realm of video games, where narrative can move at the player’s pace and exploratory freedom is accepted as the determining factor of the world-building enterprise.

I could hardly see anything and resorted to waiting in a hallway to see how the crowd would disperse.

Taking The Seamstress’s hand I was led to a dressing room, the door to which she quickly locked behind us. Once we were alone she spoke to me, instructing me to sit, then to come closer, and then telling me that she was going to get me ready for my “next big scene”. She performed another simple action that again had the effect of changing my whole experience: she removed my mask and set it aside as she began to tell me what was needed - “a little to the eyes, something to the lips”. She took up a pinch of some substance from the make-up tray and began to rub it into my lips, all the time telling me that I reminded her of someone: of “the first painted queen”.

				"content_text": "In a disused former Royal Mail sorting office next to Paddington Station something strange and wonderful is happening. The shell of the building has been resurrected, and exists now (at least temporarily) in a patchwork of guises: a 1960s Los Angeles film studio; a stretch of woodland populated with caravans; the setting of a desert funeral, its unmoving attendees stuffed with straw. These environs, meticulously realised and possessed of the unsettling ability to shift one-into-another, are the set of [Punchdrunk](http://www.punchdrunk.com)’s *The Drowned Man*, an epic work of promenade theatre employing a cast of 32 to tell numerous intertwining stories over three head-spinning hours.  \n<br>\n{{< youtube DZKNNMombV8 >}}\n\nI’ve never experienced anything quite like *The Drowned Man*. During my time wandering inside it a number of other works of art in various media came to mind: David Lynch is an obvious touchstone (perhaps particularly 2006’s *INLAND EMPIRE*) for the tonal sense of magic hour dread; there is something akin to the feeling of being lost in the collapsing text of Danielewski’s byzantine novel *House of Leaves* (2000); some video games have begun to stretch into this off-kilter experiential realm, such as *Gone Home* and *Kentucky Route Zero* (both 2013). Ultimately, however, this intricately constructed piece of immersive performance art is powerful in ways that those other media cannot approximate. \n\nThe strength of theatre is the fact of it being live, happening before you within parameters of time and space which it creates for itself. Punchdrunk’s reputation is for refiguring those parameters so as to include the audience as a vital axis of the story’s telling. \n\n> Punchdrunk is about empowering the audience. The more curious they are, the more they are rewarded.\n>  \n> — [Felix Barrett](https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/punchdrunk-to-stage-major-production-in-london-this-summer) (Artistic Director, Punchdrunk)  \n  \n<br>\n{{< youtube 6ktpes0qMZ0 >}}\n\nUpon arrival at a performance of *The Drowned Man* visitors are instructed to be silent for the duration of the show, and are issued with a mask. It does not take long for these simple things to radically alter one’s experience. To have become one of hundreds wearing an identical white visage, and to be tasked with nothing more than moving silently, is equal parts liberating and unsettling. This is the skewed starting point from which your journey branches - and no two will be alike. \n\nThe experience of voyeurism is a powerfully odd thing. You might find yourself one of a handful of white masks in a hotel room, watching someone do their make-up. You may be alone in the diner, reading the menu or the pin-board full of notes by the telephone whilst the waitress polishes glasses, seemingly oblivious to your presence. It doesn’t take long to get used to being a ghost. \n\nOne of the more Lynchian moments I witnessed was a dancer auditioning on a checkerboard stage. To her mind her audience is one seated individual who sits in a leather chair sipping from a tumbler. In fact, however, she is surrounded by more than a hundred of us, white masks lined up in silence and stillness not just in front of the stage but to the side, and even from the back. \n\nDuring my visit I was witness to a few of these set pieces. As you wander the labyrinthine sets you often catch sight of an unmasked face, or hear a voice around some corner and know that you have stumbled across some unfolding moment - a piece of the larger story. Many audience members tend to latch on to a character and follow them from scene to scene, perhaps switching to another character if the fancy takes them, all the the while shining a little more light on the arcs of these presented lives. Some of my favourite moments came in the wake of those scenes, after the audience had moved on - lingering in the empty section of set and examine its contents: read handwritten notes from one character to another, look through the press clippings a starlet has chosen to deface, peruse a collection of props neatly arranged and labelled in glass cabinets. Even wandering in this relatively aimless manner I came across a line dance, a drowning, an overdose… and many more. One of the few things I knew of the show before attending was to be wary of its scale: \n\n> Remember there is always one more floor than you think there is. I thought it was quite an experience, and one with moments of real jaw-dropping wonder.\n>  \n> — [Lyn Gardner](http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/jul/19/punchrunk-hype-drowned-man-lyn-gardner)\n\nAs a visitor you are quickly relieved of the idea that you will be able to take in all that *The Drowned Man* has to offer. I seemed to spend the first 45 minutes on a single floor, and even then without venturing into some of its corners. A cinema, a drug store, a bar, hotel rooms…. The moment of arriving to another floor and setting foot on sand for the first time was a small revelation to me: there were worlds contained here, and without intention or comprehension I had penetrated some barrier. It felt like this from one level to the next: from the soaring tress of the wood-chip floored forest to the depths of the basement with its heavy doors that close with an unsettling finality, leaving you in tiny rooms of authentic dankness, lone props on pedestals your only company. \n\nBy virtue of its sheer size there are corners of these worlds that feel untouched - places you find yourself in alone. I had this experience in a room behind a curtain where a reel-to-reel tape intoned the voice of studio director Leland Stanford giving directions for what turned out to be a scene I would witness play out later on. Or at least, I believe it was later. The flow of time inside the world of the work seems disrupted. There are two stories playing out (at least, not to mention the innumerable, equally fascinating attendant narratives with which they touch), and your experience of them is dictated by your choice of how to move about the world Punchdrunk has created. “Tonight your bearing shapes your fate” as Stanford informs / warns you as you enter. You catch moments, run into characters, hear things in the distance wreathed in all of that fog, and you’re able to put some of it together. But what happened to whom and when, and why… these questions will likely remain unanswered when you emerge blinking into the London streets a few hours later feeling changed.\n\nWhilst it wears film as a badge of influence, the piece takes joy in the freedom of eschewing that medium’s conventions of sequential narrative structure. Even the most well-realised world of the novel cannot supply the sensory experience of wandering around unguided, immersed in a truly altered reality, at liberty to inspect any of its minutiae that you choose. The closest experience perhaps is to be found in the realm of video games, where narrative can move at the player’s pace and exploratory freedom is accepted as the determining factor of the world-building enterprise.

This came out all the way back in January and must be one of my most listened to albums of 2013, but the way these two constituent elements play around and interact with each other never got tired for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-surfer-blood--pythons\">18. Surfer Blood — <em>Pythons</em></h3>\n<p>Hark! Guitars! And what a joyful racket Surfer Blood make on their second LP. To my ear this recalls mid-90s Weezer crossed with just a touch of something from the millennial New York scene of The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs etc. There’s nothing surprising here if you listened to their first album (and EP) as many times as I did, but there is so much to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. A dozen three-minute pop gems that vary in emotional tonality around the same bases as all my favourite emo / bubblegum bands of the past (shout out to That Dog!). Surfer Blood’s secret weapon, it should be noted, is John Paul Pitts’s voice: unusually tuneful and rich, but also capable of a Frank Black-esque scream if required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-shigeto--no-better-time-than-now\">17. Shigeto — <em>No Better Time Than Now</em></h3>\n<p>I came to Shigeto via a project by photographer Tim Navis in which several artists across various disciplines (video, photography, music&hellip;) took a trip to and around Iceland capturing their thoughts and experiences. That was enough to put this guy on my radar, and when Ghostly International put out this album - an immaculate set of spacious and contemplative electronica with some jazz influences - in August I was all over it. It’s been spinning regularly ever since.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-jon-hopkins--immunity\">16. Jon Hopkins — <em>Immunity</em></h3>\n<p>A blend of dance and more avant-garde melodic composition, <em>Immunity</em> is a very difficult album to categorise. In places it’s quite trancy and heavy, and then it’ll break for a meditative interlude and allow piano notes to linger amid a weighted silence. After dozens of listens I can’t entirely work out how such dramatic shifts are made to feel like a whole piece, but this remains one of the albums I’d recommend if someone was looking for an instrumental record from 2013.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-local-natives--hummingbird\">15. Local Natives — <em>Hummingbird</em></h3>\n<p>To my mind the sound of Local Natives is centred on Taylor Rice’s vocals: there’s a quiet melancholy there that sets the pace, and then thoughtful, spacious composition, and not- too-warm production paint the rest of the picture. There are some wonderfully emotive moments such as the quietly heartbreaking refrain of “you gave, and gave, and gave, and gave” in ‘Colombia’ that really struck a true chord for me, and tracks like ‘Ceilings’ that felt like perfect walking around music in spring and then again in autumn. A new band to me, I’ll be keeping an eye out for what follows next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-queens-of-the-stone-age--like-clockwork\">14. Queens of the Stone Age — <em>&hellip;Like Clockwork</em></h3>\n<p>It was immediately apparent to me, only a couple of tracks into my first listen, that this was the QotSA album I’d been waiting for since 2002. I’m not sure how, but Homme et al have managed to recapture pretty near all the magic that seemed to have ebbed away over the last decade, and perhaps even more perplexingly, they make it sound effortless. At their best Queens combine a sense of genuine menace and darkness with an irresistibly catchy edge. Often that dichotomy is presented in an even split between guitars and the rhythm section respectively, with Homme’s incomparable vocals snaking their way somewhere through the middle ground. They don’t really put a foot wrong across these 10 tracks and it feels great to have them back at full strength.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-mikal-cronin--mcii\">13. Mikal Cronin — <em>MCII</em></h3>\n<p>I didn’t know Mikal Cronin at the start of the year and tuned into this album on the strength of a great review I happened across upon its release in May. Not wishing to be reductive but this record fit perfectly into the gap left by the absence of a Ben Kweller album this year. It is built of the same stuff (pop-rock roots, folk-leanings, garage rock with a seriously melodic underpinning) and executed with the same verve, energy, and colour. There’s nothing too complex here, Cronin wears his heart on his sleeve musically, and has made an album that you feel like you’re intimately familiar with by about the third listen through.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-paramore--paramore\">12. Paramore — <em>Paramore</em></h3>\n<p>It’s no surprise that I have a soft spot for Paramore - they’re hitting a lot of the emo buttons I have wired up from years of listening to Jimmy Eat World and Jenny Lewis, whilst at the same time crafting huge singalong pop-rock that the Biffy Clyro / Foo Fighters listening part of me is still in love with. At 17 tracks this album is perhaps a little overlong considering the breadth of what is on offer, but I’ve played it a lot and the majority of it is pretty great. ‘Still Into You’ is unashamedly on the shortlist for songs of the year because at heart I’m a 15 year old girl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-holden--the-inheritors\">11. Holden — <em>The Inheritors</em></h3>\n<p>This set of endlessly inventive electronica ranges from complex &amp; heavy rhythms to lighter and more playful fare that recalls chiptune artists like Disasterpeace. James Holden can get pretty far out there, and his use of glitch and dissonance on some tracks makes for an uneven, if consistently interesting, listening experience. Not everything here is easy to love, but I’ve found myself being drawn in more and more over repeated listens. Once I felt I could trust Holden to make smart choices in his composition I started to really get into a lot of what is on offer here. If you can give yourself over to it, it’s an enormously rewarding record.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-dawn-of-midi--dysnomia\">10. Dawn of Midi — <em>Dysnomia</em></h3>\n<p>I feel bad for Roly Porter down there in 20th, my reasoning having been that I hadn’t found the time to listen to his LP in its entirety on enough occasions. I found that time for <em>Dysnomia</em>, partly because I came to the record earlier in the year, but also because it absolutely floored me on first listen. I was introduced to this band and this album by an episode of the Radiolab podcast and the ideas clicked with me: musical improvisation as a competitive artform; Aphex Twin and trance as rhythmic progenitors; the incremental development of a new style that brings the cold precision of computer-generated electronica through the warming filter of human players and acoustic instruments. The closest touchstone in my listening experience is probably The Necks, but this album feels tighter and more sparse in a way I find completely captivating. Dawn of Midi do an awful lot with comparatively little here, and I just can’t get enough of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-atoms-for-peace--amok\">9. Atoms for Peace — <em>AMOK</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t need to waste words here explaining how central Thom Yorke has been to my musical life since the mid-90s. What does need to be said, for fear of it being taken for granted, is how ceaselessly inquisitive he is as a musician. This latest dispatch seems to be an offshoot of the <em>Eraser</em> / <em>King of Limbs</em> branch (no pun intended) but has more than enough to it to also feel new and vital. Nothing feels like a retread, perhaps because Yorke is smart enough to surround himself with world-class musicians and do exactly what they collectively intend without compromise. I do feel that it’s easy to accept brilliance as a given from Yorke, and that threatens to obscure the achievement - I’ve loved listening to this album all year and I remain super-excited to learn what comes next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-tegan--sara--heartthrob\">8. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Heartthrob</em></h3>\n<p>I was disappointed in this record at first. 2004’s <em>So Jealous</em> remains my favourite T&amp;S album, and it’s taken some effort of will to contend with the reality that with each subsequent release they’re moving in a different direction. <em>Sainthood</em> (2009) took me some time to adjust to, and the jump to <em>Heartthrob</em> (perhaps evidenced in the four-year wait) felt even greater to me. The Quins sound like almost entirely different musicians from three albums ago, and that’s something to celebrate and marvel at. It’s not quite a Madonna-style wholesale reinvention but something more organic, the thread of which can now be traced back through <em>Sainthood</em> and <em>The Con</em> (2007). Of course, until the next album <em>Heartthrob</em> feels like the destination rather than another point on a continuum, but through repeated listening I gradually fell for the evolution represented on this record. I can’t resist chanting along with ‘Shock to Your System’, and the opening couplets of ‘I Was a Fool’ are capable of bringing a tear to my eye.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-emptyset--recur\">7. Emptyset — <em>Recur</em></h3>\n<p>Not wishing to place too much importance on categories, electronic music of various stripes was huge for me in 2013, and <em>Recur</em> quickly materialised as the zenith of that when it was released in October. There’s a great balance on this album of slowly building - via loops, modular tones, white-noise patterns etc. - and surprising the listener with some new element. The titular recursion is both rhythmic and thematic, and provides the album’s spine. On to that are grafted some of the most sonically interesting and exciting pieces of techno / noise / sound collage I found this year. As I’ve begun to explore some of the topography of electronica it has, naturally, been a process of learning where my tastes lie. Of all the records from that world that I heard this year <em>Recur</em> cascaded more dopamine into my system than any other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-haim--days-are-gone\">6. HAIM — <em>Days Are Gone</em></h3>\n<p>The debut album from these three Californian sisters (+ non-sibling drummer) is ridiculously catchy and possessed of a self-assurance in exactly what it is, which makes it pretty much irresistible. Part Fleetwood Mac, part 80s pop, part neon-lit dance, and soulful at the same time there’s is a lot to love here - especially since the mix doesn’t feel forced and doesn’t take any effort to listen to or learn, hum or sing along to. Songs such as album highlight ‘If I Could Change Your Mind’, Springsteen-esque ‘Don’t Save Me’, and the title track reveal a mature sense for songwriting and an emotional range that marks HAIM out from many of the poppier records I heard this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-kanye-west--yeezus\">5. Kanye West — <em>Yeezus</em></h3>\n<p>It still bugs me that I didn’t pick up Kanye’s previous album (<em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> (2010)) in the year of release; it would easily have been up there on the list. I had liked but not loved the first couple of albums, and been left cold by 2008’s <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>, but when I finally got around to listening to <em>MBDTF</em> it felt like the fulfilment of a promise. There’s little dispute about the fact that West is at the height of his powers right now, and <em>Yeezus</em> is unequivocally the product of an artist feeling completely unrestrained to create. The production alone here is flat-out stunning from first to last, sounding like nothing else I’ve heard. There are missteps (I’m not convinced Nina Simone’s ‘Strange Fruit’ is properly repurposed on ‘Blood on the Leaves’), and the album sags a bit in the middle, but nothing hit harder in 2013 than the first four tracks of this record. In terms of personality Kanye is hard to like, and some of the content is unsavoury, but it’s impossible to deny the artistry on display.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-chvrches--the-bones-of-what-you-believe\">4. Chvrches — <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em></h3>\n<p>To my mind this record is the pinnacle of what pop music produced this year. It fills the same role for me as Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em> did in 2010 and Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> last year: a meticulously crafted, brightly coloured blast of exuberant synth and singalong choruses. It’s not quite as flawless as the latter of those, but it is nevertheless an outstanding 50 minutes of polished, indelible songs, pretty much all of which are guaranteed to stick firmly in my head for hours and hours after listening. Not life changing perhaps, but thoroughly life-affirming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-biffy-clyro--opposites\">3. Biffy Clyro — <em>Opposites</em></h3>\n<p>I was skeptical that Biffy Clyro would be able to follow 2007’s <em>Puzzle</em> with anything that hit me as hard, and somehow they bottled lightning and produced a genuinely incredible next step in <em>Only Revolutions</em> (2009). How do you follow those two? Apparently you make a record as big as both of them combined, reaching further in both directions - esoterica and radio anthem - than before, and leave pretty much everyone else looking like they’re not trying.</p>\n<p>It took a long time for me to digest <em>Opposites</em>. I was so excited to hear it that as soon as it was released I had it on repeat and found myself dismayed that I wasn&rsquo;t keying into many of the tracks. I find that most Biffy songs lure you in with a seeming familiarity (of structure, of chord progression, of percussion) but are just off-kilter enough to ask the listener to do some of the work and meet them part-way. Listening to the entire album in whole gulps wasn’t doing it, and I had to break it up into two pieces and almost treat it as two separate albums. Then the rewards started flowing thick and fast: one giant-sized, super-powered anthem after another made its home in my head.</p>\n<p>This album has been a near-constant presence throughout the year, and has survived since January to claim a place in the top 5 without any real doubt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-manic-street-preachers--rewind-the-film\">2. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Rewind the Film</em></h3>\n<p>This year I saw Soundgarden play Brixton Academy. The material from their early-to- mid-90s heyday sounded great and the newer stuff sounded like they still want to be that same band (and aren’t quite capable of it). Here, on the other hand, is the 11th studio album from a band that have been together for more than two decades, and it’s a record that feels entirely at home in its skin. This year’s Pearl Jam album displays a similar understanding of how the musicians and the band’s place within the musical landscape has evolved, but the returns are lesser. What the Manics have achieved with <em>Rewind the Film</em> is very impressive indeed: a thoughtful, mature album that foregrounds the intelligence that their music has always possessed and doesn’t balk from examining the deeply unsexy subjects of middle age, depression, and Conservative Britain. As a document of a band’s continued mastery of their form it’s exceptional.</p>\n<p>Some of that same confidence is also present in the decisions to stick almost entirely to acoustic instrumentation, and to let guest vocalists lead some of the album’s best songs. The interplay between Bradfield and Lucy Rose on opener ‘This Sullen Welsh Heart’ is inspired, and Richard Hawley’s performance on the title track is simply incredible.</p>\n<p>This album was conceived as the first half of a two-album set, alongside the forthcoming <em>Futurology</em> (described as the next step on the path of <em>The Holy Bible</em> (1994) and <em>Journal for Plague Lovers</em> (2009)). I couldn’t be more excited to find out what the other half of the Manics’ sound has evolved into.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-arcade-fire--reflektor\">1. Arcade Fire — <em>Reflektor</em></h3>\n<p>There are many elements to my relationship with this record that echo my comments on Biffy Clyro’s: a double album the arrival of which had me wondering how it could possibly follow what came before, it also initially proved too large for me to parse as a single artefact. As with <em>Opposites</em>, breaking it in two bore fruit and it didn’t take long for me to fall for each piece of music, one-by-one. The genuine revelation, however, came when I was then able to recombine the constituent pieces into a whole, and follow the album’s many threads as they appear, disappear, reappear, and reflect over songs that feel at once entirely at home in the Arcade Fire catalogue and yet in many respects very new.</p>\n<p>Each AF album feels so stylistically of-a-piece to me: <em>Funeral</em> is modest and even-tempered; <em>Neon Bible</em> showier and more sharply critical; <em>The Suburbs</em> a balanced maturation and expansion of <em>Funeral&rsquo;s</em> themes of home &amp; family etc. It seem to me that <em>Reflektor</em> is closer to <em>Neon Bible</em>: like that album it’s in some manner a conceptual statement, here repeatedly returning to the subject of modern relationships. The explorations it makes on its themes are nuanced, insightful, and never stray into heavy-handed cliché - there are few bands reporting the modern experience to us with this degree of authenticity and artistry. Arcade Fire are operating on a new level with <em>Reflektor</em>, and are quite possibly the only ones inhabiting it.</p>\n<p>This is Arcade Fire’s fourth appearance at the top of my yearly list, and it was earned on merit. Already my favourite contemporary musical artists, I remain awed by what they are capable of.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Roly Porter — *Life Cycle of a Massive Star* \n\nI listened to and loved a lot of electronic music this year, from danceable stuff like Gesaffelstein’s *Aleph* and Four Tet’s *Beautiful Rewind* down to more experimental work like this. Porter’s ~35 minute album is a musical exploration of how a celestial body forms, exists, and decays; it’s probably best considered a single piece of music and it’s for this reason that a pretty incredible album is so low on the list: I just haven’t managed to sit down and listen to it start-to-finish more than a couple of times. When I have though, particularly through good headphones, it’s stunning.\n \n###  19. Pantha du Prince & The Bell Laboratory — *Elements of Light* \n\nAnother relatively short electronic album with a physics-based title. *Elements of Light* is more easily digestible than Porter’s record, and is based around a fascinating interplay between minimal electronica and a whole suite of bells played by the Norwegian ensemble The Bell Laboratory.

Shigeto — *No Better Time Than Now* \n\nI came to Shigeto via a project by photographer Tim Navis in which several artists across various disciplines (video, photography, music...) took a trip to and around Iceland capturing their thoughts and experiences. That was enough to put this guy on my radar, and when Ghostly International put out this album - an immaculate set of spacious and contemplative electronica with some jazz influences - in August I was all over it. It’s been spinning regularly ever since.\n\n###  16. Jon Hopkins — *Immunity* \n\nA blend of dance and more avant-garde melodic composition, *Immunity* is a very difficult album to categorise.

Manic Street Preachers — *Rewind the Film* \n\nThis year I saw Soundgarden play Brixton Academy. The material from their early-to- mid-90s heyday sounded great and the newer stuff sounded like they still want to be that same band (and aren’t quite capable of it). Here, on the other hand, is the 11th studio album from a band that have been together for more than two decades, and it’s a record that feels entirely at home in its skin. This year’s Pearl Jam album displays a similar understanding of how the musicians and the band’s place within the musical landscape has evolved, but the returns are lesser. What the Manics have achieved with *Rewind the Film* is very impressive indeed: a thoughtful, mature album that foregrounds the intelligence that their music has always possessed and doesn’t balk from examining the deeply unsexy subjects of middle age, depression, and Conservative Britain. As a document of a band’s continued mastery of their form it’s exceptional.\n\nSome of that same confidence is also present in the decisions to stick almost entirely to acoustic instrumentation, and to let guest vocalists lead some of the album’s best songs. The interplay between Bradfield and Lucy Rose on opener ‘This Sullen Welsh Heart’ is inspired, and Richard Hawley’s performance on the title track is simply incredible.\n\nThis album was conceived as the first half of a two-album set, alongside the forthcoming *Futurology* (described as the next step on the path of *The Holy Bible* (1994) and *Journal for Plague Lovers* (2009)). I couldn’t be more excited to find out what the other half of the Manics’ sound has evolved into.\n \n###  1. Arcade Fire — *Reflektor* \n\nThere are many elements to my relationship with this record that echo my comments on Biffy Clyro’s: a double album the arrival of which had me wondering how it could possibly follow what came before, it also initially proved too large for me to parse as a single artefact. As with *Opposites*, breaking it in two bore fruit and it didn’t take long for me to fall for each piece of music, one-by-one. The genuine revelation, however, came when I was then able to recombine the constituent pieces into a whole, and follow the album’s many threads as they appear, disappear, reappear, and reflect over songs that feel at once entirely at home in the Arcade Fire catalogue and yet in many respects very new.\n\nEach AF album feels so stylistically of-a-piece to me: *Funeral* is modest and even-tempered; *Neon Bible* showier and more sharply critical; *The Suburbs* a balanced maturation and expansion of *Funeral's* themes of home & family etc. It seem to me that *Reflektor* is closer to *Neon Bible*: like that album it’s in some manner a conceptual statement, here repeatedly returning to the subject of modern relationships. The explorations it makes on its themes are nuanced, insightful, and never stray into heavy-handed cliché - there are few bands reporting the modern experience to us with this degree of authenticity and artistry. Arcade Fire are operating on a new level with *Reflektor*, and are quite possibly the only ones inhabiting it.\n\nThis is Arcade Fire’s fourth appearance at the top of my yearly list, and it was earned on merit. Already my favourite contemporary musical artists, I remain awed by what they are capable of.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This year&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en movie of choice was <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> (2012), the story of a British sound engineer working on an Italian horror movie, which had been on my radar as one of the first films to receive a glowing review from <a href=\"http://thedissolve.com/reviews/25-berberian-sound-studio/\">The Dissolve</a>.</p>\n<p>The film, a British production from director Peter Strickland, is an oddly tense mood piece centred around a brilliantly restrained performance by career character actor Toby Jones. Over the years Jones has had a couple of prominent roles - most notably perhaps as the lead in 2006&rsquo;s <em>other</em> Truman Capote biopic - and recently he appeared as a fantastically loathsome Percy Alleline in Tomas Alfredson&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>. He was amongst a pretty stellar cast there, but here he&rsquo;s likely to be the most recognisable face.

It would have been very easy to allow the elements of this film to creep into pastiche, but Strickland has found a balance reminiscent of David Lynch in which the material is self-aware but still retains an unsettling aspect. As the various story threads progress the plot begins to blur some of the lines between what Gilderoy is working on and what he&rsquo;s living through. This bleeding of realities is mirrored in the construction of the film itself. Visual elements are often quickly intercut or presented as layered onscreen: characters seen behind glass which also reflects something else; light leaks encroaching onto the faces of (mock-)terrified voice actors.</p>\n<p>In one particularly memorable moment the very fabric of the film seems to corrupt, celluloid skipping off the reel and melting. Strickland uses a lot of these tricks to speak to Gilderoy&rsquo;s deteriorating state, and one of the film&rsquo;s great charms is that so little of the turmoil actually plays out in Gilderoy himself. Jones&rsquo;s portrayal is too thoroughly British to resort to overt displays of emotion: he&rsquo;s the anti-Jack Torrance, battling homesickness by listening to recordings of a mantlepiece clock and quietly reading (increasingly disturbing) letters from his mother. The one occasion on which he does try to channel the passionate Italian way of doing things is presented as a laughable failure. The dichotomy of a staid central performance amid increasing visual and narrative discord is tremendously effective.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly for a film set predominantly in a sound studio however, the greatest achievement here is in sound design. More so than any film I can think of <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> intends the audience to be aware of its auditory elements as vital components in storytelling. Early on we are introduced to the concepts of overdubbing and foley, and presented with a character in Gilderoy whose reputation is as a master of sound mixing. The film&rsquo;s genius is in the fact that no matter how frequently it draws attention to soundtrack as an artificial construction of filmmaking you never stop falling for the trick. Strickland employs many techniques to foreground the production of film audio: frequent close-ups on dials, sliders, and tape machines; full-screen shots of oscilloscopes; characters surrounded by magnetic tape that moves and shimmers as it records. And yet, as soon as the film provides you with something else to concentrate on you cease to consider the effects of the soundtrack on your viewing experience.

				"content_html": "<p>My memory of Tate Modern&rsquo;s Rothko exhibition in 2011 is of sitting, stunned, in front of these huge, imposing canvases that to me up until that point had only been images in books or on screens. It was the kind of visceral encounter with visual art that happens all too rarely - a qualitatively different experience to the usual ocular / intellectual engagement that comes from wandering a gallery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/10df999bce.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/3810bb4821.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/045ad7381e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Something similar happened when I recently paid my first visit to <a href=\"https://www.whitecube.com\">White Cube</a>, a gallery on Bermondsey Street in South East London. I had read about an exhibition, titled <em>Liminal Squared</em>, by Ethiopia-born artist Julie Mehretu that represented her reaction to the recent &amp; ongoing protests, demonstrations, and revolutions throughout north Africa and western Asia.</p>\n<p>Totalling twelve pieces over three separate galleries I was repeatedly surprised by the scale Mehretu worked in. The first piece you encounter as you enter South Gallery I is <em>Kabul</em> (2013). It&rsquo;s a large room, featureless as the venue&rsquo;s name suggests, and the 243.8 x 365.8 cm canvas, along with the even larger <em>Invisible Sun (algorithm 2)</em> (2013) on the adjoining wall dominate the white surfaces. I sat on the gallery floor to read the artist&rsquo;s bio, and looking up at these pieces made them feel all the more imposing. The longer you look at them new elements surface: exacting, digitally-drawn, blueprint-style lines; pencil elements drawn with a ruler (less exacting but still so); smudges of carbon or paint; bold lines of acrylic colour; loops &amp; strikes of black in varying degrees of boldness.

				"content_text": "My memory of Tate Modern's Rothko exhibition in 2011 is of sitting, stunned, in front of these huge, imposing canvases that to me up until that point had only been images in books or on screens. It was the kind of visceral encounter with visual art that happens all too rarely - a qualitatively different experience to the usual ocular / intellectual engagement that comes from wandering a gallery. \n\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/10df999bce.jpg)\n  \n![](/uploads/2023/3810bb4821.png)\n  \n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/045ad7381e.jpg)\n\nSomething similar happened when I recently paid my first visit to [White Cube](https://www.whitecube.com), a gallery on Bermondsey Street in South East London. I had read about an exhibition, titled *Liminal Squared*, by Ethiopia-born artist Julie Mehretu that represented her reaction to the recent & ongoing protests, demonstrations, and revolutions throughout north Africa and western Asia. \n\nTotalling twelve pieces over three separate galleries I was repeatedly surprised by the scale Mehretu worked in. The first piece you encounter as you enter South Gallery I is *Kabul* (2013). It's a large room, featureless as the venue's name suggests, and the 243.8 x 365.8 cm canvas, along with the even larger *Invisible Sun (algorithm 2)* (2013) on the adjoining wall dominate the white surfaces. I sat on the gallery floor to read the artist's bio, and looking up at these pieces made them feel all the more imposing. The longer you look at them new elements surface: exacting, digitally-drawn, blueprint-style lines; pencil elements drawn with a ruler (less exacting but still so); smudges of carbon or paint; bold lines of acrylic colour; loops & strikes of black in varying degrees of boldness. Up close elements appear layered, some visible as though seen through tracing paper. \n\nOn the train that morning I had started reading Adam Thirlwell's novella *Kapow!* (2012), which is also a kind of response to the same geo-political events. Mehretu's work brought to mind a passage in which the narrator begins to think about complexity & connectedness:\n\n> 'in my suspended state I was developing a theory that the important thing was to make connections between as many disparate objects as possible, like Godard saying somewhere that an image shouldn't be a comparison so much as a meeting of two more or less separated realities. The more the relations between the two realities are distant and just, said JLG, the more the image will be a strong one.'\n>   \n> — Thirlwell, Adam. *Kapow!*. London: Visual Editions, 2012. 10-11\n\nThe second gallery - 9x9x9 - has a set of five smaller etchings and another huge piece: *Aether (Venice)* (2011) (456.5 x 345.5 cm). \n\n![](/uploads/2023/c7ce71c7b3.png)\n\nPre-dating *Kabul* by two years *Aether (Venice)* shares much of its techniques as well as its scale.

Similarly, the works collected in the third and final space - South Gallery II - belong together as they comprise a series: *Mogamma: A Painting in Four Parts* (2013).

				"content_html": "<p>Whilst wandering around the internet recently, I came across this comic by <a href=\"http://www.incidentalcomics.com/\">Grant Snider</a>. I liked it instantly, clipped it, and then found myself going back to it frequently enough that it became obvious I had to write something about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/4781f02f60.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in minimalism, in its various forms, for quite a while: I find my interests leaning that way when it comes to design and architectural aesthetics; I wrote <a href=\"/uploads/2023/bf9357dbc8.pdf\">my Masters thesis</a> on the history of literary minimalism. Personally — and this was something that Snider&rsquo;s comic really brought home — my interest in minimalism is caught up with my interest in Buddhism. As I found myself thinking about the elements Snider had set out, I kept seeing parallels with Buddhist thought, and with my own practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-rid-of-the-unnecessary\">Get Rid of the Unnecessary</h2>\n<p>This is the core of it really, and it can be as prosaic or as profound as you like. Realising the difference between what is necessary and what is unnecessary is surpassingly difficult, and can easily equate to a lifetime&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s fascinating, as you get older, to discover how your attitudes to different elements of your life change — how things that once seemed so vital lose their pull, and that which you once wouldn&rsquo;t have given a second thought, takes on new importance. What is &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; is a shifting thing, and it <em>should be</em>. The valuable skill is tuning into what you honestly find to be important in the moment, and understanding your reasons. In that respect, minimalism emphasises focus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-structure\">Create Structure</h2>\n<p>Minimalism is also concerned with balance. As well as removing the extraneous, it&rsquo;s important to be mindful of how that which remains is arranged. Understanding the relationships between a structure&rsquo;s components is a central ideal of minimalism, whether it&rsquo;s the clean through-line of a short story, or the thoughtful arrangement of a room&rsquo;s furniture.</p>\n<p>Structure can also be constraining if employed too heavy-handedly, and I think there&rsquo;s a real difference between being aware of structure, and trying to impose it too strictly; if an <em>organic</em> structure works best, there&rsquo;s room for that too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stop-searching-for-hidden-meaning\">Stop Searching for Hidden Meaning</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to misread this one as a call for the acceptance of surfaces, and the surrender of one&rsquo;s exploratory impulse. I prefer to think of it in terms of spending less energy wondering about — or worrying about — the invisible, the possible, the elusive. For me it goes hand-in-hand with the next point…</p>\n<h2 id=\"embrace-what-is-solid\">Embrace What is Solid</h2>\n<p>Which is to say: be mindful of the present moment. One of the Buddhist principles I find most helpful, and yet most difficult to practice in daily life, is exactly this engagement with the moment itself. We&rsquo;re so used to looking forward and backward, and to thinking of things (and ourselves) in terms of our history and future. The minimalist call to stop looking for hidden meaning, and to embrace what&rsquo;s solid, is very similar to the Buddhist ideal of expending less energy on magical thinking, and more on the only real thing there is: the present moment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lose-yourself-in-patterns\">Lose Yourself in Patterns</h2>\n<p>There is a reason my first blog (more or less a decade ago!) was titled andthenpatterns. Yes, most directly it was named after the Four Tet track, but it&rsquo;s also down to how compelling I&rsquo;ve always found even the idea of patterns. Pretty much the only thing I took away from AS-Level maths was a glimpse at how numbers could produce some beautiful things. The application of that discipline was beyond me, but I took on a love of geometry that stays with me. This also speaks to the above points about structure and necessity; there can be nothing extraneous in a tessellation.</p>\n<p>Patterns also cropped up when I studied psychology, in relation to models of human cognition and memory. I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the extent to which patterns over which we have no control, dictate our experiences. In that regard, I like even more the specific manner in which this point is phrased: &lsquo;lose <em>yourself</em> in patterns&rsquo;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-fear-empty-space\">Don&rsquo;t Fear Empty Space</h2>\n<p>In terms of minimalist aesthetics, this can be read as a reminder that absence can be active. Whether it&rsquo;s the architecture of a physical space, the design of a webpage or printed document, or the form of a statue, this is a reminder that space can be just as important as content. Minimalism pushes back against the impulses to complicate and to fill every gap. I read this in conjunction with the first item: remove what isn&rsquo;t needed, and make the space which is created an integral part of the whole.</p>\n<p>This point also brings us right back to Buddhism again, where the concept of emptiness is key. To the extent that Buddhist practice is goal-oriented (and that&rsquo;s a whole other can of worms), one of the things it is working towards is the realisation that everything is empty. That sounds super-depressing until you begin to realise its implications. In part, that begins with the above points about the relationship between the solid, the moment, and literally everything else. Buddhists are big on causality — or dependent origination if you want to be fancy, — and the endgame is the realisation that emptiness and continuum are inescapable truths, and solidity is an illusion. If you&rsquo;re thinking that conflicts with the invocation to &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo; that&rsquo;s probably smart; I think that&rsquo;s a facet of the problem that Buddhism is engaged with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stay-clean\">Stay Clean</h2>\n<p>This is just good advice in general, but in terms of minimalist aesthetics it is probably best thought of (as with the patterns and the empty space above) with respect to the arrangement of elements. Removing the unnecessary is dependant on an understanding of what <em>is</em> necessary, and part of that is understanding the elements' relationships, one to another. In the visual arts you often hear people say things about &lsquo;clean lines&rsquo;; what that has always boiled down to for me, is an artist with a clear idea of how their work functions. Clarity is perhaps, overall, a more useful concept than cleanliness, but minimalism&rsquo;s rejection of needless complexity often makes the two synonymous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-bold-and-colourful\">Be Bold and Colourful</h2>\n<p>I like this one because it speaks out against the misconception of minimalism as overly subtle or reductionist. That might be true in some cases, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s inherent to minimalism as a style or as a concept. There&rsquo;s nothing subtle about work like Kasimir Malevich&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://artsy.net/artwork/kasimir-malevich-black-cross\">&lsquo;Black Cross&rsquo;</a>, or Sol Lewitt&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-number-1093-bars-of-color\">Wall Drawings</a> — these are undiluted artistic statements. Minimalism, in all its forms, can be enormously impactful by virtue of having cut away complicating factors. A minimalist work isn&rsquo;t engaged in too-clever obfuscation; it&rsquo;s asking to be engaged with by someone who is willing to &lsquo;stop looking for hidden meaning&rsquo; and &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s something inspiring in that plainness, as there is in the level of conviction that minimalism requires: it&rsquo;s a form without room for equivocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-be-too-expressive\">Don&rsquo;t Be Too Expressive</h2>\n<p>This is something that comes up a lot in reference to literary minimalism: the accusation (and the manner in which it&rsquo;s raised is almost always accusatory) that the language employed by writers like Raymond Carver, Amy Hempel <em>et al</em> is flat, disengaged, and emotionally barren.</p>\n<p>What is it about minimalism that shies away from the direct conveyance of emotion? The mistake that is often made is to suggest that this property of minimalism is resultant of fear of emotionality. This line of thinking holds that minimalism is dehumanising, and that it rejects emotions as too messy and unpredictable. Such an argument, however, assumes the prominence of emotionality in every sphere of our lives, and proceeds under the understanding that this is an unassailable state of affairs. Isn&rsquo;t there something to be said then for the minimalist model&rsquo;s placing emotion aside? By removing the unnecessary and giving emptiness its due, minimalism often (though not always) seeks to give us some room, and one important aspect of this room is to encourage reflection. For example, examination of one&rsquo;s <em>response</em> to a work of art can be an important manner of engagement. Avoidance of emotionality can be a high barrier for entry when approaching minimalism in the visual arts — and it is certainly a criticism favoured by those who deride literary minimalism — but I think there is something to be said for art that doesn&rsquo;t prescribe an emotional reaction.</p>\n<p>At the same time, much as I love minimalism, it would be myopic to suggest that it is universally appropriate. Minimalist artworks can be beautiful and meaningful, but there are places they cannot go. Similarly, minimalist music can be intricate and mesmerising, but you can&rsquo;t listen to Philip Glass all the time — you also need The White Stripes and Miles Davis, because, as messy as they are, they do things minimalism isn&rsquo;t interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"less-is-more-but-less-is-more-difficult-than-it-looks\">Less is More… But Less is More Difficult than it Looks</h2>\n<p>Read: this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>. Second only to the idea that it is reductionist, the next most common misconception of minimalism is that it is easy. Going right back up to the top, minimalism requires an understanding of what is necessary and what is not. It also necessitates a true understanding of the remaining parts' interoperability. You can&rsquo;t fake that, and attempts to do so are easily found out. True minimalism in any form is a pretty rigorous discipline.</p>\n<p>And, returning to a theme that has run throughout here, Buddhist practice can be the same. As the proverb goes: if you think doing nothing is easy, try it some time. Seriously, silent meditation is a great leveller, simply because it presents you with nothing but space for reflection — learning just to sit with yourself can be a really tough challenge, but that&rsquo;s the space from which everything else proceeds. Kind of like De Niro in his prime, you just have to learn to do nothing <em>really</em> well.</p>\n",

The minimalist call to stop looking for hidden meaning, and to embrace what's solid, is very similar to the Buddhist ideal of expending less energy on magical thinking, and more on the only real thing there is: the present moment.  \n\n## Lose Yourself in Patterns\n\nThere is a reason my first blog (more or less a decade ago!) was titled andthenpatterns. Yes, most directly it was named after the Four Tet track, but it's also down to how compelling I've always found even the idea of patterns. Pretty much the only thing I took away from AS-Level maths was a glimpse at how numbers could produce some beautiful things. The application of that discipline was beyond me, but I took on a love of geometry that stays with me. This also speaks to the above points about structure and necessity; there can be nothing extraneous in a tessellation. \n\nPatterns also cropped up when I studied psychology, in relation to models of human cognition and memory. I've always been fascinated by the extent to which patterns over which we have no control, dictate our experiences. In that regard, I like even more the specific manner in which this point is phrased: 'lose *yourself* in patterns'.\n\n## Don't Fear Empty Space\n\nIn terms of minimalist aesthetics, this can be read as a reminder that absence can be active. Whether it's the architecture of a physical space, the design of a webpage or printed document, or the form of a statue, this is a reminder that space can be just as important as content. Minimalism pushes back against the impulses to complicate and to fill every gap. I read this in conjunction with the first item: remove what isn't needed, and make the space which is created an integral part of the whole.\n\nThis point also brings us right back to Buddhism again, where the concept of emptiness is key. To the extent that Buddhist practice is goal-oriented (and that's a whole other can of worms), one of the things it is working towards is the realisation that everything is empty. That sounds super-depressing until you begin to realise its implications. In part, that begins with the above points about the relationship between the solid, the moment, and literally everything else. Buddhists are big on causality — or dependent origination if you want to be fancy, — and the endgame is the realisation that emptiness and continuum are inescapable truths, and solidity is an illusion. If you're thinking that conflicts with the invocation to 'embrace the solid' that's probably smart; I think that's a facet of the problem that Buddhism is engaged with. \n\n## Stay Clean \n\nThis is just good advice in general, but in terms of minimalist aesthetics it is probably best thought of (as with the patterns and the empty space above) with respect to the arrangement of elements. Removing the unnecessary is dependant on an understanding of what *is* necessary, and part of that is understanding the elements' relationships, one to another. In the visual arts you often hear people say things about 'clean lines'; what that has always boiled down to for me, is an artist with a clear idea of how their work functions. Clarity is perhaps, overall, a more useful concept than cleanliness, but minimalism's rejection of needless complexity often makes the two synonymous. \n\n## Be Bold and Colourful \n\nI like this one because it speaks out against the misconception of minimalism as overly subtle or reductionist. That might be true in some cases, but I don't believe it's inherent to minimalism as a style or as a concept. There's nothing subtle about work like Kasimir Malevich's ['Black Cross'](https://artsy.net/artwork/kasimir-malevich-black-cross), or Sol Lewitt's [Wall Drawings](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-number-1093-bars-of-color) — these are undiluted artistic statements. Minimalism, in all its forms, can be enormously impactful by virtue of having cut away complicating factors. A minimalist work isn't engaged in too-clever obfuscation; it's asking to be engaged with by someone who is willing to 'stop looking for hidden meaning' and 'embrace the solid'. There's something inspiring in that plainness, as there is in the level of conviction that minimalism requires: it's a form without room for equivocation. \n\n## Don't Be Too Expressive\n\nThis is something that comes up a lot in reference to literary minimalism: the accusation (and the manner in which it's raised is almost always accusatory) that the language employed by writers like Raymond Carver, Amy Hempel *et al* is flat, disengaged, and emotionally barren. \n\nWhat is it about minimalism that shies away from the direct conveyance of emotion? The mistake that is often made is to suggest that this property of minimalism is resultant of fear of emotionality. This line of thinking holds that minimalism is dehumanising, and that it rejects emotions as too messy and unpredictable. Such an argument, however, assumes the prominence of emotionality in every sphere of our lives, and proceeds under the understanding that this is an unassailable state of affairs. Isn't there something to be said then for the minimalist model's placing emotion aside? By removing the unnecessary and giving emptiness its due, minimalism often (though not always) seeks to give us some room, and one important aspect of this room is to encourage reflection. For example, examination of one's *response* to a work of art can be an important manner of engagement. Avoidance of emotionality can be a high barrier for entry when approaching minimalism in the visual arts — and it is certainly a criticism favoured by those who deride literary minimalism — but I think there is something to be said for art that doesn't prescribe an emotional reaction.\n\nAt the same time, much as I love minimalism, it would be myopic to suggest that it is universally appropriate. Minimalist artworks can be beautiful and meaningful, but there are places they cannot go. Similarly, minimalist music can be intricate and mesmerising, but you can't listen to Philip Glass all the time — you also need The White Stripes and Miles Davis, because, as messy as they are, they do things minimalism isn't interested in. \n\n## Less is More… But Less is More Difficult than it Looks\n\nRead: this stuff is **hard**. Second only to the idea that it is reductionist, the next most common misconception of minimalism is that it is easy. Going right back up to the top, minimalism requires an understanding of what is necessary and what is not. It also necessitates a true understanding of the remaining parts' interoperability. You can't fake that, and attempts to do so are easily found out. True minimalism in any form is a pretty rigorous discipline. \n\nAnd, returning to a theme that has run throughout here, Buddhist practice can be the same. As the proverb goes: if you think doing nothing is easy, try it some time. Seriously, silent meditation is a great leveller, simply because it presents you with nothing but space for reflection — learning just to sit with yourself can be a really tough challenge, but that's the space from which everything else proceeds. Kind of like De Niro in his prime, you just have to learn to do nothing *really* well.\n",

The xx — <em>Coexist</em></h3>\n<p>Like a lot of people I discovered The xx in 2009 when it was already too late to\nnot be influenced in some respects by the hype surrounding their debut. In\nfollowing up the Mercury winning <em>xx</em> they have chosen to refine their sound\nrather than make any radical alterations to it, but the result is a more focussed\nalbum than their first. I feel about it similarly to how I feel about Portishead&rsquo;s\nfirst two albums: the second is a more complete and technically perfect\ndistillation of the band&rsquo;s sound, though (in both cases) I marginally prefer the\ndebut.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-the-mars-volta--noctourniquet\">19. The Mars Volta — <em>Noctourniquet</em></h3>\n<p>The Mars Volta have been with us for almost a decade now and I feel no closer to\nworking them out. As maddeningly obtuse as anything they&rsquo;ve ever put out,\n<em>Noctourniquet</em> continues in the vein of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Octahedron</em> but with added\ndark-synth elements that do something to compliment Cedric&rsquo;s vocals, which still\nwalk the line between seeming stream-of-consciousness &amp; tightly controlled.\nThis is an album full of wilful music that only just falls short of their peak to date,\nwhich remains <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em> (2008).</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-the-shins--port-of-morrow\">18. The Shins — <em>Port of Morrow</em></h3>\n<p>It was with no small amount of impatience that I waited five years for a follow-up\nto <em>Wincing the Night Away</em> - one of my favourite albums of 2007. If this new\neffort from James Mercer et al is lower down this list than expected it&rsquo;s\nperhaps owing to the fact that it takes so few risks. In projects like Broken Bells\nand the track on <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em>, Mercer has shown that he&rsquo;s willing and\nable to try different things, and yet <em>Port of Morrow</em> plays it so straight that it&rsquo;s\nhard not to feel just a touch cheated. The flip side of that coin is that what is here\nis quintessential Shins: &lsquo;Simple Song’ could be the band’s calling card. It&rsquo;s a\nrecord I enjoy a lot, but which found itself – fairly or not – dwarfed by five years of expectation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-fiona-apple--the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do\">17. Fiona Apple — <em>The Idler Wheel is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do</em></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s strange to think that Laura Marling&rsquo;s entire three-album career to date fits\ncomfortably within the gap between Fiona Apple records. Apple is in no rush,\nand the release of <em>Idler Wheel&hellip;</em> was rightly met with huge expectations. As it\nturns out it’s a complex beast of a record, ceaselessly expressive and\nimpassioned but, like its title, sometimes unwieldy and rarely neat. I don&rsquo;t say\nthat pejoratively, I feel like it’s a choice taken consciously in the putting together\nof the record, and one that often pays dividends. Apple&rsquo;s voice remains\nincredible, with some of the extents she pushes it to (on ‘Daredevil’ for example)\nbeing comparable to PJ Harvey&rsquo;s exploration of her limits on last year&rsquo;s <em>Let\nEngland Shake</em>. Far from easily digestible, and as such a hugely rewarding\nrecord. ‘Every Single Night’ remains the most stunning piece of music I heard all\nyear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-deadmau5---album-title-goes-here-\">16. Deadmau5 — <em>&gt; album title goes here &lt;</em></h3>\n<p>A late-in-the-year discovery for me prompted by looking into the track ‘Professional Griefers&rsquo; featuring Gerard Way on vocals. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here but I&rsquo;ve found this whole album to be a great late-night listen, full of glossy synth and colossal bass-driven rhythms. Way competes with Cypress Hill, and Imogen Heap (sadly not on the same track!) as MVP guest contributor, but just as many of the instrumental tracks are highlights. Perhaps not one I&rsquo;ll still be playing in five years’ time but I&rsquo;ve given it a fair few spins this winter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-liars--wixiw\">15. Liars — <em>WIXIW</em></h3>\n<p><em>WIXIW</em> is the latest despatch from Liars as they continue to occupy some kind of\nweird limbo where music is extrapolated from the more outré elements of\nRadiohead&rsquo;s <em>Amnesiac</em>. I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is I find so\nappealing about Liars, and yet, like the three albums that precede it (perhaps\n2007&rsquo;s self-titled release most of all) I find this stuff endlessly worthy of re-\nlistening, re-examining, further puzzling over. If anything there&rsquo;s a slight\ndetectable lightening of the musical palate here, on tracks like ‘No.1 Against the\nRush’, which helps distinguish this record from 2010&rsquo;s <em>Sisterworld</em> - you\ncouldn&rsquo;t call it a change of direction however, Liars’ direction remains resolutely\nundecided.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-blondes--blondes\">14. Blondes — <em>Blondes</em></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled to remember how I cam across this one; most likely it was added\nto the stack of new release playlists I tend to build up on a Monday and then not\nget around to listening to for months on end. Regardless, once I did get around to\ndelving into this dense thicket of electronic synth &amp; rhythms I found myself\nhooked. There&rsquo;s something appealing about this album&rsquo;s unknowability: its one-\nword song titles and stark typographic artwork. It&rsquo;s there in the music too: no\nquarter given, no concessions made - an album to take or leave on its merits.\nSomething about its swooping, echoing calls and 16bit-esque samples caught my\near.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-royal-headache--royal-headache\">13. Royal Headache — <em>Royal Headache</em></h3>\n<p>With an average song length somewhere south of two-and-a-half minutes this is\nthrillingly energetic, under-produced garage rock of the purest kind,\naccompanied by a flawless ear for infectious melodies &amp; hooks. There&rsquo;s also an\nunmistakable buoyancy to it, a non-ironic optimism that you can&rsquo;t help taking on\nas you listen. As such it&rsquo;s one of the most fun-loving and simply enjoyable albums\nof 2012.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-wallace-roney--home\">12. Wallace Roney — <em>Home</em></h3>\n<p>At the start of the year there were a couple of jazz records that I was looking\nforward to: Christian Scott&rsquo;s double-disk opus, and the new album from Robert\nGlasper. Roney wasn&rsquo;t on my radar at that time, but a couple of great reviews for\n<em>Home</em> got me interested, and the album quickly became a headphone favourite\nfor me. Roney&rsquo;s trumpet is superbly expressive: by turns manic and pacific, and\nthe overall spread of the album runs all over the tempo and emotional\nspectrums. ‘Evolution of the Blues’ is a stand out favourite, as it builds a theme\nover eight minutes whilst still allowing room for impressive trumpet and piano\nsolos. I had though, over the last couple of years, that piano-led jazz was my\nflavour of choice but Roney brought brass back in style for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-cloud-nothings--attack-on-memory\">11. Cloud Nothings — <em>Attack on Memory</em></h3>\n<p>This is a lean, wiry, noisy record from a band I had no familiarity with at the start\nof the year. It was Steve Albini&rsquo;s production that first keyed me into this album,\nand it remains an essential ingredient in what appeals to me about what is\nessentially a post-rock / grunge fusion sound. The space Albini gives the\nrecording, so that it sounds like it&rsquo;s unfolding live in some otherwise empty\nroom, is what makes these songs breathe - especially the album centrepiece:\n‘Wasted Days’. That track alone is a brave sonic experiment from a band whose\nback catalogue is decidedly poppier than <em>Attack on Memory</em> would lead you to\nbelieve. But this isn&rsquo;t just a nostalgia exercise for those of us who haven&rsquo;t heard\nanything that sounds like <em>In Utero</em> in a good long while. It&rsquo;s a smart set of dark\nrock songs that says everything it has to in 33 minutes and leaves you wanting to\nhit play again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-four-tet--pink\">10. Four Tet — <em>Pink</em></h3>\n<p><em>Pink</em> has taken Kieran Hebden quite some time to put together, and reads less\ncohesively than previous efforts <em>There is Love in You</em>, <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>\netc. but is no less impressive. Four Tet was one of the artists that opened the\ndoor for me to electronica ten or so years ago, and his prolific output is\nstill some of my favourite work in the (loose) genre. Hebden can do warm as well\nas anyone, whilst still feeling experimental and never stale: ‘Ocoras' is a prime\nexample. Album highlight for me though is the closer: ‘Pinnacles’, which had a 7&quot;\nrelease least year and has a play count somewhere in the high thirties last time I\nlooked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-regina-spektor--what-we-saw-from-the-cheap-seats\">9. Regina Spektor — <em>What We Saw from the Cheap Seats</em></h3>\n<p>The twin attractions of a Spektor record are her captivating, somersaulting voice,\nand her faultless sense of melodies that stick in your head despite being just the\nright degree of off-kilter. It took a while for me to get into this record, but once I\ndid (once those tunes worked their way in there) it was one that I returned to\njust to listen to a track or two with increasing frequency. Before I knew it most of\nthe album had worked its magic on me. I enjoyed 2009&rsquo;s <em>Far</em> but it fell short of\nthe album that brought her to my attention: <em>Begin to Hope</em> (2006). This one is\nright up there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-portico-quartet--portico-quartet\">8. Portico Quartet — <em>Portico Quartet</em></h3>\n<p>This is one of those tenacious ones: a January release that has stuck it out all year\nto claim a place in the top ten. In some ways a pretty unexpected sounding\nalbum, the instrumentation favours the electronic far more than on previous\nreleases, but its constantly impressive what four talented musicians can conjure\nfrom the less familiar. Tracks like &lsquo;Spinner&rsquo; still feel heavily jazz-influenced, but\nthey are counterbalanced by the more electronica-esque songs like ‘Rubidium’; it\nfeels like the album was sequenced with this balance in mind and it works\nsuperbly. I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll still be listening to this one for years, but I&rsquo;m also\nintrigued to know where Portico Quartet go next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-godspeed-you-black-emperor--allelujah-dont-bend-ascend\">7. Godspeed You! Black Emperor — <em>Allelujah! Don&rsquo;t Bend! Ascend!</em></h3>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t get into GY!BE until it was too late, and I would say it has been a long\nwait for new material only I didn&rsquo;t really consider it a possibility that there\nwould ever be any (see also My Bloody Valentine). The four tracks of\n<em>Allelujah!&hellip;</em> comprise one of the year&rsquo;s most perfectly coherent albums, to the\ndegree that it almost makes little sense to consider the tracks separately\nappreciable. Opener ‘Mladic’ is one of the finest pieces of music of 2012, but only\nbecause its glacial, intoxicating build over 20 minutes dissipates into the slow\ncrawl of &lsquo;Their Helicopters Sing’. This is music of considered construction and as\nsuch it seems a cheat to listen to anything less than the full 50+ minutes. That&rsquo;s\nsomething I&rsquo;ve only managed a handful of times this year but I&rsquo;ll be coming back\nagain - there&rsquo;s something special in here for sure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-ben-kweller--go-fly-a-kite\">6. Ben Kweller — <em>Go Fly a Kite</em></h3>\n<p>After reaching a high with his eponymous album in 2006, Kweller left me a little\ncold with 2009&rsquo;s <em>Changing Horses</em>. I applaud the effort at adding something to\nthe palate but I&rsquo;ve never been able to key into country music to any great extent\nand found the tweaks to Kweller&rsquo;s pop-rock sound a little off-putting. It&rsquo;s clear\nright out of the gate here that things are back on power-chord, bubblegum\ncourse and once it gets going <em>Go Fly a Kite</em> never really lets up. The jaunty\npiano sing-along of &lsquo;Gossip’ is vintage, and Kweller finds a new gear with ‘Justify\nMe’ that is thrilling to hear. Looking back over the five post-Radish solo albums\nit&rsquo;s very impressive how many great songs this guy has written.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-islands--a-sleep--a-forgetting\">5. Islands — <em>A Sleep &amp; A Forgetting</em></h3>\n<p>Islands’ previous album but one, <em>Arm&rsquo;s Way</em>, made an appearance on The List\nin 2008, and yet drawing comparisons between that record and this one seems of\nlittle value. (There is also the matter of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Vapours</em> which is a different\nanimal again.) Islands’ sole defining characteristic is Nick Thorburn - the series\nof line-up changes that has altered the face of the band over the last three albums\nis difficult to overstate.</p>\n<p>All of which is only important in as much as it informs the state of <em>A Sleep &amp; A\nForgetting</em>. A very personal record for Thorburn, written pretty much solo on\npiano and released on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, it is perhaps one of the finest modern\nexamples of that pop staple: the break-up album. In places melancholy, and in\nothers possessed of an infectious optimism, Thorburn is brilliantly adept at\ncapturing his mood in song, wrapping melodies perfectly to the feel of his odd,\nsometimes touching lyrics.</p>\n<p>At its core <em>AS&amp;AF</em> contains some of the year’s most memorable, whistleable,\nsing-along-able pop songs, the strength of which would be enough to find it a\nplace on this list. That it is this high up is owed to the emotional strength and\nvariety of the material. One of my most played albums this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bloc-party--four\">4. Bloc Party — <em>Four</em></h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago when it was announced that Bloc Party were going into\nhiatus it didn&rsquo;t feel like a permanent thing. As with the last decade of Silverchair&rsquo;s existence there was always that slight fear that they would drift apart and not find their way back to each other for an extended period, but four\nyears doesn&rsquo;t seem like an unreasonable length of time to wait, especially as it\nsaw the release of a very interesting solo album from Kele, which served as an\ninsight into the presence of different musical impulses within the band.\n<em>Four</em> doesn&rsquo;t feel like the product of a divided band at all. It&rsquo;s muscular and\nassured in every respect: a definitive statement. There is musical diversity here,\nfrom the tender ballad of &lsquo;Real Talk’ to ‘We Are Not Good People’ at the other end\nof the record&rsquo;s (and the band&rsquo;s) spectrum, but it comes across as cohesive and\nwell built. This is a set of musicians very familiar with each other&rsquo;s strengths and\nweaknesses and fully in command of what their band has been and can be.</p>\n<p>Repeated listens reveal a multitude of wonderful moments: the seductive bridge\nof &lsquo;3X3’, the none-more-angular guitar spine of ‘Octopus’, the Smashing-\nPumpkins-via-Weezer solo in &lsquo;Kettling&rsquo; - and it&rsquo;s out of these that the record as a\nwhole is built, moving from one to the next with a sure hand and without a\nmisstep.</p>\n<p>The only things to dislike about the record are its poorly conceived cover art and\nthe soon-irritating spoken interludes between numerous tracks. Luckily both of\nthese decisions are easily edited out via iTunes, leaving a pretty flawless 21st\ncentury pop-rock album.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-grimes--visions\">3. Grimes — <em>Visions</em></h3>\n<p>New discovery of the year goes to Grimes. I stumbled across the video for (album\nhighlight) ‘Oblivion’ on Pitchfork back in January and was instantly hooked. The\nalbum was one of the first I purchased this year, and between my iPod and the\nCD I burned for Elizabeth&rsquo;s car it must be one of my most listened to records of 2012. That I&rsquo;m nowhere near tired of it is a testament to the strength of the\nsongwriting. From the artwork to the videos and her on-stage abandon you\nmight not think that &lsquo;subtlety&rsquo; would be Grimes&rsquo;s strength but in large part it&rsquo;s\nthe ingredient that makes this album work. There&rsquo;s no overindulgence on this\nrecord, which moves sure-footedly around a dance/trance borderland knowing\nexactly when a dark bass grove or a distorted vocal is called for, but never\noverplaying these elements, content to let the kernel of the album&rsquo;s hypnotic\nrhythms do most of the talking.</p>\n<p>Also, she is <em>nearly</em> as entertaining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grimezsz\">on Twitter</a> as she is on record, so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-metric--synthetica\">2. Metric — <em>Synthetica</em></h3>\n<p>This is the kind of flawless start-to-finish pop record that only comes along very\nrarely. Somehow, over 11 tracks, Metric don&rsquo;t make a single misstep. It&rsquo;s been\none of those rare albums with which I&rsquo;m constantly undecided as to which is my\nfavourite track. The 40 minute run time fairly flies by in a whirl of soaring hooks,\nlap-drummable percussion, and singalong choruses, and I almost always want to\nhit play on this again.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing my favourite track is probably the perfect night-driving\nsoundtrack ‘Speed the Collapse’ or the year&rsquo;s best danceable anthem ‘Breathing Underwater’&hellip; or maybe twisted ballad &lsquo;Lost Kitten’. Stop asking me to choose!\nFor me this record harks back to Garbage at their mid-90s finest. That band&rsquo;s\nfirst two records were very important to me at the time, and still get the odd play\nnow, but <em>Synthetica</em> may well be better.</p>\n<p>..OK, my favourite is ‘Clone’. (Or maybe &lsquo;The Void&rsquo;.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-deftones--koi-no-yokan\">1. Deftones — <em>Koi No Yokan</em></h3>\n<p>Probably having read about it in the darkest corners of <em>Kerrang!</em> magazine, I\nstill remember putting down far too much money at my local Our Price to import a copy\nof 1995&rsquo;s <em>Adrenaline</em>. When it eventually turned up however, the wait and the\nmoney had proved to be well worth it. Unfairly tied to bands from the nu metal\nscene emerging at the same time, Deftones never really fit that mould: they were\ntoo melodic, too obtuse and, as the albums moved on, too romantic. <em>Around the\nFur</em> was nothing short of a new gospel to me when it arrived in 1997, and\n2000&rsquo;s <em>White Pony</em> is a religious text I still consult regularly today - without\nquestion one of my desert island discs and some days my favourite record of all\ntime.</p>\n<p>Solid and enjoyable as they most certainly are <em>Deftones</em> (2003), and <em>Saturday\nNight Wrist</em> (2006) failed to set my world alight as their three predecessors had\ndone. To listen back to those albums now (and they are still eminently listenable)\nsounds to me like a band treading water to some extent; re-working what they\ndid well with somewhat lesser returns.</p>\n<p>When Deftones shelved the almost complete <em>Eros</em> in 2009, following bassist\nChi Cheng&rsquo;s tragic accident (which leaves him in a coma to this day), it felt to me\nlike an admission that the band were struggling with their own identity. Particularly in the absence of a founding member it must have been incredibly\ndifficult to grasp what the band stood for anymore. However, with <em>Diamond\nEyes</em>, a soaring and heartfelt tribute to their friend, Deftones secured a place in\nmy top 10 for 2010. That record was proof that this was still a band capable of\ngreat things and <em>Koi No Yokan</em> is the fulfilment of that promise.\nIn many ways the culmination of all of Deftones’ strengths, this is a rock\nrecord full of tenderness and passion. As brutal as it is elegiac, and as romantic as\nit is bruising. No other band I know of under the sun can fuse these elements so\nflawlessly, and in <em>Koi No Yokan</em> Deftones have created something that can\nstand proudly shoulder to shoulder with their millennial masterpiece.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

The xx — *Coexist*\n\nLike a lot of people I discovered The xx in 2009 when it was already too late to\nnot be influenced in some respects by the hype surrounding their debut.

If this new\neffort from James Mercer et al is lower down this list than expected it's\nperhaps owing to the fact that it takes so few risks. In projects like Broken Bells\nand the track on *Dark Night of the Soul*, Mercer has shown that he's willing and\nable to try different things, and yet *Port of Morrow* plays it so straight that it's\nhard not to feel just a touch cheated. The flip side of that coin is that what is here\nis quintessential Shins: 'Simple Song’ could be the band’s calling card. It's a\nrecord I enjoy a lot, but which found itself – fairly or not – dwarfed by five years of expectation.\n\n###  17. Fiona Apple — *The Idler Wheel is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do*\n\nIt's strange to think that Laura Marling's entire three-album career to date fits\ncomfortably within the gap between Fiona Apple records. Apple is in no rush,\nand the release of *Idler Wheel...* was rightly met with huge expectations. As it\nturns out it’s a complex beast of a record, ceaselessly expressive and\nimpassioned but, like its title, sometimes unwieldy and rarely neat. I don't say\nthat pejoratively, I feel like it’s a choice taken consciously in the putting together\nof the record, and one that often pays dividends. Apple's voice remains\nincredible, with some of the extents she pushes it to (on ‘Daredevil’ for example)\nbeing comparable to PJ Harvey's exploration of her limits on last year's *Let\nEngland Shake*. Far from easily digestible, and as such a hugely rewarding\nrecord. ‘Every Single Night’ remains the most stunning piece of music I heard all\nyear.\n\n###  16. Deadmau5 — *> album title goes here <* \n\nA late-in-the-year discovery for me prompted by looking into the track ‘Professional Griefers' featuring Gerard Way on vocals. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here but I've found this whole album to be a great late-night listen, full of glossy synth and colossal bass-driven rhythms. Way competes with Cypress Hill, and Imogen Heap (sadly not on the same track!) as MVP guest contributor, but just as many of the instrumental tracks are highlights. Perhaps not one I'll still be playing in five years’ time but I've given it a fair few spins this winter.\n\n###  15. Liars — *WIXIW*\n\n*WIXIW* is the latest despatch from Liars as they continue to occupy some kind of\nweird limbo where music is extrapolated from the more outré elements of\nRadiohead's *Amnesiac*. I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is I find so\nappealing about Liars, and yet, like the three albums that precede it (perhaps\n2007's self-titled release most of all) I find this stuff endlessly worthy of re-\nlistening, re-examining, further puzzling over. If anything there's a slight\ndetectable lightening of the musical palate here, on tracks like ‘No.1 Against the\nRush’, which helps distinguish this record from 2010's *Sisterworld* - you\ncouldn't call it a change of direction however, Liars’ direction remains resolutely\nundecided.\n\n###  14. Blondes — *Blondes*\n\nI've struggled to remember how I cam across this one; most likely it was added\nto the stack of new release playlists I tend to build up on a Monday and then not\nget around to listening to for months on end. Regardless, once I did get around to\ndelving into this dense thicket of electronic synth & rhythms I found myself\nhooked. There's something appealing about this album's unknowability: its one-\nword song titles and stark typographic artwork. It's there in the music too: no\nquarter given, no concessions made - an album to take or leave on its merits.\nSomething about its swooping, echoing calls and 16bit-esque samples caught my\near.\n\n###  13. Royal Headache — *Royal Headache*\n\nWith an average song length somewhere south of two-and-a-half minutes this is\nthrillingly energetic, under-produced garage rock of the purest kind,\naccompanied by a flawless ear for infectious melodies & hooks. There's also an\nunmistakable buoyancy to it, a non-ironic optimism that you can't help taking on\nas you listen. As such it's one of the most fun-loving and simply enjoyable albums\nof 2012.\n\n###  12. Wallace Roney — *Home*\n\nAt the start of the year there were a couple of jazz records that I was looking\nforward to: Christian Scott's double-disk opus, and the new album from Robert\nGlasper. Roney wasn't on my radar at that time, but a couple of great reviews for\n*Home* got me interested, and the album quickly became a headphone favourite\nfor me. Roney's trumpet is superbly expressive: by turns manic and pacific, and\nthe overall spread of the album runs all over the tempo and emotional\nspectrums. ‘Evolution of the Blues’ is a stand out favourite, as it builds a theme\nover eight minutes whilst still allowing room for impressive trumpet and piano\nsolos. I had though, over the last couple of years, that piano-led jazz was my\nflavour of choice but Roney brought brass back in style for me.\n\n###  11. Cloud Nothings — *Attack on Memory*\n\nThis is a lean, wiry, noisy record from a band I had no familiarity with at the start\nof the year. It was Steve Albini's production that first keyed me into this album,\nand it remains an essential ingredient in what appeals to me about what is\nessentially a post-rock / grunge fusion sound. The space Albini gives the\nrecording, so that it sounds like it's unfolding live in some otherwise empty\nroom, is what makes these songs breathe - especially the album centrepiece:\n‘Wasted Days’. That track alone is a brave sonic experiment from a band whose\nback catalogue is decidedly poppier than *Attack on Memory* would lead you to\nbelieve. But this isn't just a nostalgia exercise for those of us who haven't heard\nanything that sounds like *In Utero* in a good long while. It's a smart set of dark\nrock songs that says everything it has to in 33 minutes and leaves you wanting to\nhit play again.\n\n###  10. Four Tet — *Pink*\n\n*Pink* has taken Kieran Hebden quite some time to put together, and reads less\ncohesively than previous efforts *There is Love in You*, *Everything Ecstatic*\netc. but is no less impressive. Four Tet was one of the artists that opened the\ndoor for me to electronica ten or so years ago, and his prolific output is\nstill some of my favourite work in the (loose) genre. Hebden can do warm as well\nas anyone, whilst still feeling experimental and never stale: ‘Ocoras' is a prime\nexample. Album highlight for me though is the closer: ‘Pinnacles’, which had a 7\"\nrelease least year and has a play count somewhere in the high thirties last time I\nlooked.\n\n###  9. Regina Spektor — *What We Saw from the Cheap Seats*\n\nThe twin attractions of a Spektor record are her captivating, somersaulting voice,\nand her faultless sense of melodies that stick in your head despite being just the\nright degree of off-kilter. It took a while for me to get into this record, but once I\ndid (once those tunes worked their way in there) it was one that I returned to\njust to listen to a track or two with increasing frequency. Before I knew it most of\nthe album had worked its magic on me. I enjoyed 2009's *Far* but it fell short of\nthe album that brought her to my attention: *Begin to Hope* (2006). This one is\nright up there.\n\n###  8. Portico Quartet — *Portico Quartet*\n\nThis is one of those tenacious ones: a January release that has stuck it out all year\nto claim a place in the top ten. In some ways a pretty unexpected sounding\nalbum, the instrumentation favours the electronic far more than on previous\nreleases, but its constantly impressive what four talented musicians can conjure\nfrom the less familiar. Tracks like 'Spinner' still feel heavily jazz-influenced, but\nthey are counterbalanced by the more electronica-esque songs like ‘Rubidium’; it\nfeels like the album was sequenced with this balance in mind and it works\nsuperbly. I have a feeling I'll still be listening to this one for years, but I'm also\nintrigued to know where Portico Quartet go next.\n\n###  7. Godspeed You! Black Emperor — *Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!*\n\nI didn't get into GY!BE until it was too late, and I would say it has been a long\nwait for new material only I didn't really consider it a possibility that there\nwould ever be any (see also My Bloody Valentine). The four tracks of\n*Allelujah!...* comprise one of the year's most perfectly coherent albums, to the\ndegree that it almost makes little sense to consider the tracks separately\nappreciable. Opener ‘Mladic’ is one of the finest pieces of music of 2012, but only\nbecause its glacial, intoxicating build over 20 minutes dissipates into the slow\ncrawl of 'Their Helicopters Sing’. This is music of considered construction and as\nsuch it seems a cheat to listen to anything less than the full 50+ minutes. That's\nsomething I've only managed a handful of times this year but I'll be coming back\nagain - there's something special in here for sure.\n\n###  6. Ben Kweller — *Go Fly a Kite*\n\nAfter reaching a high with his eponymous album in 2006, Kweller left me a little\ncold with 2009's *Changing Horses*. I applaud the effort at adding something to\nthe palate but I've never been able to key into country music to any great extent\nand found the tweaks to Kweller's pop-rock sound a little off-putting. It's clear\nright out of the gate here that things are back on power-chord, bubblegum\ncourse and once it gets going *Go Fly a Kite* never really lets up. The jaunty\npiano sing-along of 'Gossip’ is vintage, and Kweller finds a new gear with ‘Justify\nMe’ that is thrilling to hear. Looking back over the five post-Radish solo albums\nit's very impressive how many great songs this guy has written.\n\n###  5. Islands — *A Sleep & A Forgetting*\n\nIslands’ previous album but one, *Arm's Way*, made an appearance on The List\nin 2008, and yet drawing comparisons between that record and this one seems of\nlittle value. (There is also the matter of 2009's *Vapours* which is a different\nanimal again.) Islands’ sole defining characteristic is Nick Thorburn - the series\nof line-up changes that has altered the face of the band over the last three albums\nis difficult to overstate.\n\nAll of which is only important in as much as it informs the state of *A Sleep & A\nForgetting*. A very personal record for Thorburn, written pretty much solo on\npiano and released on Valentine's Day, it is perhaps one of the finest modern\nexamples of that pop staple: the break-up album. In places melancholy, and in\nothers possessed of an infectious optimism, Thorburn is brilliantly adept at\ncapturing his mood in song, wrapping melodies perfectly to the feel of his odd,\nsometimes touching lyrics.\n\nAt its core *AS&AF* contains some of the year’s most memorable, whistleable,\nsing-along-able pop songs, the strength of which would be enough to find it a\nplace on this list. That it is this high up is owed to the emotional strength and\nvariety of the material. One of my most played albums this year.\n\n###  4. Bloc Party — *Four*\n\nA couple of years ago when it was announced that Bloc Party were going into\nhiatus it didn't feel like a permanent thing. As with the last decade of Silverchair's existence there was always that slight fear that they would drift apart and not find their way back to each other for an extended period, but four\nyears doesn't seem like an unreasonable length of time to wait, especially as it\nsaw the release of a very interesting solo album from Kele, which served as an\ninsight into the presence of different musical impulses within the band.\n*Four* doesn't feel like the product of a divided band at all. It's muscular and\nassured in every respect: a definitive statement. There is musical diversity here,\nfrom the tender ballad of 'Real Talk’ to ‘We Are Not Good People’ at the other end\nof the record's (and the band's) spectrum, but it comes across as cohesive and\nwell built. This is a set of musicians very familiar with each other's strengths and\nweaknesses and fully in command of what their band has been and can be.\n\nRepeated listens reveal a multitude of wonderful moments: the seductive bridge\nof '3X3’, the none-more-angular guitar spine of ‘Octopus’, the Smashing-\nPumpkins-via-Weezer solo in 'Kettling' - and it's out of these that the record as a\nwhole is built, moving from one to the next with a sure hand and without a\nmisstep.\n\nThe only things to dislike about the record are its poorly conceived cover art and\nthe soon-irritating spoken interludes between numerous tracks. Luckily both of\nthese decisions are easily edited out via iTunes, leaving a pretty flawless 21st\ncentury pop-rock album.\n\n###  3. Grimes — *Visions*\n\nNew discovery of the year goes to Grimes. I stumbled across the video for (album\nhighlight) ‘Oblivion’ on Pitchfork back in January and was instantly hooked. The\nalbum was one of the first I purchased this year, and between my iPod and the\nCD I burned for Elizabeth's car it must be one of my most listened to records of 2012. That I'm nowhere near tired of it is a testament to the strength of the\nsongwriting. From the artwork to the videos and her on-stage abandon you\nmight not think that 'subtlety' would be Grimes's strength but in large part it's\nthe ingredient that makes this album work. There's no overindulgence on this\nrecord, which moves sure-footedly around a dance/trance borderland knowing\nexactly when a dark bass grove or a distorted vocal is called for, but never\noverplaying these elements, content to let the kernel of the album's hypnotic\nrhythms do most of the talking.\n\nAlso, she is *nearly* as entertaining [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz) as she is on record, so that's a plus.\n\n### 2. Metric — *Synthetica*\n\nThis is the kind of flawless start-to-finish pop record that only comes along very\nrarely. Somehow, over 11 tracks, Metric don't make a single misstep. It's been\none of those rare albums with which I'm constantly undecided as to which is my\nfavourite track. The 40 minute run time fairly flies by in a whirl of soaring hooks,\nlap-drummable percussion, and singalong choruses, and I almost always want to\nhit play on this again.\n\nAt the time of writing my favourite track is probably the perfect night-driving\nsoundtrack ‘Speed the Collapse’ or the year's best danceable anthem ‘Breathing Underwater’... or maybe twisted ballad 'Lost Kitten’. Stop asking me to choose!\nFor me this record harks back to Garbage at their mid-90s finest. That band's\nfirst two records were very important to me at the time, and still get the odd play\nnow, but *Synthetica* may well be better.\n\n..OK, my favourite is ‘Clone’. (Or maybe 'The Void'.)\n\n\n###  1. Deftones — *Koi No Yokan*\n\nProbably having read about it in the darkest corners of *Kerrang!* magazine, I\nstill remember putting down far too much money at my local Our Price to import a copy\nof 1995's *Adrenaline*. When it eventually turned up however, the wait and the\nmoney had proved to be well worth it. Unfairly tied to bands from the nu metal\nscene emerging at the same time, Deftones never really fit that mould: they were\ntoo melodic, too obtuse and, as the albums moved on, too romantic. *Around the\nFur* was nothing short of a new gospel to me when it arrived in 1997, and\n2000's *White Pony* is a religious text I still consult regularly today - without\nquestion one of my desert island discs and some days my favourite record of all\ntime.\n\nSolid and enjoyable as they most certainly are *Deftones* (2003), and *Saturday\nNight Wrist* (2006) failed to set my world alight as their three predecessors had\ndone. To listen back to those albums now (and they are still eminently listenable)\nsounds to me like a band treading water to some extent; re-working what they\ndid well with somewhat lesser returns.\n\nWhen Deftones shelved the almost complete *Eros* in 2009, following bassist\nChi Cheng's tragic accident (which leaves him in a coma to this day), it felt to me\nlike an admission that the band were struggling with their own identity. Particularly in the absence of a founding member it must have been incredibly\ndifficult to grasp what the band stood for anymore. However, with *Diamond\nEyes*, a soaring and heartfelt tribute to their friend, Deftones secured a place in\nmy top 10 for 2010. That record was proof that this was still a band capable of\ngreat things and *Koi No Yokan* is the fulfilment of that promise.\nIn many ways the culmination of all of Deftones’ strengths, this is a rock\nrecord full of tenderness and passion. As brutal as it is elegiac, and as romantic as\nit is bruising. No other band I know of under the sun can fuse these elements so\nflawlessly, and in *Koi No Yokan* Deftones have created something that can\nstand proudly shoulder to shoulder with their millennial masterpiece.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

In both cases I find the tools at users' disposal a little constraining: with the exception of an avatar and a header image there is no possibility of template personalisation (where would the adverts go!?), and the manner in which text, photos, video and everything else is displayed is dictated by the platform rather than the user.</p>\n<p>Tumblr represents a strange middle ground.

I may choose an iPhone and Gmail where you prefer your Windows Phone and Outlook, but neither choice makes any sense if we can't call or write to each other.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\n**More ideas on this topic:**\n\n• App.net Podcast [episode 4](http://blog.app.net/2012/12/14/app-net-podcast-episode-4/); [episode 5](http://blog.app.net/2012/12/20/app-net-podcast-episode-5/)  \n• David Karp [talk for Wired 2012](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/25/david-karp-tumblr)  \n• '[The Social Web: End of First Cycle](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=14546)' – Warren Ellis  \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Film is a manipulative art form. Much of its effectiveness is derived from its ability to make us <em>feel</em>. We are carried along with the sweep of a well-executed dolly shot, or tricked by a jump-cut; we are caught up by the story&rsquo;s pace as determined in the editing room; our emotional response is keyed to and prompted by the score. The rudiments of film construction are all centred upon affecting the audience. Though that may read like a cynical view of the medium, it is in fact to cinema&rsquo;s great credit that it has evolved such a <em>direct</em> connection to viewers.</p>\n<p>For me there are perhaps no films more manipulative than those in the James Bond franchise. Like many filmgoers of my age (and older) I grew up with James Bond. <em>License to Kill</em> (1989) was the first entry in the series I saw in a cinema, when I was 8 years of age. It may well have been before that that I had started to accumulate other Bond films, recorded off Christmas television for endless replaying on our top-loading Betamax machine.</p>\n<p>One of the great draws of these films is the famous components that one expects to find in each instalment. There is something comforting in the inevitable introduction: &ldquo;Bond, James Bond&rdquo;, in the familiar strains of that theme song, and in knowing our hero&rsquo;s drink order. When so many elements of the piece are predefined, from the surrealistic music video title sequence to the promise during the credits that &lsquo;James Bond will return&rsquo;, it might seem that the screenwriter and director have a relatively easy job on their hands. String together a few action scenes set in exotic locales, add a dose of sex, a fist fight, and a car chase or two and send the thing out wrapped in a bow-tie. Looked at another way however, all of those expected elements are also constraints, waypoint markers from which the filmmakers must not stray too far.</p>\n<p>This is the balance with which the two Bond films preceding <em>Skyfall</em> struggled. <em>Casino Royale</em> (2006), by taking Ian Fleming&rsquo;s first Bond novel as its template, was rooted in the history of the character, but also sought to reboot the franchise with a grittier tone more akin to that established by Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass in the first two Jason Bourne films for Universal. Whilst many of the familiar tropes were in place the film, and its sequel <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008), lacked the wit that had characterised many of the series' previous entries. It felt as though the films' creators were trying to wrestle all of the franchise&rsquo;s peccadilloes into a new form, which left the results feeling straight-jacketed and unfulfilling. The post-Bourne, post-War on Terror straight-facedness of this new Bond did well at the box office and won over more than a few critics, but did so at the expense of some of the more human traits of the character and the series as a whole.</p>\n<p>This is clearly a problem with which screenwriters John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade, and director Sam Mendes engaged in shaping <em>Skyfall</em>. From the script level up the film is proudly indebted to its ancestry, and manages to go about the work of updating it in a more sure-footed manner than its two immediate predecessors. Instead of wholesale adoption of other series' stylistic choices the film takes the time to actively engage with Bond&rsquo;s past and to assess what place the character has in the modern world, and by extension modern cinema. So, whilst the film reintroduces the role of Q (sorely missing in the two Craig outings thus far), it makes explicit with a couple of lines of dialogue that there will be no &lsquo;exploding pens&rsquo; of the type wielded by Pierce Brosnan in <em>GoldenEye</em> (1995). The iconic Aston Martin DB5 is reprised as Bond&rsquo;s car of choice, and the advent of a new Miss Moneypenny is welcome, as is her reinvention as a capable former field agent.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that <em>Skyfall</em> is hands-down the most strikingly beautiful Bond movie to date. Mendes&rsquo;s style is impressively assured: his confidence in the material signalled by the use of a signature musical sting accompanying the film&rsquo;s very first image, and his confidence in Bond as an icon extending to a willingness to let key scenes play out entirely in silhouette. The film also marks yet another impressive entry in the exemplary career of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Many of the locations (especially Shanghai and Macau) and the shots that establish them are nothing short of breathtaking. But the real strength of <em>Skyfall</em> is the surety with which it navigates the balance of nostalgia and modernisation. Now entering its sixth decade as a film franchise it is remarkable that Sam Mendes has crafted a movie that balances the past and future of Bond so perfectly. The script, in the wording of Bond&rsquo;s (premature) obituary, openly recognises the character&rsquo;s role as &ldquo;emblematic of British fortitude&rdquo;, and the sense of Bond as symbol is strong throughout. He&rsquo;s compared by Q to an old warship, and equated by the film&rsquo;s villain with an antiquated way of doing things. At each turn the film is examining how and whether Bond fits.</p>\n<p>The film&rsquo;s villain is also a device through which Bond&rsquo;s own place is examined. A former agent and a previous protégé of M&rsquo;s, Silva is a mirror image of Bond. Like Conrad’s (&amp; Coppolla&rsquo;s) Kurtz  he is a brilliant operative gone rogue - at once a reminder and an indictment of the rules within which Bond exists. Previous villains in the series are roughly divisible into two categories: those who attack Bond through influence of their minds (Blofeld, Goldfinger et al) and those who pose a physical threat (Jaws, Red Grant etc.). Silva is different in that he is principally a threat to Bond&rsquo;s heart &amp; soul. A similar trick is being played here as is performed in Chris Nolan&rsquo;s <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), in which The Joker&rsquo;s aim is squarely on undermining Batman&rsquo;s values before anything else. Here, as in Nolan&rsquo;s film, it serves to reveal truths about Bond&rsquo;s character. Whilst he fails every test of physical fitness and mental acuity required to return to active service, M gives her approval of 007&rsquo;s return to the field based on what she knows of his spirit - the second and third acts of the film are trials to Bond through which M&rsquo;s judgement is proven correct. Bond is literally sent back to his roots, to the abandoned family home from which his trauma stems, and proves himself - within a stone&rsquo;s throw of his parents' gravestones - to be everything he attests to be. Mendes echoes the film&rsquo;s opening, in which Bond falls to his supposed death amid a surging river, by sending James back underwater to fight for his life - his self-proclaimed hobby of &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; put to the test.</p>\n<p>And with <em>Skyfall</em> Mendes has brought new purpose to a franchise which had felt somewhat directionless in recent years. Unquestionably a new Bond, but one that feels firmly grounded in an understanding of and and acceptance of the character&rsquo;s place in cinema history.  Bond&rsquo;s inclusion in the 2012 London Olympics' opening ceremony is a sign of his iconic status not just in British culture but universally. The lines from Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; that feature prominently at the culmination of the film&rsquo;s second act, seem to speak directly to the question of Britain&rsquo;s place in the modern world, and also to the matter of James Bond&rsquo;s place in modern cinema.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are not now that strength which in the old days<br>\nMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are,<br>\nOne equal-temper of heroic hearts,<br>\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is also that line, repeated by several characters throughout the film and easily read as a direct acknowledgement that not every change has been for the better: &ldquo;Sometimes the old ways are the best&rdquo;.

When I start the machine up and enter my login password, instead of displaying the Apple logo for a while whilst booting up I&rsquo;ve been getting strings of white-on-black text streaming down the left side of the screen&hellip; then a message that the machine needs to restart.</p>\n<p>A little poking around has enabled me to find out that this error is called a &lsquo;kernel panic&rsquo;, though I haven&rsquo;t got very far in determining what causes it. It seems kernel panics can be brought on by any number of problems, either with a system&rsquo;s hardware or its software. I&rsquo;ve kept the report logs from the crashes but they&rsquo;re more or less indecipherable to me - which is where the experts come in.</p>\n<p>Today I had an appointment at my nearest Genius Bar and took my MacBook in to be looked at. (Just FYI: it&rsquo;s a late 2010 model w/ 4GB of RAM, running OS X Mountain Lion.) The guy who looked at it for me had all the info I&rsquo;d sent through at hand on an iPad, but that and the logs he pulled up from the console didn&rsquo;t give a definitive picture of where the problem lay. I was half expecting them to say that it wasn&rsquo;t a diagnosable problem and tell me to come back if it got worse. But that isn&rsquo;t the way that Apple do business: there was no question that they needed to get to the bottom of the issue, so I had to sign the computer into their care for a few days.</p>\n<p>Leaving the Apple store without my Mac, knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t have it to hand for at least a few days (maybe as long as three weeks) felt very odd. I found myself immediately calculating what the implications would be for my daily digital activities. Most things I balance between Mac &amp; iPhone anyway, depending upon which is to hand: email, Twitter, RSS feeds etc. All of my music is still on tap thanks to Spotify and iTunes Match; photos are all backed up to Dropbox and hence still available via iOS or any web browser; I can still post to Tumblr, Instagram et al via iPhone&hellip; I&rsquo;m still plugged in.</p>\n<p>Longform reading &amp; writing were likely to be the biggest hurdle. I&rsquo;ve never got used to reading lots of text on a phone screen; I uninstalled Instapaper through lack of use a while ago, tending instead to save articles to Pinboard to catch up with on a larger screen later. At this moment I&rsquo;m resigned to building up a bit of a backlog in this way, though I know I also have the option (via Instapaper) to send articles to my Kindle - that might be something worth playing with if the days without a laptop become weeks.</p>\n<p>Writing, on the other hand, I quickly found a workable solution to. The iOS version of Information Architects' <a href=\"http://www.iawriter.com\">iA Writer</a>, combined with a bluetooth connection to my wireless Mac keyboard makes for an ideal writing set-up: distraction free, and as comfortable as I choose to make it, it&rsquo;s also an ultra-portable way of working that I can take from the couch to the train without any hassle. There&rsquo;s an added bonus: my Documents folder on my MacBook is symlinked to Dropbox, to which iA Writer has full read / write access, so I still have all of my docs to hand and editable. Since I write pretty much everything in markdown format these days plaintext isn&rsquo;t even really a limitation.</p>\n<p>OK, right now I&rsquo;m going to post this to Wordpress via the beautiful and super-useful iOS app Poster. I&rsquo;ll keep you updated on life without a laptop. How it limits or changes my online life, whether it makes me think differently about the mobile web, and whether I should be making such a big deal about this in the first place!</p>\n",

I was half expecting them to say that it wasn't a diagnosable problem and tell me to come back if it got worse. But that isn't the way that Apple do business: there was no question that they needed to get to the bottom of the issue, so I had to sign the computer into their care for a few days. \n\nLeaving the Apple store without my Mac, knowing that I wouldn't have it to hand for at least a few days (maybe as long as three weeks) felt very odd. I found myself immediately calculating what the implications would be for my daily digital activities. Most things I balance between Mac & iPhone anyway, depending upon which is to hand: email, Twitter, RSS feeds etc. All of my music is still on tap thanks to Spotify and iTunes Match; photos are all backed up to Dropbox and hence still available via iOS or any web browser; I can still post to Tumblr, Instagram et al via iPhone... I'm still plugged in. \n\nLongform reading & writing were likely to be the biggest hurdle. I've never got used to reading lots of text on a phone screen; I uninstalled Instapaper through lack of use a while ago, tending instead to save articles to Pinboard to catch up with on a larger screen later. At this moment I'm resigned to building up a bit of a backlog in this way, though I know I also have the option (via Instapaper) to send articles to my Kindle - that might be something worth playing with if the days without a laptop become weeks. \n\nWriting, on the other hand, I quickly found a workable solution to. The iOS version of Information Architects' [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com), combined with a bluetooth connection to my wireless Mac keyboard makes for an ideal writing set-up: distraction free, and as comfortable as I choose to make it, it's also an ultra-portable way of working that I can take from the couch to the train without any hassle. There's an added bonus: my Documents folder on my MacBook is symlinked to Dropbox, to which iA Writer has full read / write access, so I still have all of my docs to hand and editable. Since I write pretty much everything in markdown format these days plaintext isn't even really a limitation. \n\nOK, right now I'm going to post this to Wordpress via the beautiful and super-useful iOS app Poster. I'll keep you updated on life without a laptop. How it limits or changes my online life, whether it makes me think differently about the mobile web, and whether I should be making such a big deal about this in the first place!\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-cold-war-kids--mine-is-yours\">20. Cold War Kids — <em>Mine Is Yours</em></h3>\n<p>This was a crazy sleeper for me, and even now it just creeps in at the bottom. Much as I love the first two records from this band (and the EP from last year for that matter), this album never clicked for me. If it were an album by a new band I would have given up on it after a couple of listens, but I know what CWK are capable of, and after a half-dozen plays I started to find it. There&rsquo;s still good stuff here, it just feels a little more dilute than previously, and certain tracks (e.g. &lsquo;Royal Blue&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Sensitive Kid&rsquo;) are plain irksome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-rival-schools--pedals\">19. Rival Schools — <em>Pedals</em></h3>\n<p>A long time coming, and in some respects it&rsquo;s like they never went away. Schreifels' voice is immediately recognisable, and still has the same emotive power and limited range as previously; the sonic make-up of the album as a whole is very similar to <em>United By Fate</em>. That there is a span of 10 years separating the records and yet they sound like they could be from the same recording session is about all there is to know. I&rsquo;m still fond of this music, but it&rsquo;s a nostalgic fondness; it would have been nice to have seen some experimentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-rem--collapse-into-now\">18. R.E.M. — <em>Collapse Into Now</em></h3>\n<p>And so it comes to pass that one of the most long-standing and consistently interesting rock bands calls time on its career. When the album was released we didn&rsquo;t know it would be R.E.M.&rsquo;s final studio record, which is to its benefit as it deserves to be assessed on its own merits. What we have here is not revolutionary, not nearly a match for their finest work, not quite a match for 2008&rsquo;s <em>Accelerate</em>, and yet it&rsquo;s beautifully made and possessed of many great moments and a couple of great songs. The legacy was set in stone by 1992, but this isn&rsquo;t a bad noise to go out to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-say-hi-to-your-mom--um-uh-oh\">17. Say Hi To Your Mom — <em>Um, Uh Oh</em></h3>\n<p>A seemingly effortless encapsulation of all that is best in so-called &lsquo;indie&rsquo; music, without falling into the genre&rsquo;s worst traits. Opener &lsquo;Dots On Maps&rsquo; is one of the year&rsquo;s catchiest singer-songwriter efforts, and it&rsquo;s followed, in &lsquo;Devils&rsquo;, by a song groovier than one man making music in his apartment has a right to be. This LP is shot through with charm and neat observation, great lyricism and catchy tunes that feel sculpted in the ease with which they sit warmly atop the brain. Zero pretention, just great songs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-j-live--spta-said-person-of-that-ability\">16. J-Live — <em>S.P.T.A. (Said Person Of That Ability)</em></h3>\n<p>My discovery of J-Live&rsquo;s <em>All of the Above</em> stands as one of the formative moments in my love of hip-hop; alongside Buck 65&rsquo;s <em>Square</em>, and Edan&rsquo;s <em>Primitive Plus</em> it expanded my ideas about what rap was capable of. I&rsquo;ve been waiting almost 10 years for him to match it, and despite good moments with the last two albums (2005 &amp; &lsquo;08) it was clear from first listen that this was the record I&rsquo;d been hoping for. Laid-back, smooth delivery combined with dense, intelligent lyricism and warm beats make this easy to listen to and rewarding to re-listen to. Great stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-tv-on-the-radio--nine-types-of-light\">15. TV On The Radio — <em>Nine Types Of Light</em></h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a consistent level of quality that you know you&rsquo;re going to get from a TVOTR record, and <em>Nine Types Of Light</em> doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The material here, if not quite as instantly memorable as that on <em>Dear Science</em>, is wall-to-wall engaging rhythms and hum-along vocal lines. You&rsquo;d have to try hard not to be charmed by this music, and though it doesn&rsquo;t completely live up to the standard of its predecessor it&rsquo;s still of enormously high-quality. (R.I.P. Gerard Smith)</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-floex--zorya\">14. Floex — <em>Zorya</em></h3>\n<p>On which one-man Czech electronica producer Tomáš Dvoák creates some of the most enchanting, beautiful music of 2011. Almost tidal in its gentle pacing, but enhanced with elements such as a jazz clarinet (&lsquo;Casanova&rsquo;) or an ethereal female vocal (&lsquo;Nel Blu&rsquo;) this caught hold of me straight away. The string heavy &lsquo;Veronika&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;, and the impressively lyrical &lsquo;Precious Creature&rsquo; are highlights for me on an album I loved from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-wild-flag--wild-flag\">13. Wild Flag — <em>Wild Flag</em></h3>\n<p>This record came as an unexpected pleasure: one of the year&rsquo;s best surprises. Having heard the single &lsquo;Glass Tambourine&rsquo; from SXSW coverage I had been waiting impatiently for the album to come out, not really knowing what to expect from it. I hadn&rsquo;t dared to hope that it would be of quite this high a quality, devoid of any pretention about its genesis, and just this much pure fun. This is joyful pop-rock made by musicians who sound like they&rsquo;re having a lot of fun doing so. There&rsquo;s a bushel of excellent 3-minute pop songs, balanced with a couple of more ambitious tracks like &lsquo;Racehorse&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s a balance that works perfectly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-lykke-li--wounded-rhymes\">12. Lykke Li — <em>Wounded Rhymes</em></h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago I downloaded the second Bat For Lashes LP not really knowing what to expect from a follow-up to such a singular debut. I found myself in a similar position on release day for the second Lykke Li album: was it going to sound like <em>Youth Novels</em>, or (a, seemingly, equally likely scenario) was she going to spin out in a completely different direction altogether? In the end it turns out that the former is closer to the truth, though <em>Wounded Rhymes</em> exhibits a sure-footedness beyond the idiosyncrasies of the first album, and perhaps a touch of darkness that wasn&rsquo;t present before. That&rsquo;s not to say that this is Lykke Li&rsquo;s <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, but there&rsquo;s a notable shift to darker tones in some places, even if the music remains pleasingly wrapped around bombastic percussion and pretty, melancholic vocal lines. Turns out that&rsquo;s all she had to do this time - but what&rsquo;s next?</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-foo-fighters--wasting-light\">11. Foo Fighters — <em>Wasting Light</em></h3>\n<p>Holy smokes? This has been a long time coming. Speaking as someone who adored the first three Foos records, and has endured everything since 1999 with decreasing levels of interest and rising levels of contempt, <em>Wasting Light</em> comes as something of a surprise, and a very welcome one. To me this is a turn around of almost (not quite) <em>Death Magnetic</em> proportions: a genuinely exciting rock album full of grade-A riffs, powerfully delivered vocals (and lyrics that don&rsquo;t (always) suck), and a self-assuredness earned after 15+ years in the business. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier that Grohl et al made this album; I honestly doubted that they still had it in them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-emmy-the-great--virtue\">10. Emmy The Great — <em>Virtue</em></h3>\n<p>Spoiler time: there is no Laura Marling album on this list. For whatever reason <em>A Creature I Do Not Know</em> failed to capture my imagination much: it seemed to be lacking the infectiousness of Marling&rsquo;s first two albums, ending up feeling a little watered-down and less than vital. By contrast Emmy The Great&rsquo;s second album is thrillingly alive, rich in colour and packed with wonderful tunes. There&rsquo;s a joy to this music, and it&rsquo;s delivered with unmistakable passion, but it&rsquo;s also tonally diverse: &lsquo;Creation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Iris&rsquo; seemingly belong at different ends of a spectrum, but they are both built assuredly with the tools of an impressive songwriter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-battles--gloss-drop\">9. Battles — <em>Gloss Drop</em></h3>\n<p>Nothing all year sounded like this. Maybe nothing since Battles&rsquo; debut sounded like this. I was somewhat worried, last year, by the departure from the band of Tyondai Braxton: it seemed an obvious equation at the time that a Battles LP without him would be something lesser than the debut, but for whatever reason it hasn&rsquo;t worked out that way. <em>Gloss Drop</em> contains more energy and freneticism than any three other art-rock records combined (John Stanier&rsquo;s drumming in particular is, frankly, ridiculous), and the very fact that it&rsquo;s harnessed into roughly song-shaped bursts between one and eight minutes is impressive. This record comes across like the love child of Mars Volta &amp; The Go! Team, but with more glitter and streamers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-das-racist--relax\">8. Das Racist — <em>Relax</em></h3>\n<p>So, my favourite hip-hop LP of the year is from an NY trio with a penchant for obscure humour and a talent for word-play so intricate that it takes weeks of re-listens to begin to pick it apart. And then all that is true about <em>this</em> record too. Relax has been on repeat for me for a long while as I switch my favourite lines on almost every listen and always find something new that makes me smile with how clever or arch it is. The production is all warm synths and crunchy beats, and all three members have the sort of laid-back flow that makes me fall in love with listening to this record first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening: a great wind-up/down album and one of my most listened to in the latter half of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-pj-harvey--let-england-shake\">7. PJ Harvey — <em>Let England Shake</em></h3>\n<p>I can hear it now: the glockenspiel melody that opens this album is one of 2011&rsquo;s most indelible sounds. Unfortunately, for me, the horn which ruins the next track of the album is a close runner-up. But that&rsquo;s one misstep on an otherwise masterful record of truly haunting, thought-provoking and beautiful music. Musically complex and unafraid of difficulty, the album remains accessible by virtue of being so pretty almost throughout. It&rsquo;s by no means an optimistic album, but there&rsquo;s a lot of life in there and I always felt I came away from listening to it feeling like I&rsquo;d gained something.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-bright-eyes--the-peoples-key\">6. Bright Eyes — <em>The People&rsquo;s Key</em></h3>\n<p>Though a little more rock-oriented than much of their previous output this record is unmistakably from the people who brought you <em>Lifted…</em> and <em>I&rsquo;m Wide Awake, It&rsquo;s Morning</em>. The vocal delivery is instantly recognisable, the lyrical smarts are present and correct, the rousing choruses are in place and we&rsquo;re all set for another super-enjoyable Bright Eyes record. I enjoyed walking around listening to this one, humming parts of it, singing others. It feels expansive (and not just because of the liberally used echoey production), assured and unafraid to be positive. &lsquo;Shell Games&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jejune Stars&rsquo; may be two of my favourite songs from the Omaha lot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-the-beastie-boys--hot-sauce-committee-pt-2\">5. The Beastie Boys — <em>Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2</em></h3>\n<p>It was on, it was off, it changed its title, re-arranged its tracklist (and then rearranged it back)… but it was worth waiting for. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that <em>To The 5 Boroughs</em> is seven years old (and <em>Hello Nasty</em> 13!), and putting the kind of forgettable instrumental album from &lsquo;07 aside this is the first we&rsquo;ve heard from the Boys in all that time. The fact that any doubts are set aside within literally the first 11 seconds of the album came as a huge relief, and from there on in it&rsquo;s just a masterclass in goofy wordplay, infectious beats, and raps about food. Sometimes a quick flick through <em>Spin</em> or <em>Pitchfork</em> has me feeling that musicians right now are far too concerned with how they dress, and their &lsquo;image&rsquo; in general - fine, but it seems to impact the music, and make for a lot of self-serious, super-credible albums that lack a sense of fun. The Beasties have been the answer to that for a while, and whether it&rsquo;s the hardcore-esque &lsquo;Lee Majors Come Again&rsquo;, the slow groove of &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s A Little Something For Ya&rsquo;, or the built-for-a-ghetto-blaster &lsquo;Make Some Noise&rsquo;… no one else does it quite like them. There&rsquo;s another album full of this stuff in the locker, and you&rsquo;ll be seeing it on this list next year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-radiohead--the-king-of-limbs--tkol-rmx-12345678\">4. Radiohead — <em>The King of Limbs</em> (&amp; <em>TKOL RMX 1234567(8)</em>)</h3>\n<p>Long awaited and yet unexpected, this was another surprise release strategy from Radiohead which brought us an album that felt instantly familiar and yet no less impressive for it. Around the album&rsquo;s release I read a bunch of comparisons to <em>The Eraser</em>, and that feels apt, though <em>TKOL</em> feels warmer, a little less downcast. The album has some serious swing to it (e.g. &lsquo;Little by Little&rsquo;), and moments of real beauty (e.g. &lsquo;Lotus Flower&rsquo;) - this feels like a band harnessing the power of <em>Kid A</em> / <em>Amnesiac</em> for good, a project they arguably started with <em>In Rainbows</em> but which is in full bloom now (pun intended).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m cheating here a little bit by including the set of 8 remix EPs that were released throughout the summer and autumn. I was constantly impressed with what other artists brought out of the tracks from <em>TKOL</em>, whether it was turning &lsquo;Give Up The Ghost&rsquo; into a trance floor-filler or making &lsquo;Bloom&rsquo; sound like it was going to kick your teeth in, it made me see the Radiohead album in a bunch of new lights and really enhanced my enjoyment of it. I probably listened to the remixes more than the original in the latter half of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-feist--metals\">3. Feist — <em>Metals</em></h3>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this. I enjoyed <em>The Reminder</em>, though I came to it too late to get caught up in its spell of omnipresence in 2007. Perhaps as a result Feist has taken a back seat in my mind to Chan Marshall and Regina Spektor; it was immediately clear from my first listen to this album that that wasn&rsquo;t fair. <em>Metals</em> is a gentle, measured record filled with sunlight and beauty - it&rsquo;s truly a joyful listening experience. Both the instrumentation and production are warm and inviting; Feist&rsquo;s voice is capable of impressive range and has a great inner strength to it which carries these songs skipping along irresistibly. &lsquo;A Commotion&rsquo; is quite brilliantly agitated, and &lsquo;The Circle Married the Line&rsquo; is surpassing beautiful, and they are but two highlights on a flawless document of incredible talent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-björk--biophilia\">2. Björk — <em>Biophilia</em></h3>\n<p>Nothing I could say about this album could make it appeal to you if you&rsquo;re not already interested in Björk&rsquo;s continuing project to find new forms of musical expression. I could use terms like gravity harp, Tesla-coil organ, and MIDI-controlled gamelan–celesta hybrid… but you&rsquo;re unlikely to care if you didn&rsquo;t already find Björk fascinating. This album, a concept record dealing with life&rsquo;s place in the universe, is perhaps less accessible than 2007&rsquo;s dancier <em>Volta</em>, and is certainly full of music that would rightly be considered difficult. I can only say that I&rsquo;ve had some of the best listening experiences of my year with this album and I find it endlessly fascinating, stunningly ambitious, and as close to genius as music came in 2011.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-le-butcherettes--sin-sin-sin\">1. Le Butcherettes — <em>Sin Sin Sin</em></h3>\n<p>This came out of nowhere, a mention post-SXSW that Omar Rodriguez Lopez had signed the first band to his new label, produced the record, and played bass on it. That was enough to ensure that I put it on my mental list, and when I finally caught up with it my socks were well and truly blown off. There are similarities to Distillers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and maybe even a touch of SoaD in there too - but in truth <em>Sin, Sin, Sin</em> sounds entirely of itself. The sound of a passionate bunch of people making music with heart is impossible to fake, and in his production of this album Rodriguez Lopez has been sensible enough to capture it whole and not mess with it. Pretty much every time I put this on I had to listen through it; there&rsquo;s not a weak track amongst the feisty bunch.\nSo, 39 minutes of ridiculously catchy hooks, twisted-genius lyrics, and volcanic levels of energy… there&rsquo;s your album of the year.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Cold War Kids — *Mine Is Yours*\n\nThis was a crazy sleeper for me, and even now it just creeps in at the bottom. Much as I love the first two records from this band (and the EP from last year for that matter), this album never clicked for me. If it were an album by a new band I would have given up on it after a couple of listens, but I know what CWK are capable of, and after a half-dozen plays I started to find it. There's still good stuff here, it just feels a little more dilute than previously, and certain tracks (e.g. 'Royal Blue' & 'Sensitive Kid') are plain irksome. \n\n###  19. Rival Schools — *Pedals*\n\nA long time coming, and in some respects it's like they never went away. Schreifels' voice is immediately recognisable, and still has the same emotive power and limited range as previously; the sonic make-up of the album as a whole is very similar to *United By Fate*. That there is a span of 10 years separating the records and yet they sound like they could be from the same recording session is about all there is to know. I'm still fond of this music, but it's a nostalgic fondness; it would have been nice to have seen some experimentation.\n\n###  18. R.E.M. — *Collapse Into Now*\n\nAnd so it comes to pass that one of the most long-standing and consistently interesting rock bands calls time on its career. When the album was released we didn't know it would be R.E.M.'s final studio record, which is to its benefit as it deserves to be assessed on its own merits. What we have here is not revolutionary, not nearly a match for their finest work, not quite a match for 2008's *Accelerate*, and yet it's beautifully made and possessed of many great moments and a couple of great songs. The legacy was set in stone by 1992, but this isn't a bad noise to go out to. \n\n###  17. Say Hi To Your Mom — *Um, Uh Oh*\n\nA seemingly effortless encapsulation of all that is best in so-called 'indie' music, without falling into the genre's worst traits. Opener 'Dots On Maps' is one of the year's catchiest singer-songwriter efforts, and it's followed, in 'Devils', by a song groovier than one man making music in his apartment has a right to be. This LP is shot through with charm and neat observation, great lyricism and catchy tunes that feel sculpted in the ease with which they sit warmly atop the brain. Zero pretention, just great songs. \n\n###  16. J-Live — *S.P.T.A. (Said Person Of That Ability)*\n\nMy discovery of J-Live's *All of the Above* stands as one of the formative moments in my love of hip-hop; alongside Buck 65's *Square*, and Edan's *Primitive Plus* it expanded my ideas about what rap was capable of. I've been waiting almost 10 years for him to match it, and despite good moments with the last two albums (2005 & '08) it was clear from first listen that this was the record I'd been hoping for. Laid-back, smooth delivery combined with dense, intelligent lyricism and warm beats make this easy to listen to and rewarding to re-listen to. Great stuff. \n\n###  15. TV On The Radio — *Nine Types Of Light*\n\nThere's a consistent level of quality that you know you're going to get from a TVOTR record, and *Nine Types Of Light* doesn't disappoint. The material here, if not quite as instantly memorable as that on *Dear Science*, is wall-to-wall engaging rhythms and hum-along vocal lines. You'd have to try hard not to be charmed by this music, and though it doesn't completely live up to the standard of its predecessor it's still of enormously high-quality. (R.I.P. Gerard Smith)\n\n###  14. Floex — *Zorya*\n\nOn which one-man Czech electronica producer Tomáš Dvoák creates some of the most enchanting, beautiful music of 2011. Almost tidal in its gentle pacing, but enhanced with elements such as a jazz clarinet ('Casanova') or an ethereal female vocal ('Nel Blu') this caught hold of me straight away. The string heavy 'Veronika's Dream', and the impressively lyrical 'Precious Creature' are highlights for me on an album I loved from start to finish.\n\n###  13. Wild Flag — *Wild Flag*\n\nThis record came as an unexpected pleasure: one of the year's best surprises.

There's a bushel of excellent 3-minute pop songs, balanced with a couple of more ambitious tracks like 'Racehorse', and it's a balance that works perfectly. \n\n###  12. Lykke Li — *Wounded Rhymes*\n\nA couple of years ago I downloaded the second Bat For Lashes LP not really knowing what to expect from a follow-up to such a singular debut. I found myself in a similar position on release day for the second Lykke Li album: was it going to sound like *Youth Novels*, or (a, seemingly, equally likely scenario) was she going to spin out in a completely different direction altogether? In the end it turns out that the former is closer to the truth, though *Wounded Rhymes* exhibits a sure-footedness beyond the idiosyncrasies of the first album, and perhaps a touch of darkness that wasn't present before.

To me this is a turn around of almost (not quite) *Death Magnetic* proportions: a genuinely exciting rock album full of grade-A riffs, powerfully delivered vocals (and lyrics that don't (always) suck), and a self-assuredness earned after 15+ years in the business. I couldn't be happier that Grohl et al made this album; I honestly doubted that they still had it in them. \n\n###  10. Emmy The Great — *Virtue*\n\nSpoiler time: there is no Laura Marling album on this list. For whatever reason *A Creature I Do Not Know* failed to capture my imagination much: it seemed to be lacking the infectiousness of Marling's first two albums, ending up feeling a little watered-down and less than vital. By contrast Emmy The Great's second album is thrillingly alive, rich in colour and packed with wonderful tunes. There's a joy to this music, and it's delivered with unmistakable passion, but it's also tonally diverse: 'Creation' and 'Iris' seemingly belong at different ends of a spectrum, but they are both built assuredly with the tools of an impressive songwriter. \n\n###  9. Battles — *Gloss Drop*\n\nNothing all year sounded like this. Maybe nothing since Battles' debut sounded like this. I was somewhat worried, last year, by the departure from the band of Tyondai Braxton: it seemed an obvious equation at the time that a Battles LP without him would be something lesser than the debut, but for whatever reason it hasn't worked out that way. *Gloss Drop* contains more energy and freneticism than any three other art-rock records combined (John Stanier's drumming in particular is, frankly, ridiculous), and the very fact that it's harnessed into roughly song-shaped bursts between one and eight minutes is impressive. This record comes across like the love child of Mars Volta & The Go! Team, but with more glitter and streamers. \n\n###  8. Das Racist — *Relax*\n\nSo, my favourite hip-hop LP of the year is from an NY trio with a penchant for obscure humour and a talent for word-play so intricate that it takes weeks of re-listens to begin to pick it apart.

				"title": "Donkey Wayside Mortuary — An Interview with Ofelia Hunt",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/dadbf701ac.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ofelia Hunt is the author of the novel <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em>, recently published by Magic Helicopter Press, as well as several poems and short stories scattered around the internet. The following interview was conducted via a series of emails.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><strong>Adam Wood</strong>: For the most part I’m going to pretend I didn’t see the copyright page in the front of the book, though I kind of had to look after that line on your blog that says ‘Ofelia Hunt may not be 100% real.’ Is that the first thing everybody asks? Do you think people get too hung up on the pseudonym thing?</p>\n<p><strong>Ofelia Hunt</strong>: I don’t know. The name Ofelia Hunt sounds (to me) like a fake name (it was based originally on an old Police drama, <em>Hunter</em>—I had recurring thoughts of the show, was wondering how it had disappeared). I do fear somebody will get pissed at me and start shouting, like, ‘authenticity’ and try to slap me with an oar or throw kittens, at a reading, perhaps. I could have a depressive breakdown at the microphone, and begin sobbing about alcoholism and the patriarchy.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: This is your first novel, but you’ve published a bunch of poetry and some short stories with Bear Parade before now. Did you find it different writing a novel, and how did the decision to do that come about?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I hate when people say something ‘occurred organically’, or whatever. So I’ll say this: I’ve always wanted to write novels. I’ve written three and half other novel/novella type things that weren’t very good or which lost their energy part way through. I felt like the stories in Bear Parade were a great way to prepare for a novel. In my head, the stories and the novel all have the same narrator. She may have different names or live in different places, but she’s the same person. Her style of narration evolved, in terms of sentence structure, paragraphing, etc… as I edited <em>T&amp;T</em>. But I feel like <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> could be read in conjunction. Or as a footnote or something. To some degree, the poems I wrote around that time are the same character as well. I’ve read that some writers map out, outline, or even write out character histories. I don’t, but the short stories and poems formed a sort of foundation for <em>T&amp;T</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve read in interviews that you wrote most of the short stories that make up <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> in one sitting. How did you approach writing when it came to the novel: a chapter at a time?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: All the stories in <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> are maybe 300-900 words long. This is about the maximum I can write in one sitting, while still having time to edit and come up with something I will like (at least in the moment).</p>\n<p>For the first draft I wrote straight through, chapter by chapter. I had this conception there would be two parts of twelve chapters, for twenty-four total, maybe representing an hour for each chapter, but only loosely. I wrote every day, about 500 words a day. I edited everything I had written before writing the next 500 words until this began to take too long, then I edited only the previous day’s work before writing new words. I also edited while writing. And then edited straight through several times. According to my Word document properties dialog box, the final version I have was revised 159 times with a total revision time of 65,230 minutes. I don’t know what that means.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Your characters–and especially your narrator–seem to latch onto thoughts or words or sounds, and those things come up again and again. Does that come from an interest in how language works, or how certain people think? What’s behind that?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m very interested in how language works, how people work, how people work with language. Sometimes I imagine words on a tape (think 1950s computer technology) being fed into a person, by way of ear or mouth, in a sort of programming, and wonder what happens to the people after that. In a way, this is how I interact with people. Constant testing. I have difficulty communicating with other humans, especially when I first meet someone. It’s like I have to test, test, test, and find a new method each time. And in my head I often hear recurring words or phrases. I’m prone to repeating them over and over, as though the phrase itself is a joke. For example: “dollar dollar bills.” I used to walk up to friends I knew and repeat these phrases aloud and then walk away. I woke up this morning thinking, “donkey wayside mortuary.” Perhaps this is garbage language. Maybe I’m interested in garbage language. Where it comes from, where it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I think there’s certainly a heavy reliance on ‘naturalism’ in popular literature, and that comes at the expense of exploring other ideas of how people actually think and speak. Dialogue (internal and otherwise) like yours strikes the ear as authentic precisely because it contains all of these little loops and flaws.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yeah, realism/naturalism seem very concerned with creating a digestible whole, where each image/dialog/thought fits together all puzzle-like and calculated. Like a little machine you wind up and ride to epiphany. I feel ashamed to have typed that, a little, as I generally avoid similes. But maybe language, or garbage language can work machine-like also, or like dozens of machines, crawling from little round mouths.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: There’s a moment in the novel when the narrator says “I push piano-keys in a rhythmic way but with no regard for sound or beauty” (p.52). That kind of unlocked the novel for me, I think. There’s all this repetition and the writing pulls the reader along really powerfully, but without regard for traditional plot or narrative arcs. Would you say you’re more interested in how it ‘feels’ to read your writing as opposed to what it ‘means’?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yes. The idea that a ‘text’ could be easily interpreted into ‘meaning’ has always bothered me. Traditional narrative arcs are very predictable. By way of television, schooling, ‘genre’ (whatever that means), news media, we (or at least I) are/was indoctrinated into this very basic structure. I feel infuriated when a news report takes a very complex issue and turns into a digestible narrative arc: the US economy has slowed because of X or Y. Now we can ‘like’ it or not. Now we know who to blame. I hate the feeling of knowing what will happen next. I want to be surprised at every moment.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: That’s increasingly true of every sphere of life, I think: that binary reductivism. Do you think it’s your wish to be surprised that leads you to reject traditional plotting?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I think that’s part of it. Traditional plotting also involves a lot of planning. A lot of reshaping the text to fit the constraint of the narrative arc. I’m not interested in it enough to do it well. I’m more interested in writing sentences that sound how I think sentences should sound (at least mine), and assembling those sentences together in a way that pleases me. This leads me towards surprise (a lot of humor for me is surprise) and perhaps emotion.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve been describing the novel to people as kind of Kmart realism but with particular tendencies towards violence. Does that seem fair? How do you think of the book if you think of it in those terms at all?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: When I was small, my parents took me to Kmart to buy shoes. I don’t think in those terms, but I do admire the ‘Kmart Realists’. Anne Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, Joy Williams, Raymond Carver. Maybe Sartre can fall into this type of category in terms of stylistic representation of ‘reality’. Marguerite Duras? Robbe-Grillet? I know that in writing <em>T&amp;T</em>, I was very focused on attempting to represent how a mind works. I was reading a lot of Jean Rhys. I was thinking about the realism of Stephen Dixon’s writing. Stephen Dixon is probably the best I’ve read at representing a mind at work. Particularly in <em>Interstate</em>, which is a horrifically close third person. I wanted to write horrifically close first person. I want to experience ‘reality’ as an other.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Have you read Nicholson Baker also? He’s very interested in the intimate details, but the language is less spontaneous, more studied, almost essayistic.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I haven’t, though I just now read a little from <em>The Mezzanine</em> online. I like the singular focus on details, and the way they seem to swarm together, as though each little detail is more important than any character.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I read about this thing at Stanford called the Lit Lab, where they built a piece of software that analyses writing. They feed in all of these novels and plays and poems and this thing is slowly learning how to categorise literature on a purely empirical basis, instead of cognitively or emotionally, like a human might.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I like that idea. I think <em>T&amp;T</em> might get categorized as a YA novel maybe, because of the fairly simple sentence structures, and maybe elementary school level word choice.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: You know Pirooz Kalayeh and Tao Lin, right? Are you involved at all with the film they’re making of Tao’s novella <em>Shoplifting from American Apparel</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m not involved with that, but I am excited to see the film. And also to see <em>The Human War</em>, another Pirooz Kalayeh film based on the novel by Noah Cicero.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Seems like <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em> would be almost impossible to film because so much of it is internal to the narrator’s experience. It would make a great audiobook though; is there a Hollywood actress you would like to record an audiobook version?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I agree. Any film of <em>T&amp;T</em> would probably be doomed by its lack of plotting. Not much happens that’s filmable and there’d have to be a ton of voiceover. I think the audiobook could be read very effectively by many actors: Frances McDormand (<em>Blood Simple</em>), Joan Chen (<em>Twin Peaks</em>), Scarlett Johansson (<em>Lost in Translation</em>), Felicia Pearson (<em>The Wire</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: What’s next for you? I assume you’re someone for whom writing is an almost daily part of life, regardless of whether you’ve got a ‘project’ in mind, but is there anything particular you’re working towards?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m working on something that might be a novella, currently titled <em>Voltron</em> which might be about trailer parks. I’m also writing a series of short stories called <em>Horrorcore</em>. So far these have been stories written in about one hour that feature creepy imagery. Maybe they’re related to Horrorcore rap/hip hop.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Ofelia, thanks for talking to me about all this.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Dude, thank you.</p>\n",

The movie had surprised and thrilled me, done things I&rsquo;d never seen on the screen before, and knocked me back in my seat with its last 20 minutes. Fincher&rsquo;s film was brave and brash and masculine, and — like Palahniuk&rsquo;s book — it challenged some assumptions about what it meant to be a man in the modern world. The psychoses resulting from the protagonist&rsquo;s breakdown fuel the movie, and really give you a picture of a person&rsquo;s mental state, as well as his time and place.

Nina Sayers is beset by all kinds of questions about her femininity: she has multiple body issues which are both shown in the film and hinted at in her past; her relationship with her mother is mutually overdependent to increasingly uncomfortable levels; her sexual repression inhibits her both emotionally and as a dancer.

In almost every scene of <em>Black Swan</em> we are presented with multiple Ninas, as Aronofsky&rsquo;s camera seeks out each mirror in every room. Rarely do we see Natalie Portman without <em>also</em> seeing her doubled, moving differently, from some other angle.

				"title": "The List 2010",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-ok-go--of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky\">20. OK Go — <em>Of the Blue Colour of the Sky</em></h3>\n<p>It’s a great feeling to be surprised by an album, and even more special when it happens more than once within the same record. Even having heard very little of the previous material I thought I had OK Go pegged: another spiky pop band in the Tapes n’ Tapes, Hot Hot Heat mould but with more innovative promo videos. It turns out there’s a lot more to the Chicago four-piece than that.</p>\n<p>As those self-made videos attest, this is a band bursting at the seams with ideas, and on this album they let rip with a multitude of styles, delivering dance-rock (‘This Too Shall Pass’), ballads (‘Skyscrapers’) and synth-pop (‘End Love’) among others. The album highlight is a toss-up between the shockingly on-the-money Prince tribute ‘White Knuckles’ and the surprisingly tender digital lament ‘Before the Earth was Round’. In some respects it’s shocking that those two songs exist on the same album. That OK Go attempt so much here and pull it off without a misstep is deserving of enormously impressive.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-the-posies--blood--candy\">19. The Posies — <em>Blood / Candy</em></h3>\n<p>Along with Brad’s <em>Interiors</em> (1997) and Screaming Trees’ <em>Dust</em> (1996), I treasure The Posies’ 1993 album <em>Frosting on the Beater</em> for having shaped something special out of the beautiful, melodic aspects of grunge without having felt it necessary to pretend at angst. I dipped into some of the band’s other records but didn’t find anything as consistently engaging. Likewise with albums since; I listened to 2005’s <em>Every Kind of Light</em> a fair bit, but I honestly don’t remember whether it claimed a place on my year end List.</p>\n<p>Having taken a bit of a break since then it seems that some of the old magic has been recaptured. <em>Blood / Candy</em> is a set of three and four-minute easygoing pop gems with just the right touch of melancholic edge to them. Opener ‘Plastic Paperbacks’ is expertly judged, and enough by itself to assure you that this is a band (having been recording since the late 80s) in full command of their talents. The subtle mood-swings of ‘Cleopatra Street’ are further proof that The Posies are capable of pretty much anything they turn their mind to, and the three and half minutes of ‘For The Ashes’ prove it, crafting something heartbreaking and huge-seeming out of very little.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-flying-lotus--cosmogramma\">18. Flying Lotus — <em>Cosmogramma</em></h3>\n<p>I remember seeing a lot of positive things written about the previous Flying Lotus album—2008’s Los Angeles—but for whatever reason I never got around to picking it up. When <em>Cosmogramma</em> dropped in early summer I was sure to get in on the ground floor, and I discovered an album of dense, vital electronica brimming with energy and ideas.</p>\n<p>My touchstone for this genre remains Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet, and what Flying Lotus is doing here is a little messier and, I would guess, more aimed at the headphones than Kieran Hebden’s recent output, which has been more club-oriented.</p>\n<p>The Thom Yorke cameo on ‘…And the World Laughs with You’ is an easy highlight, but in some ways (e.g. it features vocals) it’s an outlier. This is a really interesting, layered record that I returned to a lot when zoning out during commutes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-four-tet--there-is-love-in-you\">17. Four Tet — <em>There is Love in You</em></h3>\n<p>My relationship with Four Tet is rooted in 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>, and it seems a long time since anything new has been released. That’s slightly misleading in that Kieran Hebden is a prolific remixer of everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Radiohead, and has, in the intervening five years, put out two EPs and two very strong albums of material with jazz drummer Steve Reid.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s nice to have a new, full-length release from Four Tet. I’ve played the 2008 EP <em>Ringer</em> quite a bit, but somehow it felt like something of a stop-gap, and this album shows why. Hebden has been hosting nights at Shoreditch’s Plastic People for a while now, and has talked in several interviews about how the experience has affected his music. What separates this album from its predecessors is that it was built to be played to a live audience whereas the previous LPs fall into what I would categorise as headphone listening. That’s not to say that they wouldn’t work the other way round, but the shift is noticeable here on tracks like ‘Sing’ which loops and swings with a very singular purpose. I would guess that I’ll return to <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> more, but this is still wonderful stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-loscil--endless-falls\">16. Loscil — <em>Endless Falls</em></h3>\n<p>This was a discovery via Bleep.com, which has been good to me over the last couple of years when it comes to electronic music. On the mental list of artists in this genre, which I keep arranged by pace and tone, Loscil sits towards the slower, calmer end of the spectrum and has served as perfect reading music, winding down music, and getting-started music in roughly equal measure.</p>\n<p>The album’s cover photograph of blurry street furniture seen through a rain-splashed window sets the mood quite well. The album starts with what feels like almost a full minute of rain noise (which I’ve always been a sucker for anyway) and the pace doesn’t pick up a whole lot from there. It’s hard to put on paper what works so well about the music here. It develops at a glacial pace and all exists within the same tonal colour pallet of greys and blues, but this is expertly and subtly constructed stuff with genuine weight behind it.</p>\n<p>Of the instrumental music I’ve played a lot this year <em>Endless Falls</em> has leant itself least to being used as background music. Something about its intricate shadows and textures insists upon attention and patience, which it rewards with great depth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-she--him--volume-two\">15. She &amp; Him — <em>Volume Two</em></h3>\n<p>Having this album sat next to Loscil highlights the absurdity of drawing comparisons between much of this year’s listening material. All I can say is that I listened to Volume Two a lot and, despite its seeming simplicity, it didn’t even begin to get old.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most apt adjective for this album is “charming”. The record is immensely and instantly likeable, thanks in part to Deschanel’s voice—which resembles a slightly softer Jenny Lewis—and also to the quirky, poppy arrangements of many of the songs. Sometimes it sounds like 1950s bubblegum (‘Gonna Get Along Without You Now’ could be a Chordettes cover), sometimes like the Beach Boys (‘Don’t Look Back’), but regardless the quality never lets up and it’s impossible not to be swept up in its enthusiasm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-joanna-newsom--have-one-on-me\">14. Joanna Newsom — <em>Have One on Me</em></h3>\n<p>Unique doesn’t begin to cover Joanna Newsom. Placing her in the folk category seems dismissive of her sound’s expansiveness and her penchant for theatricality. The lyrics are certainly folky in that they often convey stories woven out of pastoral themes, but (just as with Laura Marling) there’s a lot more going on here.</p>\n<p>On 2006’s <em>Ys</em>, Newsom really embraced the drama of her songwriting, bringing in Van Dyke Parks to add flourishes and even more colour to her songs. Arguably this led to the album feeling a little too dense and claustrophobic, an impression not helped by its composition: five tracks with an average length somewhere north of 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>By contrast, though it exhibits a markedly longer running time, <em>Have One On Me</em> seems less weighty, airier, possessed of more space and sunlight. Many songs are stripped back simply to Newsom’s voice and harp, which have always been the core of her art and have never been better than here. To a greater extent than any other record I listened to this year, Newsom’s album offers you a chance to put on headphones and drift away to a different place entirely. She remains quite unique.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-laura-marling--i-speak-because-i-can\">13. Laura Marling — <em>I Speak Because I Can</em></h3>\n<p>Laura Marling’s 2008 debut was that rare thing in the world of the modern music press: an unexpected delight; a surprise. That voice, the very English-ness of her sensibility, her ability to seem and sound simultaneous fragile and formidable. It was immediately clear that Marling was a prodigious talent and the purveyor of a quite unique sound, and that album was by far and away my favourite of the year.</p>\n<p>Since then it seems that a number of acts have attempted to peddle a faux-folksy kitsch in Marling’s wake, and it has more often than not rang a little false to my ears. Marling’s sincerity is palpable and her ability to tell a story in each beautiful song is unparalleled among her peers. <em>I Speak Because I Can</em> is a more assured album, and a mesmerising one. The swinging melody of ‘Alpha Shallows’, the heart-wrenching beauty of ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’, the barefoot do-si-do of album closer ‘Nature of Dust’… everything here is masterfully accomplished and infused with limitless warmth and charm. If it falls short of its predecessor it is perhaps only because it comes as no surprise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-olafur-arnalds--and-they-have-escaped-the-weight-of-darkness\">12. Olafur Arnalds — <em>…And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness</em></h3>\n<p>Arnalds is a 24 year-old Icelandic multi-instrumentalist making stunningly beautiful avant-garde orchestral electronica. This has been on rotation right alongside the Loscil album as perfect examples of simple music displaying almost limitless depths. Listened to on headphones it reveals itself to be utterly compelling and endlessly beautiful, as well as quite a draining listening experience. The way the simple melody of ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’ blossoms, for example is masterful, and the introduction of the cymbals at the three-minute mark is one of the most raw emotional moments I heard this year.</p>\n<p>The album’s tone shares some similarities with Arnalds’ more famous countrymen Sigur Rós, and the fact that he has duplicated their sheer expansiveness of sound, and retained their balance of complexity and simplicity whilst playing and constructing everything himself is, frankly, astounding.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-christian-scott--yesterday-you-said-tomorrow\">11. Christian Scott — <em>Yesterday You Said Tomorrow</em></h3>\n<p>When I started getting into hip-hop in the late ‘90s, I started digging for those “important” and “classic” LPs from a jumping off point of Run DMC, Public Enemy and R.A.T.M.’s <em>Renegades</em>. But I didn’t feel properly engaged in the genre until I stumbled across a contemporary artist who blew my mind: Buck 65’s <em>Square</em> (2002) completely changed my thinking about hip-hop and made the music feel really alive to me.</p>\n<p>So, when I started to get serious about jazz a few years back I tried from the outset to make it an equal part of my self-education in the genre to find contemporary artists. Jason Moran and Robert Glasper have both appeared on previous lists, but this year Christian Scott re-defined my ideas about what’s possible in jazz with this astounding record.</p>\n<p>Listening back through Scott’s catalogue this isn’t a fluke: both 2006’s <em>Rewind That</em> and the following year’s <em>Anthem</em> are enormously assured and overflowing with brilliance. One listen to the latter’s opener ‘Litany Against Fear’ is all the evidence required for jazz’s contemporary vitality.</p>\n<p><em>Yesterday…</em> however, is probably my favourite of the three, with album highlight, the achingly plaintive ‘Isadora’, standing as the most beautiful song I heard in 2010.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-keith-jarrett--charlie-haden--jasmine\">10. Keith Jarrett &amp; Charlie Haden — <em>Jasmine</em></h3>\n<p>Jarrett took 14th place on last year’s list with <em>Yesterdays</em>, a record I described at the time as “not my favourite Jarrett album”, and this year he takes 10th with absolutely my favourite of his recordings that I’ve heard.</p>\n<p>Jarrett’s collaboration with bassist Charlie Haden stretches back to 1967 and now numbers eight albums. Listening to <em>Jasmine</em> it’s easy to see why the two keep returning to this partnership. Jarrett’s playful, light piano swims effortlessly atop the subtle thrum of Haden’s double-bass undertow, knowing exactly when to allow the latter time to rise to the surface momentarily. The connection (as I said last year of Omar &amp; Cedric) must be near psychic to produce something so effortlessly unified. It’s a joy to listen to and endlessly relaxing.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-deftones--diamond-eyes\">9. Deftones — <em>Diamond Eyes</em></h3>\n<p>It’s fifteen years since I fell under Deftones’ spell with the visceral post-punk thunder-dirge of <em>Adrenaline</em>, and a decade since they hit their peak with the heavenly <em>White Pony</em>, which remains on my list should I have to pack five albums for a desert island.</p>\n<p>2005’s eponymous album, whilst still solid, felt a little lacking, but they really hit their stride again with 2006’s <em>Saturday Night Wrist</em>. And then the worst happened. During recording for what was to be a back-to-basics rock record titled <em>Eros</em>, bassist Chi Cheng was hit by a car. <em>Eros</em> was shelved indefinitely and it looked for a while like Deftones had come to an end.</p>\n<p>Cheng remains in a coma, and with <em>Diamond Eyes</em> his bandmates set out explicitly to make an album that would honour him. And what a fantastic tribute they have paid. By turns angry, beautiful, contemplative and celebratory this is their finest album in ten years and sounds not unlike <em>White Pony</em> in terms of breadth of tone and dusky, humid production style. Deftones remain a singular band, devoid of genre, possessed of limitless talent and still capable of surprising me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-broken-bells--broken-bells\">8. Broken Bells — <em>Broken Bells</em></h3>\n<p>I only really got into The Shins with 2007’s <em>Wincing the Night Away</em>, and it seems cruel to have made me wait so long for a follow-up to an album I enjoyed so much. With no sign of James Mercer getting back in the studio with the rest of his band, this will have to do for now, so it’s a good job it’s terrific.</p>\n<p>Mercer has a very expressive voice, which, alongside his brilliant lyrics, is my favourite aspect of The Shins. It’s just as well served here by Danger Mouse’s beats, which are more melodic than some of his work (e.g. with Jemini, or arguably Gnarls Barkley); it’s perhaps closer to his production of the Sparklehorse albums and Beck’s <em>Modern Guilt</em> a couple of years ago. The lyrics and vocal performance remain the highlight for me, but the dreamy bedding of ‘Your Head is on Fire’ or the hazy synth strings of ‘Citizen’ are what hold this odd, lovable album together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-vampire-weekend--contra\">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Contra</em></h3>\n<p>Where did Vampire Weekend come from? Who told them it was okay to make this twice-concentrated infectious indie-intellectual-pop with afro influences? After the 35 minutes of V.W.’s debut dominated my stereo almost exclusively for months, I remained unsure that a second album of the same kind of material would be as satisfying. What <em>Contra</em> proves is that this isn’t a gimmick, and that if you have it in you to produce more of this ultra-catchy pop music it should be mandatory that you do so.</p>\n<p>Vampire Weekend are doing many of the same things here as they seemingly invented on their debut, but the trick isn’t worn out, it’s just as energising and refreshing as first time around. Absolutely devoid of cynicism and full to the brim with enthusiasm for life and music, this is another summer album that has proven to be great listening throughout the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-surfer-blood--astro-coast\">6. Surfer Blood — <em>Astro Coast</em></h3>\n<p>It can’t be easy being an indie buzz band. For all of the hype-fed blog hysteria, there is (just as inevitably) the backlash. The hipsters have this down so well now that, to the average observer, the two seem almost simultaneous, leaving one unsure whether it’s cool to like Surfer Blood this week or not.</p>\n<p>But who cares when the music is this good? I’ll admit that, perhaps as a result of buying into some of that hype, the first time I heard <em>Astro Coast</em> I made unfriendly comparisons to Vampire Weekend. Unfriendly in that they were tainted with a pinch of copycat accusation, but the more I listened to the album the weaker that connection seemed, until I now almost can’t understand how I made it in the first place.</p>\n<p><em>Astro Coast</em> is a killer mix of debut album Weezer and <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Beach Boys, with a little So-Cal punk stirred in there for good measure. The result is sunny and infectious, and if there is a Vampire Weekend comparison it’s perhaps in the music seeming completely familiar very quickly. These songs feel as though you always knew them, and any time you play them it’s summer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-charlotte-gainsbourg--irm\">5. Charlotte Gainsbourg — <em>I.R.M.</em></h3>\n<p>I didn’t think much of Gainsbourg’s previous solo album, <em>5:55</em> (2006), but when I heard the single ‘Heaven Can Wait’ which preceded this album I knew I had to at least give the record a try. And it’s a revelation.</p>\n<p>The only explanation I can find for the chasm of difference in quality between the two albums is that Gainsbourg, like a crystal, seemingly absorbs the characteristics of those around her. <em>5:55</em> had Jarvis Cocker and Air all over it, and not enjoying the work of either of those artists I was put off by its euro-poppy production and coy foppishness.</p>\n<p><em>I.R.M.</em> is a different beast. It’s tonally a little darker and packed full of the kind of tunes that the first album was missing. Gainsbourg has a strong, melodic voice, and Beck (as producer here) knows just how to use it. In fact the album exhibits Beck’s influence in myriad interesting, non-obtrusive ways; so much so that it almost feels like a collaboration. It’s quirky and knowing and unafraid to explore itself, and as a result it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard in 2010.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-robyn--body-talk\">4. Robyn — <em>Body Talk</em></h3>\n<p>Full disclosure: Whiz has been into Robyn for some time, and if it wasn’t for her I don’t know how long it would have taken me to overcome my impression of Robyn (based on very little evidence) as just another dance starlet with little else to offer.</p>\n<p><em>Body Talk</em> was originally released as a set of three EPs throughout the year, but Robyn helped me out in terms of list-eligibility by collating them into a single release that stands as the most energetic and fun album to occupy my headphones all year. Full of colossal glowing synth, the kind of bass that pulls you in two directions at once and some deliciously funny and caustic lyricism, this is ridiculously catchy, grade-A, thoroughbred dance-pop.</p>\n<p>In a sea of indie and rock albums that come freighted with issues of credibility and hipness it was a pleasure to have something that did its job unquestionably by making me dance whilst I vacuumed, sing whilst I walked, and smile each and every time it came on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-buck-65--20-odd-years\">3. Buck 65 — <em>20 Odd Years</em></h3>\n<p>Much like Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em>, this was released as a series of four EPs throughout the year, but alas no collated album has been forthcoming. <em>20 Odd Years</em>, however, necessitates the bending of list eligibility rules as to omit it on the grounds that it was released in parts would be nothing short of a colossal tragedy (especially as a collected edition is forthcoming).</p>\n<p>The project marks the 20th year of Buck’s hip-hop career, and its material is suitably eclectic, taking in Buck’s various guises as romantic, goofball, virtuoso etc. etc. There’s very little Buck can’t do and do well, and the mix of styles here is somewhat dizzying. Replete with multiple guest vocalists and DJs this is a riotous celebration of a unique talent, never less than absolutely riveting and almost dangerously entertaining – just like the man himself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-my-chemical-romance--danger-days-the-true-lives-of-the-fabulous-killjoys\">2. My Chemical Romance — <em>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</em></h3>\n<p>It’s been a long, almost unbearable wait since 2006’s <em>The Black Parade</em>. Four years in which MCR have broken themselves down and built themselves back up again (less one member), taken off the black clothes and swapped them for the most colourful things they could find. And what of the music? <em>Danger Days</em> sounds very little like its predecessor. In places it resembles a neon-infused version of 2004’s <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em>; like that album the overarching concept has the protagonists on the run, and the music is infused with a dynamism arguably lacking from the majority of the more meditative <em>Black Parade</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the key to the differences between the albums is in the music out of which they are grown. If <em>The Black Parade</em> was a distorted gothic version of Queen, the soil in which <em>Danger Days</em> is planted is pure Springsteen-esque Americana as seen through a caffeinated hurricane of comic book images, muscle cars, and toy laser guns.</p>\n<p>Frank Iero has called the album “the soundtrack to raging against the death of the creative spark”, echoing Gerard Way’s concerns about what entering his 30s meant for his art. And this does sound like a band who feel as though they have something to prove. Unquestionably they succeed in doing so.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-arcade-fire--the-suburbs\">1. Arcade Fire — <em>The Suburbs</em></h3>\n<p>What’s the strongest run of three studio albums you can think of? <em>The Bends, OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em>? <em>Off the Wall, Thriller</em> and <em>Bad</em>? <em>Master of Puppets, …And Justice for All</em> and <em>Metallica</em>?</p>\n<p>Which band / artist has the best set of three studio albums to <em>start</em> their career? Nirvana? Björk? Deftones? Bloc Party? Foo Fighters?</p>\n<p>Arcade Fire are undoubtedly something special. In an era that has seen the decline of the physical format and where “shuffle” has become the predominant listening experience, they are a quintessential album band. They are forthright and outspoken in their political convictions; indefatigable in their touring schedule; meticulous in their standards of quality. In the 44 tracks that make up their three albums and one EP to date there is not one weak song.</p>\n<p><em>The Suburbs</em> is a remarkable achievement in and of itself: a beautiful, thoughtful record of songs full of longing and loss, love and loneliness and a pursuit of meaning. Its influences—as with the band’s previous albums—come from the middle of the North American radio dial, and no band is able to make that music seem so shiningly vital as Arcade Fire do on track after track.</p>\n<p>The most insightful commentary I’ve seen on the album reads it as part of a trilogy. The feeling of longing to leave home, which is present on <em>Funeral</em> (particularly the ‘Neighborhood’ tracks) is mirrored in the return here of an older and wiser narrative voice to the place of its youth. <em>Neon Bible</em>, which sits in the middle as the record of worldly experience is noticeably darker and more preoccupied with menacing themes. <em>The Suburbs</em> sounds more comfortable and reflective by comparison, but is just as emotionally wrought in its own way.</p>\n<p>It’s a stunning collection of songs, somehow living up to the astronomical expectations with which I awaited it; it also stands as further confirmation that Arcade Fire are the most consistently inspired and inspiring band recording today.

A lot of great music missed out on a coveted top 20 spot and it’s only right that I make room for a couple of honourable mentions:</p>\n<p>First and foremost, Glassjaw have been drip-feeding new material through one at a time YouTube videos and digital downloads and it’s mindblowing – a full album must follow in 2011 for the sake of my sanity.</p>\n<p>Liars’ <em>Sisterworld</em> should by all rights have made this list. Along with Battles, who sadly split with Tyondai Braxton this year; they’re one of the most consistently innovative bands on my radar.</p>\n<p>Polar Bear’s <em>Peepers</em> was another contemporary jazz find that got quite a lot of play – super funky and very playful.</p>\n<p><em>The Monitor</em> by Titus Andronicus missed out by virtue of being more admirable than enjoyable, but still certainly warrants a mention.</p>\n<p>As does Wolf Parade who, in <em>Expo 86</em>, made perhaps their most accessible LP to date.</p>\n<p>The return of Far was cause for much celebration by me, but in the end, despite having one of the year’s best opening tracks in ‘Deafening’, <em>At Night We Live</em> didn’t quite manage to live up to the expectation.</p>\n<p>Pure Reason Revolution’s <em>Hammer &amp; Anvil</em> somehow failed to grab me, perhaps because it came out relatively late in the year, and the same can be said for Warpaint’s debut <em>The Fool</em> and The Mynabirds’ <em>What We Lose in the Fire we Gain in the Flood</em>, both of which I only recently discovered and have been playing a lot – these may sneak onto The List if the year was a month longer.</p>\n<p>Even in the best of musical years there have to be a couple of disappointments and it feels worth noting a few here:</p>\n<p>The continued decline of Weezer is a source of great dismay, thrown into even greater contrast by bands like Surfer Blood making the sort of music Weezer used to be capable of.</p>\n<p>The M.I.A. record was a similar disappointment after much anticipation, and Jimmy Eat World turned in a pretty lackluster effort – outdone at their own game by The Posies.</p>\n<p>There were a number of interesting release strategies this year. As well as Robyn and Buck 65 choosing multiple EPs over the album format, there was Ash releasing one song every two weeks (the standard was pretty high too), Girl Talk and Gorillaz giving music away, and Smashing Pumpkins putting out a song every now and again from what Mr. Corgan promises will be a 44 track collection!</p>\n<p>Off the top of my head and resisting the urge to overthink, these are my songs of the year in no particular order:</p>\n<p>• Robyn ‘Fembot’<br>\n• My Chemical Romance ‘Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na)’<br>\n• Far ‘Deafening’<br>\n• Charlotte Gainsbourg ‘Heaven Can Wait’<br>\n• Laura Marling ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’<br>\n• Arcade Fire ‘City With No Children’<br>\n• The Mynabirds ‘What We Gained in the Fire’<br>\n• The Posies ‘For The Ashes’<br>\n• Christian Scott ‘Isadora’<br>\n• Deftones ‘Rocket Skates’<br>\n• Ólafur Arnalds ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’</p>\n<p>And looking forward to the new year the albums which immediately come to mind as my most anticipated are by Glassjaw, Cold War Kids, Radiohead, Silverchair, Metallica, The Decemberists, Foo Fighters (?), Laura Marling and Beastie Boys.</p>\n<p>Bring on 2011.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

OK Go — *Of the Blue Colour of the Sky*\n\nIt’s a great feeling to be surprised by an album, and even more special when it happens more than once within the same record. Even having heard very little of the previous material I thought I had OK Go pegged: another spiky pop band in the Tapes n’ Tapes, Hot Hot Heat mould but with more innovative promo videos. It turns out there’s a lot more to the Chicago four-piece than that. \n\nAs those self-made videos attest, this is a band bursting at the seams with ideas, and on this album they let rip with a multitude of styles, delivering dance-rock (‘This Too Shall Pass’), ballads (‘Skyscrapers’) and synth-pop (‘End Love’) among others. The album highlight is a toss-up between the shockingly on-the-money Prince tribute ‘White Knuckles’ and the surprisingly tender digital lament ‘Before the Earth was Round’. In some respects it’s shocking that those two songs exist on the same album. That OK Go attempt so much here and pull it off without a misstep is deserving of enormously impressive. \n\n\u000c\n###  19. The Posies — *Blood / Candy*\n\nAlong with Brad’s *Interiors* (1997) and Screaming Trees’ *Dust* (1996), I treasure The Posies’ 1993 album *Frosting on the Beater* for having shaped something special out of the beautiful, melodic aspects of grunge without having felt it necessary to pretend at angst. I dipped into some of the band’s other records but didn’t find anything as consistently engaging. Likewise with albums since; I listened to 2005’s *Every Kind of Light* a fair bit, but I honestly don’t remember whether it claimed a place on my year end List. \n\nHaving taken a bit of a break since then it seems that some of the old magic has been recaptured. *Blood / Candy* is a set of three and four-minute easygoing pop gems with just the right touch of melancholic edge to them. Opener ‘Plastic Paperbacks’ is expertly judged, and enough by itself to assure you that this is a band (having been recording since the late 80s) in full command of their talents. The subtle mood-swings of ‘Cleopatra Street’ are further proof that The Posies are capable of pretty much anything they turn their mind to, and the three and half minutes of ‘For The Ashes’ prove it, crafting something heartbreaking and huge-seeming out of very little. \n\n###  18. Flying Lotus — *Cosmogramma*\n\nI remember seeing a lot of positive things written about the previous Flying Lotus album—2008’s Los Angeles—but for whatever reason I never got around to picking it up. When *Cosmogramma* dropped in early summer I was sure to get in on the ground floor, and I discovered an album of dense, vital electronica brimming with energy and ideas. \n\nMy touchstone for this genre remains Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet, and what Flying Lotus is doing here is a little messier and, I would guess, more aimed at the headphones than Kieran Hebden’s recent output, which has been more club-oriented. \n\t\nThe Thom Yorke cameo on ‘…And the World Laughs with You’ is an easy highlight, but in some ways (e.g. it features vocals) it’s an outlier. This is a really interesting, layered record that I returned to a lot when zoning out during commutes. \n\n###  17. Four Tet — *There is Love in You*\n\nMy relationship with Four Tet is rooted in 2003’s *Rounds* and 2005’s *Everything Ecstatic*, and it seems a long time since anything new has been released. That’s slightly misleading in that Kieran Hebden is a prolific remixer of everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Radiohead, and has, in the intervening five years, put out two EPs and two very strong albums of material with jazz drummer Steve Reid. \n\t\nStill, it’s nice to have a new, full-length release from Four Tet. I’ve played the 2008 EP *Ringer* quite a bit, but somehow it felt like something of a stop-gap, and this album shows why. Hebden has been hosting nights at Shoreditch’s Plastic People for a while now, and has talked in several interviews about how the experience has affected his music. What separates this album from its predecessors is that it was built to be played to a live audience whereas the previous LPs fall into what I would categorise as headphone listening. That’s not to say that they wouldn’t work the other way round, but the shift is noticeable here on tracks like ‘Sing’ which loops and swings with a very singular purpose. I would guess that I’ll return to *Everything Ecstatic* more, but this is still wonderful stuff.  \n\n###  16. Loscil — *Endless Falls*\n\nThis was a discovery via Bleep.com, which has been good to me over the last couple of years when it comes to electronic music. On the mental list of artists in this genre, which I keep arranged by pace and tone, Loscil sits towards the slower, calmer end of the spectrum and has served as perfect reading music, winding down music, and getting-started music in roughly equal measure. \n\nThe album’s cover photograph of blurry street furniture seen through a rain-splashed window sets the mood quite well. The album starts with what feels like almost a full minute of rain noise (which I’ve always been a sucker for anyway) and the pace doesn’t pick up a whole lot from there. It’s hard to put on paper what works so well about the music here. It develops at a glacial pace and all exists within the same tonal colour pallet of greys and blues, but this is expertly and subtly constructed stuff with genuine weight behind it. \n\t\nOf the instrumental music I’ve played a lot this year *Endless Falls* has leant itself least to being used as background music. Something about its intricate shadows and textures insists upon attention and patience, which it rewards with great depth. \n\n###  15. She & Him — *Volume Two*\n\nHaving this album sat next to Loscil highlights the absurdity of drawing comparisons between much of this year’s listening material. All I can say is that I listened to Volume Two a lot and, despite its seeming simplicity, it didn’t even begin to get old. \n\t\nPerhaps the most apt adjective for this album is “charming”. The record is immensely and instantly likeable, thanks in part to Deschanel’s voice—which resembles a slightly softer Jenny Lewis—and also to the quirky, poppy arrangements of many of the songs. Sometimes it sounds like 1950s bubblegum (‘Gonna Get Along Without You Now’ could be a Chordettes cover), sometimes like the Beach Boys (‘Don’t Look Back’), but regardless the quality never lets up and it’s impossible not to be swept up in its enthusiasm. \n\n###  14. Joanna Newsom — *Have One on Me*\n\nUnique doesn’t begin to cover Joanna Newsom. Placing her in the folk category seems dismissive of her sound’s expansiveness and her penchant for theatricality. The lyrics are certainly folky in that they often convey stories woven out of pastoral themes, but (just as with Laura Marling) there’s a lot more going on here.\n\t\nOn 2006’s *Ys*, Newsom really embraced the drama of her songwriting, bringing in Van Dyke Parks to add flourishes and even more colour to her songs. Arguably this led to the album feeling a little too dense and claustrophobic, an impression not helped by its composition: five tracks with an average length somewhere north of 10 minutes. \n\t\nBy contrast, though it exhibits a markedly longer running time, *Have One On Me* seems less weighty, airier, possessed of more space and sunlight. Many songs are stripped back simply to Newsom’s voice and harp, which have always been the core of her art and have never been better than here. To a greater extent than any other record I listened to this year, Newsom’s album offers you a chance to put on headphones and drift away to a different place entirely. She remains quite unique. \n\n###  13. Laura Marling — *I Speak Because I Can*\n\nLaura Marling’s 2008 debut was that rare thing in the world of the modern music press: an unexpected delight; a surprise. That voice, the very English-ness of her sensibility, her ability to seem and sound simultaneous fragile and formidable. It was immediately clear that Marling was a prodigious talent and the purveyor of a quite unique sound, and that album was by far and away my favourite of the year. \n\t\nSince then it seems that a number of acts have attempted to peddle a faux-folksy kitsch in Marling’s wake, and it has more often than not rang a little false to my ears. Marling’s sincerity is palpable and her ability to tell a story in each beautiful song is unparalleled among her peers. *I Speak Because I Can* is a more assured album, and a mesmerising one. The swinging melody of ‘Alpha Shallows’, the heart-wrenching beauty of ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’, the barefoot do-si-do of album closer ‘Nature of Dust’… everything here is masterfully accomplished and infused with limitless warmth and charm. If it falls short of its predecessor it is perhaps only because it comes as no surprise. \n\n###  12. Olafur Arnalds — *…And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness*\n\nArnalds is a 24 year-old Icelandic multi-instrumentalist making stunningly beautiful avant-garde orchestral electronica. This has been on rotation right alongside the Loscil album as perfect examples of simple music displaying almost limitless depths. Listened to on headphones it reveals itself to be utterly compelling and endlessly beautiful, as well as quite a draining listening experience. The way the simple melody of ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’ blossoms, for example is masterful, and the introduction of the cymbals at the three-minute mark is one of the most raw emotional moments I heard this year.  \n\t\nThe album’s tone shares some similarities with Arnalds’ more famous countrymen Sigur Rós, and the fact that he has duplicated their sheer expansiveness of sound, and retained their balance of complexity and simplicity whilst playing and constructing everything himself is, frankly, astounding. \n\n\u000c\n###  11. Christian Scott — *Yesterday You Said Tomorrow*\n\nWhen I started getting into hip-hop in the late ‘90s, I started digging for those “important” and “classic” LPs from a jumping off point of Run DMC, Public Enemy and R.A.T.M.’s *Renegades*. But I didn’t feel properly engaged in the genre until I stumbled across a contemporary artist who blew my mind: Buck 65’s *Square* (2002) completely changed my thinking about hip-hop and made the music feel really alive to me. \n\nSo, when I started to get serious about jazz a few years back I tried from the outset to make it an equal part of my self-education in the genre to find contemporary artists. Jason Moran and Robert Glasper have both appeared on previous lists, but this year Christian Scott re-defined my ideas about what’s possible in jazz with this astounding record. \n\t\nListening back through Scott’s catalogue this isn’t a fluke: both 2006’s *Rewind That* and the following year’s *Anthem* are enormously assured and overflowing with brilliance. One listen to the latter’s opener ‘Litany Against Fear’ is all the evidence required for jazz’s contemporary vitality. \n\n*Yesterday…* however, is probably my favourite of the three, with album highlight, the achingly plaintive ‘Isadora’, standing as the most beautiful song I heard in 2010. \n\n###  10. Keith Jarrett & Charlie Haden — *Jasmine*\n\nJarrett took 14th place on last year’s list with *Yesterdays*, a record I described at the time as “not my favourite Jarrett album”, and this year he takes 10th with absolutely my favourite of his recordings that I’ve heard. \n\nJarrett’s collaboration with bassist Charlie Haden stretches back to 1967 and now numbers eight albums. Listening to *Jasmine* it’s easy to see why the two keep returning to this partnership. Jarrett’s playful, light piano swims effortlessly atop the subtle thrum of Haden’s double-bass undertow, knowing exactly when to allow the latter time to rise to the surface momentarily. The connection (as I said last year of Omar & Cedric) must be near psychic to produce something so effortlessly unified. It’s a joy to listen to and endlessly relaxing. \n\n\u000c\n###  9. Deftones — *Diamond Eyes*\n\nIt’s fifteen years since I fell under Deftones’ spell with the visceral post-punk thunder-dirge of *Adrenaline*, and a decade since they hit their peak with the heavenly *White Pony*, which remains on my list should I have to pack five albums for a desert island. \n\t\n2005’s eponymous album, whilst still solid, felt a little lacking, but they really hit their stride again with 2006’s *Saturday Night Wrist*. And then the worst happened. During recording for what was to be a back-to-basics rock record titled *Eros*, bassist Chi Cheng was hit by a car. *Eros* was shelved indefinitely and it looked for a while like Deftones had come to an end. \n\t\nCheng remains in a coma, and with *Diamond Eyes* his bandmates set out explicitly to make an album that would honour him. And what a fantastic tribute they have paid. By turns angry, beautiful, contemplative and celebratory this is their finest album in ten years and sounds not unlike *White Pony* in terms of breadth of tone and dusky, humid production style. Deftones remain a singular band, devoid of genre, possessed of limitless talent and still capable of surprising me.\n\n###  8. Broken Bells — *Broken Bells* \n\nI only really got into The Shins with 2007’s *Wincing the Night Away*, and it seems cruel to have made me wait so long for a follow-up to an album I enjoyed so much. With no sign of James Mercer getting back in the studio with the rest of his band, this will have to do for now, so it’s a good job it’s terrific. \n\t\nMercer has a very expressive voice, which, alongside his brilliant lyrics, is my favourite aspect of The Shins. It’s just as well served here by Danger Mouse’s beats, which are more melodic than some of his work (e.g. with Jemini, or arguably Gnarls Barkley); it’s perhaps closer to his production of the Sparklehorse albums and Beck’s *Modern Guilt* a couple of years ago. The lyrics and vocal performance remain the highlight for me, but the dreamy bedding of ‘Your Head is on Fire’ or the hazy synth strings of ‘Citizen’ are what hold this odd, lovable album together.\n\n###  7. Vampire Weekend — *Contra*\n\nWhere did Vampire Weekend come from? Who told them it was okay to make this twice-concentrated infectious indie-intellectual-pop with afro influences? After the 35 minutes of V.W.’s debut dominated my stereo almost exclusively for months, I remained unsure that a second album of the same kind of material would be as satisfying. What *Contra* proves is that this isn’t a gimmick, and that if you have it in you to produce more of this ultra-catchy pop music it should be mandatory that you do so. \n\t\nVampire Weekend are doing many of the same things here as they seemingly invented on their debut, but the trick isn’t worn out, it’s just as energising and refreshing as first time around. Absolutely devoid of cynicism and full to the brim with enthusiasm for life and music, this is another summer album that has proven to be great listening throughout the year. \n\n###  6. Surfer Blood — *Astro Coast*\n\nIt can’t be easy being an indie buzz band. For all of the hype-fed blog hysteria, there is (just as inevitably) the backlash. The hipsters have this down so well now that, to the average observer, the two seem almost simultaneous, leaving one unsure whether it’s cool to like Surfer Blood this week or not. \n\nBut who cares when the music is this good? I’ll admit that, perhaps as a result of buying into some of that hype, the first time I heard *Astro Coast* I made unfriendly comparisons to Vampire Weekend. Unfriendly in that they were tainted with a pinch of copycat accusation, but the more I listened to the album the weaker that connection seemed, until I now almost can’t understand how I made it in the first place. \n\t\n*Astro Coast* is a killer mix of debut album Weezer and *Pet Sounds*-era Beach Boys, with a little So-Cal punk stirred in there for good measure. The result is sunny and infectious, and if there is a Vampire Weekend comparison it’s perhaps in the music seeming completely familiar very quickly. These songs feel as though you always knew them, and any time you play them it’s summer. \n\n###  5. Charlotte Gainsbourg — *I.R.M.*\n\nI didn’t think much of Gainsbourg’s previous solo album, *5:55* (2006), but when I heard the single ‘Heaven Can Wait’ which preceded this album I knew I had to at least give the record a try. And it’s a revelation. \n\t\nThe only explanation I can find for the chasm of difference in quality between the two albums is that Gainsbourg, like a crystal, seemingly absorbs the characteristics of those around her. *5:55* had Jarvis Cocker and Air all over it, and not enjoying the work of either of those artists I was put off by its euro-poppy production and coy foppishness. \n\t\n*I.R.M.* is a different beast. It’s tonally a little darker and packed full of the kind of tunes that the first album was missing. Gainsbourg has a strong, melodic voice, and Beck (as producer here) knows just how to use it. In fact the album exhibits Beck’s influence in myriad interesting, non-obtrusive ways; so much so that it almost feels like a collaboration. It’s quirky and knowing and unafraid to explore itself, and as a result it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard in 2010.\n\n###  4. Robyn — *Body Talk*\n\nFull disclosure: Whiz has been into Robyn for some time, and if it wasn’t for her I don’t know how long it would have taken me to overcome my impression of Robyn (based on very little evidence) as just another dance starlet with little else to offer.\n\n*Body Talk* was originally released as a set of three EPs throughout the year, but Robyn helped me out in terms of list-eligibility by collating them into a single release that stands as the most energetic and fun album to occupy my headphones all year. Full of colossal glowing synth, the kind of bass that pulls you in two directions at once and some deliciously funny and caustic lyricism, this is ridiculously catchy, grade-A, thoroughbred dance-pop. \n\nIn a sea of indie and rock albums that come freighted with issues of credibility and hipness it was a pleasure to have something that did its job unquestionably by making me dance whilst I vacuumed, sing whilst I walked, and smile each and every time it came on. \n\n###  3. Buck 65 — *20 Odd Years*\n\nMuch like Robyn’s *Body Talk*, this was released as a series of four EPs throughout the year, but alas no collated album has been forthcoming. *20 Odd Years*, however, necessitates the bending of list eligibility rules as to omit it on the grounds that it was released in parts would be nothing short of a colossal tragedy (especially as a collected edition is forthcoming). \n\nThe project marks the 20th year of Buck’s hip-hop career, and its material is suitably eclectic, taking in Buck’s various guises as romantic, goofball, virtuoso etc. etc. There’s very little Buck can’t do and do well, and the mix of styles here is somewhat dizzying. Replete with multiple guest vocalists and DJs this is a riotous celebration of a unique talent, never less than absolutely riveting and almost dangerously entertaining – just like the man himself. \n\n###  2. My Chemical Romance — *Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys*\n\nIt’s been a long, almost unbearable wait since 2006’s *The Black Parade*. Four years in which MCR have broken themselves down and built themselves back up again (less one member), taken off the black clothes and swapped them for the most colourful things they could find. And what of the music? *Danger Days* sounds very little like its predecessor. In places it resembles a neon-infused version of 2004’s *Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge*; like that album the overarching concept has the protagonists on the run, and the music is infused with a dynamism arguably lacking from the majority of the more meditative *Black Parade*.\n \nPerhaps the key to the differences between the albums is in the music out of which they are grown. If *The Black Parade* was a distorted gothic version of Queen, the soil in which *Danger Days* is planted is pure Springsteen-esque Americana as seen through a caffeinated hurricane of comic book images, muscle cars, and toy laser guns. \n\t\nFrank Iero has called the album “the soundtrack to raging against the death of the creative spark”, echoing Gerard Way’s concerns about what entering his 30s meant for his art. And this does sound like a band who feel as though they have something to prove. Unquestionably they succeed in doing so. \n\n###  1. Arcade Fire — *The Suburbs*\n\nWhat’s the strongest run of three studio albums you can think of? *The Bends, OK Computer* and *Kid A*? *Off the Wall, Thriller* and *Bad*? *Master of Puppets, …And Justice for All* and *Metallica*? \n\nWhich band / artist has the best set of three studio albums to *start* their career? Nirvana? Björk? Deftones? Bloc Party? Foo Fighters?\n\nArcade Fire are undoubtedly something special. In an era that has seen the decline of the physical format and where “shuffle” has become the predominant listening experience, they are a quintessential album band. They are forthright and outspoken in their political convictions; indefatigable in their touring schedule; meticulous in their standards of quality. In the 44 tracks that make up their three albums and one EP to date there is not one weak song. \n\t\n*The Suburbs* is a remarkable achievement in and of itself: a beautiful, thoughtful record of songs full of longing and loss, love and loneliness and a pursuit of meaning. Its influences—as with the band’s previous albums—come from the middle of the North American radio dial, and no band is able to make that music seem so shiningly vital as Arcade Fire do on track after track. \n\nThe most insightful commentary I’ve seen on the album reads it as part of a trilogy. The feeling of longing to leave home, which is present on *Funeral* (particularly the ‘Neighborhood’ tracks) is mirrored in the return here of an older and wiser narrative voice to the place of its youth. *Neon Bible*, which sits in the middle as the record of worldly experience is noticeably darker and more preoccupied with menacing themes. *The Suburbs* sounds more comfortable and reflective by comparison, but is just as emotionally wrought in its own way. \n\t\nIt’s a stunning collection of songs, somehow living up to the astronomical expectations with which I awaited it; it also stands as further confirmation that Arcade Fire are the most consistently inspired and inspiring band recording today. Thom, Jonny *et al*: the ball is in your court.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\n###  Appendices \n\nPutting this thing together was harder this year than maybe any year I can remember. A lot of great music missed out on a coveted top 20 spot and it’s only right that I make room for a couple of honourable mentions:\n\nFirst and foremost, Glassjaw have been drip-feeding new material through one at a time YouTube videos and digital downloads and it’s mindblowing – a full album must follow in 2011 for the sake of my sanity.\n\nLiars’ *Sisterworld* should by all rights have made this list. Along with Battles, who sadly split with Tyondai Braxton this year; they’re one of the most consistently innovative bands on my radar. \n\nPolar Bear’s *Peepers* was another contemporary jazz find that got quite a lot of play – super funky and very playful. \n\n*The Monitor* by Titus Andronicus missed out by virtue of being more admirable than enjoyable, but still certainly warrants a mention. \n\nAs does Wolf Parade who, in *Expo 86*, made perhaps their most accessible LP to date. \n\nThe return of Far was cause for much celebration by me, but in the end, despite having one of the year’s best opening tracks in ‘Deafening’, *At Night We Live* didn’t quite manage to live up to the expectation.\n\nPure Reason Revolution’s *Hammer & Anvil* somehow failed to grab me, perhaps because it came out relatively late in the year, and the same can be said for Warpaint’s debut *The Fool* and The Mynabirds’ *What We Lose in the Fire we Gain in the Flood*, both of which I only recently discovered and have been playing a lot – these may sneak onto The List if the year was a month longer. \n\nEven in the best of musical years there have to be a couple of disappointments and it feels worth noting a few here: \n\nThe continued decline of Weezer is a source of great dismay, thrown into even greater contrast by bands like Surfer Blood making the sort of music Weezer used to be capable of. \n\nThe M.I.A. record was a similar disappointment after much anticipation, and Jimmy Eat World turned in a pretty lackluster effort – outdone at their own game by The Posies.\n\t\nThere were a number of interesting release strategies this year. As well as Robyn and Buck 65 choosing multiple EPs over the album format, there was Ash releasing one song every two weeks (the standard was pretty high too), Girl Talk and Gorillaz giving music away, and Smashing Pumpkins putting out a song every now and again from what Mr. Corgan promises will be a 44 track collection! \n\nOff the top of my head and resisting the urge to overthink, these are my songs of the year in no particular order:\n\n• Robyn ‘Fembot’  \n• My Chemical Romance ‘Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na)’  \n• Far ‘Deafening’  \n• Charlotte Gainsbourg ‘Heaven Can Wait’  \n• Laura Marling ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’  \n• Arcade Fire ‘City With No Children’  \n• The Mynabirds ‘What We Gained in the Fire’  \n• The Posies ‘For The Ashes’  \n• Christian Scott ‘Isadora’  \n• Deftones ‘Rocket Skates’  \n• Ólafur Arnalds ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’  \n\nAnd looking forward to the new year the albums which immediately come to mind as my most anticipated are by Glassjaw, Cold War Kids, Radiohead, Silverchair, Metallica, The Decemberists, Foo Fighters (?), Laura Marling and Beastie Boys. \n\nBring on 2011.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

It&rsquo;s a humble genesis, and the movie it produced, whilst still thoroughly entertaining, hasn&rsquo;t aged well. Viewing it now for the first time, without the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia, it must be difficult to understand why it is so beloved, and why it was hailed as such a revolutionary method of film-making. Reading accounts of the film&rsquo;s production (such as the one in the Nov / Dec 2010 issue of <em>Little White Lies</em>, or the excellent article in the January 2011 issue of <em>Empire</em>) I was reminded of nothing more than of those reports from the &lsquo;set&rsquo; of <em>Avatar</em>: all those effusive remarks about what the advent of a purely virtual shooting environment would mean for the future of cinema; how it was now possible to create something almost entirely in post-production.</p>\n<p>The original <em>Tron</em> is a romp. Its pace is surprisingly slow, but not because the characters stop to ponder the philosophical meaning behind their circumstances, just because that&rsquo;s the pace of a family adventure story shot in the &rsquo;80s without the crutch of C.G. to up its whizzbang quota. Joseph Kosinski&rsquo;s sequel is a different story. Wasting no time in getting his protagonist zapped out of the physical world and into the virtual one, the pace rarely lets up once Sam Flynn is neon-suited and thrown straight out onto the game grid having been told merely to &ldquo;survive&rdquo;. From here it&rsquo;s virtually all chase and pursuit, with a few martial arts brawls, lightcycle battles, and dogfights thrown in to keep the Daft Punk soundtrack busy.</p>\n<p>But there are a couple of pauses, and it&rsquo;s in the pauses that <em>Tron: Legacy</em> really gets interesting. The film complicates the hero / villain dynamic by having both characters played by one man, albeit two versions of one man at two different ages. And despite all of the attention (deservedly) being paid to the technical process which allows the younger Jeff Bridges to appear in the film, it is the fact of the characters' homogeneity within the story that is more interesting. Clu, though his actions are villainous, is in fact motivated purely by his creator&rsquo;s original instruction: to make &ldquo;a perfect system&rdquo;. To do so he instills order at any cost and eradicates imperfection wherever he finds it. His creator, having been trapped within Clu&rsquo;s dystopian creation for centuries, has spent his time meditating, reading, and seeking to cultivate within himself and his pupil Quorra, a selfless acceptance, tranquility, and stillness.</p>\n<p>One particularly telling line comes when Sam remarks to his father that the Grid must have been beautiful before Clu ruined it, and the older Flynn replies that &ldquo;Clu is me; I ruined it&rdquo;. Kevin Flynn is a wiser man than Clu precisely because he is a wiser man than when he made Clu in his own image. <em>Tron: Legacy</em> is a story about a man maturing, and learning to accept that his idea of perfection was flawed. Clu, as the unbounded version of Flynn&rsquo;s younger self, presides over a nightmarish dictatorship of virtual clones. The older Flynn has learned that the world is far wider than his experience, and that his concept of perfection is — ironically — flawed.

People thought those colors were mixed up, and I had to reinforce to management that that’s what I wanted.\n\nThose four symbols have become powerfully intertwined with the idea of videogames in a way which lettered buttons never could. It was a stroke of genius on Goto’s part to implement them, and they have understandably become the central aspect of the PlayStation brand. Perhaps with PlayStation 4 Sony will design a machine that matches their simplicity and elegance.\n",

				"title": "Tao Lin — Richard Yates (2010)",
				"content_html": "<p>Tao Lin’s new novel <em>Richard Yates</em> is by turns frustratingly literal, genuinely insightful, monotonous, charming, plain-faced and sweet. At a little over 200 pages it really only allows room for two characters: Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning (with the latter’s mother occasionally appearing at the periphery), and concerns itself equally with the minutiae of their days and the complexities of their relationship.</p>\n<p>Appropriating the names of child actors is just one of many layers of non sequitur Lin employs, arguably starting with the novel’s title. Yates’ work is mentioned on occasion, and it is arguable that Lin is concerned here with some themes similar to those found in the late writer’s stories; just as likely however is that the title and character names, like the cover image, were chosen to exacerbate that feeling of disconnection from which Lin’s characters suffer and with which Lin’s readers are inculcated to empathise. The connections between things here are uncertain, the gravity of cause and effect feels loosened somehow so that the reader feels simultaneously as though floating, ungrounded in the world of Lin’s creation, and swept on by its rhythm and momentum.</p>\n<p>The novel is not without plot, and indeed it is a great deal more concrete than the plots found in some of the author’s previous work. Stylistically <em>Richard Yates</em> bears more resemblance to Lin’s 2009 novella <em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em> than it does to his previous novel, <em>Eeeee Eee Eeee</em> (2007). In an interview with Brandon Tietz, Lin explains his effort towards a more “concrete / literal prose style” for <em>Richard Yates</em>. He gives examples of how a sentence might have appeared differently from one novel to the next:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Mike got out of the car” in [<em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em>] would be “Mike left the car” in [<em>Richard Yates</em>] due to “got out” not being literal and being more words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a page from an earlier draft of the novel in which you can see Lin in the process of making these alterations. In the margin he notes that a sentence could be more economically conveyed as dialogue, or strikes through extraneous reportage and notes &ldquo;Boring&rdquo;. These slight differences fit with the overall trend away from magical surrealism in Lin’s work over the last couple of years, but <em>Richard Yates</em> still retains moments of Coen-esque unreality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My brother emailed me,” said Haley Joel Osment. “He wants to pay me money to live in Connecticut for two weeks to potty train his and his girlfriend’s French bulldog Babo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like much of the novel it would be wrong to read the above with what Lin would call a “neutral facial expression” and yet it’s couched within the context of quite a tense exchange, and is followed, five lines later, by a threat of suicide. Also in the aforementioned interview Lin says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My books that don’t have concretely surreal elements usually feel surreal to me in tone. Real life often seems “dreamlike” to me. I like viewing real life as a dream. I like writing about it as if it were a dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lin’s detractors often criticise his one-note narrative style and his monotonous pacing, but these stylistic elements are also enormously challenging for the reader, who finds themself without the usual crutch of the author indicating to them how to feel. Lin’s style is artfully and meticulously constructed from elements of realism, minimalism, and reportage; seeming to give equal weight to wildly disparate narrative strands it asks the reader to assess relative importance for himself. This is made no easier by the fact that there are a number of fascinating dualities at the heart of Lin’s style: concrete v surrealist; surface detail v interiority; the specific v the vague. Whilst one might consider an economy of words to be one hallmark of Lin’s style, he is also fond of functionless detail, repetition and, in <em>Richard Yates</em>, unfailing use of the characters’ full names. Where he is generous with description it is most often on the level of volume rather than depth: details take precedence over insight, the reader again left to fend for themselves in parsing them. Which isn’t to say that there is objective, capital-M “Meaning” to be found. In a 2007 email to Gawker, Lin writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though all meaning is arbitrary it can still be used as a tool just like arbitrary rules can be created to make life “better.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This feels demonstrably true in Lin’s fiction. Nothing is given the weight one might expect an author to lend the “message” of his work – you might argue <em>Richard Yates</em> is a novel about loneliness, about discordance in relationships, about forms of communication and miscommunication, about any number of things. If you can resist the temptation to seek meaning however, there is enough enjoyment to be had in getting lost in the novel’s rich seam of detail and gathered up by the tempo of Lin’s prose.</p>\n<p>In his ‘Ugly Fish Poem’ (from the 2008 collection <em>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</em>) Lin writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i have wilfully and simultaneously subjected myself to multiple irreconcilable philosophies</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that, by treating all things equally in terms of prose tone, Lin allows for the possibility that all things are of equal importance. It is an interesting exercise to approach his novel with this philosophy in mind, and to find that a catalog of petty shoplifting, instant messenger conversations and relationship strife is perfectly capable of subtlety, nuance and indirectly expressed depths of feeling.</p>\n",

				"title": "In Response to Nicholson Baker on Video Games",
				"content_html": "<p>Nicholson Baker is one of my favourite novelists: witty, observant and capable of conjuring magic out of any overlooked facet of life that he turns his attention to. Baker’s piece on videogames in this week’s <em>New Yorker</em> (abstracted <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/09/100809fa_fact_baker\">here</a>) is characteristically insightful and treats the subject with a light touch, but reading it I felt the swell of defensiveness which rises in any hobbyist when their pastime comes under scrutiny by an outsider: Baker was missing the point. Baker’s report from the front line of gaming exposes the running themes of killing and dying in a manner which makes the gamer in me faintly ashamed. Judged like for like it’s hard to argue against the prevalence of death in gaming even over and above its centrality in cinema; even Sylvester Stallone’s back catalogue contains a body count which would appear meagre when put next to 90 accumulated hours of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> multiplayer. In large part I think this is due to an integral aspect of games with which no other media needs concern itself: challenge.</p>\n<p>There is &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; music, there are difficult films, and there are certainly difficult books, but their difficulties are qualitatively different to that of games. When watching a film or reading a book the level of perceived difficulty is no barrier to continuation. The experience may seem less enjoyable or less rewarding, but you can still turn the pages, the DVD doesn’t start skipping if you lose track of the plot. Even in the case of solo play, games are a conversation happening in real time: a push and pull between the gamer and the game’s AI.</p>\n<p>Gaming is, in large part, about challenge, and if you’re unable to meet the requirements for success you cannot continue. Baker notes the length of games, the 30+ hours put into making your way through an interactive narrative, and all of that time is accrued in overcoming obstacles. It just so happens that survival is a wonderfully clear-cut challenge, and character death the simplest way both to communicate to a player that their skills need work and to increase the game’s longevity. Thirty years since Atari’s <em>Asteroids</em> posed the challenge of keeping a little triangle in one piece by avoiding and destroying crude wire-frame rocks; thirty years also since players struggled to guide <em>Pac-Man</em> around mazes in search of power pellets, which would allow him to destroy ghosts before they could destroy him, game designers are yet to find a challenge as inspiring as avoiding death, or a thrill as basic as being the one to mete it out first. As the industry has grown and visual fidelity has increased exponentially the depiction of violence has undoubtedly grown more vivid and gratuitous, but death itself is part of some games for good reason.</p>\n<p>Gaming of course, is a broad church. Uncountable games in a plethora of genres offer an experience entirely free of the obligation to kill or the fear of dying. Puzzle games, including the perennially popular <em>Tetris</em> (possibly gaming’s greatest success story to date) pose a challenge of an entirely different kind. Photo hunts, role playing games, management simulations (including wildly popular Facebook games like <em>Farmville</em>), sports simulations, platformers&hellip; all shift the balance away from the kill or be killed dynamic. And that is perhaps the shame of Baker’s piece; guided by his 16 year old son into playing only the biggest selling triple-A titles of the last year or so Baker has missed a great swathe of what games are capable of. It’s roughly analogous to watching <em>Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Twilight: Eclipse</em>, and considering that a representative sample of modern cinema. The shame is less that Baker falls into this trap — he is quite clear that his investigation is of his son’s gaming habits — but that it robs us of his thoughts on other games in which he might find more to like. An article in which Nicholson Baker plays through Jason Rohrer’s interactive memento mori <em>Passage</em>, or gets involved on either side of the story-telling game <em>Sleep Is Death</em> would be fascinating. Personally I would love to know Baker’s impression of Molleindustria’s <em>Every Day The Same Dream</em> or Amanita Design’s charming <em>Machinarium</em>.</p>\n<p>All of this isn’t to decry Baker’s article. In it, and in the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/out-loud/nicholson-baker-examines-video-games\">podcast</a>, he is receptive to the idea of games as an art-form and is positively effusive about the beauty to be found in some of the constructed worlds with which he interacted. He praises the designers’ desire to “pay homage” to the real world - but that cannot be a game designer’s only goal, she must also busy herself with the effort to provide the player with an entertaining struggle. Part of loving an art form, and perhaps especially one still in its infancy, is wanting it to be viewed in a positive light. Baker does a wonderful job of appreciating detail in the games he played, but seems quick to write off their core as facile, trivial and blood-soaked. He may be right. In many ways gaming is going through an adolescence, with the first generation to have grown up playing games all of their lives now moving into positions of power within the industry. In time perhaps the predisposition towards violence will drop away and more nuanced stories can be told. Arguably this is beginning to happen already, and as it does hopefully more commentators of Baker’s calibre will discover that instead of merely base and bloodthirsty and brutal, games can be engaging and subtle and beautiful.</p>\n",

				"title": "Exposed @ Tate Modern",
				"content_html": "<p>Looking down from Tate Modern’s first floor balcony you can see the scar left by Doris Salcedo’s 2007 exhibit <em>Shibboleth</em>, a lightning strike of new concrete which runs the length of the vast Turbine Hall. Perched up here you could happily spend a great deal of time watching people coming in from the rain and negotiating the hall’s gentle slope. Though currently empty the room still has the power to elicit a response. Children run and skip when they get through the doors, people are sat against walls eating their lunch, and here and there bodies are sprawled on the floor as people stare up at the steel-girder ceiling. This is part of what Tate Modern has brought to London in the ten years since it opened: an inviting public space in which to encounter visual art, and the idea that art-appreciation shouldn’t be solely the province of small, intimidating, elitist galleries. As one of 5 million visitors per year you are afforded both the chance to view some spectacular modern art, and the chance to observe other people doing the same.</p>\n<p>The latest exhibition to take up residence on Tate Modern’s fourth floor, <em>Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance &amp; the Camera</em>, combines these ideas of art and people-watching, and challenges us to reconsider where the boundaries might lie. Over five thematic sections through more than a dozen rooms the visitor is presented with images which raise questions of intent, privacy, security and eroticism.</p>\n<p>Entering the first room of the exhibition you’re met with enlargements of shots from Philip-Lorca diCorcia’s series <em>Heads</em>. The images were taken from a great distance when pedestrians in New York unwittingly tripped automatic lights diCorcia rigged on the sidewalk. The text accompanying the photos tells you that one of the artist’s subjects took legal action against him, with the court eventually ruling in diCorcia’s favour. By choosing to present this material first it feels like the exhibition’s curators are tipping their hand in the voyeurism vs art debate that plays out over the following rooms. In the rest of the ‘Unseen Photographer’ section we’re shown images taken through buttonhole cameras (neatly presented in circular frames) and one-way mirrors, and introduced to the technology of the ‘lateral viewfinder’, positioned at a right angle to the camera’s true lens to allow for surreptitious ‘sideways’ photography.</p>\n<p>By sequencing ‘Celebrity &amp; the Public Gaze’ as the next section the visitor is asked to consider whether the rules are - or should be - different for the famous. The curators have performed a careful balancing act, leaving the question open for the visitor. On one wall there are several of Ron Galella’s photos of Jackie Kennedy, one (&lsquo;What makes Jackie Run&rsquo;) in which she is actively fleeing the photographer. On an adjoining wall Marilyn Monroe’s dress billows as she poses atop an air vent. The fact of the subjects’ celebrity brings a unique push and pull to the relationship between photographer and photographed and challenges us to separate public and private personae. The vibrant candid shot of Jack Nicholson which dominates one wall shows him swinging a golf club at the car of a driver who had just cut him up. There is a strange ‘in-character’ element to the image and it takes effort to see it as something other than a movie screenshot.</p>\n<p>The next two sections are the exhibition’s most challenging, and form a duologue of two big themes: sex &amp; death. It’s not so much the explicit nature of the images within ‘Voyeurism &amp; Desire’ that sets you on edge, as much as the element of illicitness in their having been taken and now in their being displayed. I felt acutely aware of the people around me through these rooms, and watching others’ efforts to appear to be appreciating this art in an acceptable manner added an enjoyable meta-level to the exhibition’s central themes. This section also contained some of the most striking images, and two exceptional pieces of hanging: selections from Merry Alpern’s <em>Dirty Windows</em> series presented in four rows and three columns evoking a grid of windows in a tower block; and the frankly creepy shots from Kohei Yoshiyuki’s 1971 infrared series <em>The Park</em> individually illuminated by spotlights in a darkened corridor.</p>\n<p>‘Witnessing Violence’ develops another human preoccupation in similarly captivating fashion. In amongst the obligatory stills from the Zapruder film Oliver Lutz has found a way to place the observer within the image. A large black canvas hangs alone on one wall, its image only revealed when the viewer looks at a monitor positioned nearby so as to frame them directly in front of the picture. The technique, which involves covering the photograph in infrared sensitive pigment is perhaps a little gimmicky but nevertheless impactful as another way of making the visitor reassess their relationship with the images on display.</p>\n<p>The final section, &lsquo;Surveillance&rsquo;, is perhaps the weakest. The divide between viewer and subject is increased, the images are often of lesser resolution and there is a detectable lack of human engagement in their making. These are largely pictures taken automatically, or single frames from an automated recording; simply in terms of composition, colouration and focus you can tell that there is not a human interest overseeing their manufacture. As a result I felt detachment from these last photographs where the majority of what had preceded had engaged me.</p>\n<p>Throughout the exhibition I sensed a lack of interest in narrative. The images on display were taken quickly or secretly or both, with the aim being to capture a single, true moment. The act of doing this removes that moment from its context and allows the viewer to wrap their own story around it. Every invasion of privacy with which we are confronted is simultaneously an invasion of our privacy and our invasion of someone else’s. Each image of violence invites us to imagine ourselves as victim, perpetrator and onlooker. In some cases, where a set of photos from the same series is presented, a story does begin to take shape - such as that in Enrique Metrinides’ &lsquo;Suicide Rescue from the Top of the Toreo Stadium&rsquo; - but even in these instances the narrative is abstract and incomplete. In this sense the exhibition demands every bit as much work on the part of the viewer as some of the ‘difficult’ abstract and impressionist work in the Tate’s permanent collection. For those interested in how the camera has changed our relationship to the world and each other, it is just as richly rewarding.</p>\n",

In amongst the obligatory stills from the Zapruder film Oliver Lutz has found a way to place the observer within the image. A large black canvas hangs alone on one wall, its image only revealed when the viewer looks at a monitor positioned nearby so as to frame them directly in front of the picture. The technique, which involves covering the photograph in infrared sensitive pigment is perhaps a little gimmicky but nevertheless impactful as another way of making the visitor reassess their relationship with the images on display. \n\nThe final section, 'Surveillance', is perhaps the weakest. The divide between viewer and subject is increased, the images are often of lesser resolution and there is a detectable lack of human engagement in their making. These are largely pictures taken automatically, or single frames from an automated recording; simply in terms of composition, colouration and focus you can tell that there is not a human interest overseeing their manufacture. As a result I felt detachment from these last photographs where the majority of what had preceded had engaged me. \n\nThroughout the exhibition I sensed a lack of interest in narrative. The images on display were taken quickly or secretly or both, with the aim being to capture a single, true moment. The act of doing this removes that moment from its context and allows the viewer to wrap their own story around it. Every invasion of privacy with which we are confronted is simultaneously an invasion of our privacy and our invasion of someone else’s. Each image of violence invites us to imagine ourselves as victim, perpetrator and onlooker. In some cases, where a set of photos from the same series is presented, a story does begin to take shape - such as that in Enrique Metrinides’ 'Suicide Rescue from the Top of the Toreo Stadium' - but even in these instances the narrative is abstract and incomplete. In this sense the exhibition demands every bit as much work on the part of the viewer as some of the ‘difficult’ abstract and impressionist work in the Tate’s permanent collection. For those interested in how the camera has changed our relationship to the world and each other, it is just as richly rewarding.\n",

I’m the one who makes little noises of disapproval because you have tracks just listed as ‘Track 1’, and some of your albums are missing artwork.

These are rules I’ve developed over the course of years using the program to organise my digital music. Sometimes I’ll come up with a rule, or Apple will change the software to make something new possible, and I will have to spend <em>literally hours</em> making sure the change is applied uniformly to my entire library.

Anything that’s dealt with I archive, anything that needs to be dealt with by me I keep in the inbox, and anything I’m waiting to hear back on I add a star to and archive. Then there are labels - the big difference between Gmail and its competitors (including Hotmail, from which I switched) was labelling emails instead of placing them in folders.

Docs is essentially using the same model as Gmail. ‘All Documents’ is an inbox, folders are essentially labels (in that you can store a single copy of a file in multiple folders), and ‘Hide’ performs the same function as ‘Archive’. What allows this model to work for email as well as documents, spreadsheets and various other kinds of files is Google’s powerful search functionality.

This simple system allowed you to feel like you were in control of your data and find it again quickly when required. As the volume of data and the types of files grew (and it grew exponentially – <em>exploded</em> really) the model struggled to keep up. If you had photos, video, written documents and maybe even audio all related to one project, you suddenly had to decide whether to file content away by type or by context.

When I think about my favourite directors the names that come to mind tend to be people with long and varied filmographies, and Van Sant&rsquo;s name is right near the top of that list.

There&rsquo;s no doubting the film is well made, but it&rsquo;s the script and the performances that are doing the heavy lifting; supporting evidence came a couple of years later when Van Sant essentially tried to make the same film again in the form of <em>Finding Forrester</em> (2000) with lesser results.

His camera likes to linger and wander, scenes play out un-rushed, characters mumble and shuffle, often Van Sant movies are not pretty but they are stylistically flawless. When <em>Elephant</em> (2003) came out it seemed to me to be a singular artistic statement which expressed in one stroke a whole swathe of pent-up, suppressed and otherwise inexpressible thoughts and feelings that had been bubbling under the western liberal psyche since those twin millennium-straddling events: the Columbine high school shootings of 1999 and the attacks on New York and Washington DC in September 2001. The subject matter of the film is obviously more closely modelled on the former, but as someone who was moving into adulthood at the time of those events I remember a distinct feeling of things slipping, getting worse, and a confusion that went with it. Somehow Van Sant got that on film; he captured something which other artists in all mediums were finding elusive. <em>Elephant</em> feels to me talismanic in some way, a coherent expression of something inexpressible, comparable to the relationship of Picasso&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guernica&rsquo; to the Spanish Civil War.</p>\n<p>On a more personal level I had no particular desire to see the story of Kurt Cobain&rsquo;s suicide put up on screen, but Van Sant&rsquo;s 2005 film <em>Last Days</em> is touching, poignant, thoughtful and respectful in perfect measure.

Limited edition vinyl pressings and packed-in hardcover art books are one thing, but really they are just a means of seeming to rarefy something which can be bought far more cheaply in an unadorned form (or acquired without charge if you are of threadbare moral fibre).

				"content_text": "In an age of infinite duplication, when what we mean by photography or film or music is (with increasing commonality) a digital file easily reproducible as an exact copy of itself, there is something revolutionary about the very idea of a unique artwork.

Throughout the novel the protagonist moves from one club to another, one penthouse to another, one party to another – all the time gathering a terrible momentum which takes him to worse places, worse situations, worse people….</p>\n<p>At first the people we meet are merely reprehensible. Every character Ellis introduces is obsessed with status and perception: lazy, rich, bored, self-interested to the point of obliviousness. They are so self-involved that they never show genuine interest in others, never remember details unless they pertain to themselves, and never form any genuine connections. There’s Kim, who learns her parents’ whereabouts from <em>Variety</em>; and Ronnette, convinced that the world will melt if she doesn’t dye her hair. In Ellis’s LA the bonds of money, drugs, and sex have primacy over friendship, family, and genuine intimacy.</p>\n<p>Consider the paucity of true communication in this interchange between Blair and Clay:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Clay?” she whispers loudly.<br>\nI stop but don’t turn around. “Yeah?”<br>\n“Nothing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The dramatic weight of a loud whisper, the refusal to face the person who called your name, and then the terminus – another stillborn conversation between two people afraid of really speaking to one another rather than acting a part. These are people whose life is a constant drift between moments in which they are never truly engaged, and as a result a lack of certainty pervades every layer of the novel. Characters rarely have surnames, cases of mistaken identity are frequent, even Clay’s narration is full of holes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And somewhere along the line, Blair leaves with Rip or maybe with Trent, or maybe Rip leaves with Trent or maybe Rip leaves with the two blond girls, and I end up dancing with this girl and she leans over to me and whispers that maybe we should go to her place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At points Clay leaves out salient detail presumably due to lack of attention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mumble something… After taking him to some emergency room at some hospital, we go to a coffee shop on Wilshire…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note how the location of the coffee shop is recalled and relayed effortlessly. Brand names, street names, the names of hip clubs all carry a weight of importance absent from other areas of the characters’ lives.</p>\n<p>And things only get worse. Throughout the novel there are a number of catalogues of disturbing material. Early on Clay recalls one summer that he collected newspaper reports on acts of horrendous violence “because, I guess there were a lot to be collected.” Towards the novel’s conclusion Clay recalls a similar number of violent acts (man-made and natural) that happened whilst he was in LA; the tumult is constant. And Clay is also collecting something else, even if unconsciously: fragments that hold some meaning for him, beginning with the book’s opening line and continuing throughout. These phrases, often with dark portent, appear in the narration once and then stick, Clay often repeating them at moments when he’s feeling most uncomfortable. So, whilst high at a tense family meal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think about Blair alone in her bed stroking that stupid black cat and the billboard that says, ‘Disappear Here’ and Julian’s eyes and wonder if he’s for sale and people are afraid to merge…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And whilst witnessing the nadir of Julian’s arc, as the pimp Finn threatens him and injects him with drugs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disappear Here.<br>\nThe syringe fills with blood.<br>\nYou’re a beautiful boy and that’s all that matters.<br>\nWonder if he’s for sale.<br>\nPeople are afraid to merge. To merge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a panic attack in print. A loss of narrative coherence. Clay’s conscience screaming at him to take note, to be present in a moment and to feel something – to react. Eventually, at his most honest, he comes to realise that all that matters to him “is that I want to see the worst.”</p>\n<p>This is an almost miraculous level of self-awareness for Clay – nothing short of a revelation which it takes him almost the entire novel to come to. It is obviously not a positive change in his character but it is an important first step. Axiomatically the first step in recovery from addiction is to admit that you have a problem: Clay’s addiction is to detachment and here he is working his way towards admitting it.</p>\n<p>There have been signs throughout the novel that he wanted this. The half-dozen or so italicised passages in which Clay reminisces about earlier periods in his life contain little more in the way of genuine emotion than is found in his reporting of the present, so we know it’s something that he is capable of. At points he has to push back against the emerging idea that something is wrong, for example at the party in Malibu when he first notices that all of the attendees look alike and then starts “to wonder if I look just like them. I try to forget about it…”</p>\n<p>Almost as soon as he voices his desire to see “the worst,” his wish is granted, as he finds himself out behind the club Flip with Rip and Spin (consider the disruptive connotations of all of those proper nouns), and in their company he reaches a new low.</p>\n<p>The book’s darkest moments – the paedophilic rape and the video of a similar act that foreshadows it – are the far end of an experience spectrum for their deadened observers and perpetrators. These are the most extreme incidences of characters submitting themselves to ever greater levels of stimulation in the hope of being able to feel something, whilst at the same time remaining mortally afraid of doing just that.</p>\n<p>Only at the pressured depths late in the novel, once he has sunk further, been closer to “the worst,” is Clay able to admit his dependence on detachment. In the novel’s closing moments Clay has a conversation with Blair that reveals him at his most emotionally honest: admitting to his emotional bankruptcy. She asks him,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘What do you care about? What makes you happy?’<br>\n‘Nothing. Nothing makes me happy.

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>\nBut I have promises to keep,<br>\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,<br>\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last stanza, and really just those last two lines, of Robert Frost&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening&rsquo; (1923) always struck me as a little bleak; it gives an otherwise pretty poem a hint of something which might be longing or even despair. This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning novel finds a man (Viggo Mortensen) also possessed of the need to keep moving and the desire to keep promises. We witness him telling his wife (Charlize Theron) that he will &ldquo;do whatever it takes&rdquo; to help their family survive the apocalypse which is upon them, and over the 111 minutes of John Hillcoat&rsquo;s film he is put to that test again and again.</p>\n<p>Theron&rsquo;s part is fleeting, as is that of every other cast member save Mortensen and his character&rsquo;s son, The Boy, as played by 13 year old Kodi Smit-McPhee. The film boils down to two hours spent in their company as they do little more than try to survive in a blighted landscape. Hillcoat punctuates the journey nicely with set pieces such as encounters with gangs of cannibals or the discovery of a bunker stocked with food, and also with Mortensen&rsquo;s The Man remembering or dreaming of his life in the Before with his wife. The Man wakes from these dreams with a start and a cry; part of him wishes to relinquish all memory of the past as it causes him such pain. In one scene we watch as he nudges his wedding ring ever closer to a precipice, but in the end he cannot make the final push. This is what The Man seems to fear most: his inability to follow through, to keep those promises. We watch as he instructs his son on the proper way to commit suicide, and listen in as he ponders in voice-over whether he would be able to take The Boy&rsquo;s life if it came to it. Hillcoat handles this material, all of which he inherits from McCarthy, with a deft hand, never overplaying the heartache nor being afraid to show it when it is required. For all of its post-apocalyptic trappings this is at its heart a love story, and one concerned with that love rarest of all on the cinema screen: that between a father and son. McCarthy dedicates his novel to his own son, and Hillcoat and Mortensen correctly identifies that as the story&rsquo;s most powerful and most important thread.</p>\n<p>Mortensen&rsquo;s performance is necessarily understated in that his character lacks energy and is sickening as the film progresses, but he is the kind of actor who can do a lot by doing very little. Hillcoat wisely shoots his star&rsquo;s face in close-up so that we can see all of the expression Mortensen is putting behind The Man&rsquo;s words (Joe Penhall does an admirable job of appropriating and supplementing McCarthy&rsquo;s sparse and repetitive, yet beautiful, dialogue). And Smit-McPhee, in his first major role, does exceedingly well with very difficult material, which arguably requires more emotion from his character than from his fellow lead&rsquo;s. Watching him enjoy his first and probably last Coca-Cola is touching because he reacts with believable joy.</p>\n<p>Hillcoat has also assembled an impressive supporting cast, with Michael Kenneth Willams and Guy Pearce doing well with minimal screen time. If there is a performance which outshines Mortensen&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Robert Duvall as The Old Man; restrained but astonishingly emotive and moving he is every inch the defeated old soul that the film requires, giving a glimpse of what longevity might bring for The Boy. Like the film&rsquo;s protagonists The Old Man is going onwards simply because there is nothing else to do; he provides a possible answer to the Beckettian question which McCarthy is asking: of what value is it to simply carry on for the sake of carrying on?</p>\n<p>Javier Aguirresarobe&rsquo;s cinematography makes for an oddly beautiful film. Though the landscape in which the story is set is ruined his camera gives it a majesty by allowing us to see the scope and variety of the devastation. His palette is as washed out and bleak in the majority of the scenes as it is vivid and beautiful in the few remembrances The Man allows himself; one simple image of Theron in a sun-dress lingers long after the end credits. The tone of the film is also supported wonderfully by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis&rsquo;s score. Simple and haunting it is loaded with loss and longing; its composers obviously understanding the heart of the film just as well as its director and leading man. As well as the sad strings and plaintive piano of the score though, Hillcoat makes masterful use throughout of environmental noise. Almost from start to finish The Man and The Boy are surrounded by the sound of the world collapsing, giving in or straining at the seams. The tearing crash of falling trees, the groan and growl of rending earth and deep percussive booms that sound like icebergs breaking apart, all frame the landscape wonderfully and make the environment as prominent a part of the story as it should be.</p>\n<p>In many respects John Hillcoat was in a lose / lose situation when he signed on to make The Road. Had he gone for a strict adaptation of McCarthy&rsquo;s novel it would have made for a practically un-watchable film. Stray too far from the beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning source and all of its many admirers would be sure to point out his film&rsquo;s failings. Add to that the fact that the last adaptation of the author&rsquo;s work (the Coen brothers' <em>No Country For Old Men</em> (2007)) won four of the most prestigious Academy Awards and you have a project freighted with impossible expectations. Hillcoat walks this tightrope with admirable surety and he has made a film which is a perfect balance of McCarthy&rsquo;s vision and his own. It is best enjoyed as a cinematic article, divorced from the source text, but excellent performances and masterful film-making should make that easy.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "> The woods are lovely, dark and deep.  \n> But I have promises to keep,  \n> And miles to go before I sleep,  \n> And miles to go before I sleep.  \n\nThat last stanza, and really just those last two lines, of Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening' (1923) always struck me as a little bleak; it gives an otherwise pretty poem a hint of something which might be longing or even despair. This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning novel finds a man (Viggo Mortensen) also possessed of the need to keep moving and the desire to keep promises. We witness him telling his wife (Charlize Theron) that he will \"do whatever it takes\" to help their family survive the apocalypse which is upon them, and over the 111 minutes of John Hillcoat's film he is put to that test again and again.\n\nTheron's part is fleeting, as is that of every other cast member save Mortensen and his character's son, The Boy, as played by 13 year old Kodi Smit-McPhee.

This is a debate I'm going to have to have again if Taylor Swift does re-record *Red* and *1989* as she has said she intends to. \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",
