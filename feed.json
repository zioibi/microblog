				"content_html": "<p>If chess isn&rsquo;t your thing (yet), you would be forgiven for thinking that chess is chess. But even for games played by the normal rules of chess, there‚Äôs a huge variety of time controls that have dramatic impacts on play. You can, of course, play without any time limit, free to leave <em>days</em> between moves if you wish. Games at the FIDE World Cup ‚Äî which is in its final stages at the moment ‚Äî¬†are played with 90 minutes on each player‚Äôs clock for the first 40 moves, and an additional 30 minutes added after move 40. Also, 30 seconds are added per move. This is a version of the classical chess format, which has endured throughout the game‚Äôs long history. But other time controls have gained popularity, perhaps particularly since the advent of online chess. There is Rapid chess, where players might start with anything from 60 minutes to 10 minutes on the clock; Blitz, where clocks start with five or even three minutes, and sometimes two seconds might be added per move; and Bullet, where games can start with as little as 30 seconds on the clock!</p>\n<p>But those are just the chess formats that use the normal rules. There are also numerous variations that tweak the way the game itself is played. For example, there is Chess960, wherein the order of pieces on each player‚Äôs home rank is randomised; Crazyhouse, in which pieces you capture can be redeployed on your side; and 4 Player Chess, in which‚Ä¶ there are four players, and four sets of pieces on one (larger) board. And that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant\">chess variants</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>There has also been an explosion in the number and variety of chess video games, many of which feature fun spins on the game. See, as just two examples, <a href=\"https://shotgun-king.com/\"><em>Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</em></a>, and Zach Gage‚Äôs <a href=\"http://reallybadchess.com/\"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>.</p>\n<p>I mention <strong>all of this</strong> because I recently had an idea for a new variation, which I‚Äôm calling Meteorite Chess. The game uses the usual setup of chess pieces, and proceeds as a normal game of chess. The twist is that at set intervals (ie. every three or five moves) one square on the board becomes highlighted, and after the subsequent moves, that square is hit by a meteorite. I can see there being two versions of the game: Meteorite &amp; Meteorite Oblivion. In the latter version, when the meteorite hits the highlighted square, any piece on that square is destroyed, and removed from the board. This is the simpler version of the game, but it still requires both players to adapt their play to accommodate squares which become temporarily hazardous. The game design trick would be in making sure that the squares were selected in a fair way. For example, no squares on the 1, 2, 7, or 8 ranks should probably be targeted at the beginning of the game. Perhaps they become eligible to be meteor struck after 30 moves, incentivising players to develop their pieces earlier. The fun of the game would be to embrace its randomness, but there could also be tweaks to guard against the feeling of unfairness ‚Äî¬†eg. a setting to provide two moves‚Äô worth of warning before a meteor strikes.</p>\n<p>In the non-Oblivion version of the game, things get a little trickier, and perhaps a little more interesting. Here, instead of destroying the piece on the targeted square, the meteorite <em>devolves</em> it to a lesser piece. So, a struck queen becomes a rook; a rook becomes a knight or bishop; a bishop becomes a pawn; and a struck pawn is destroyed. In the majority of instances, this would still prove an incentive for players to avoid the targeted square, <em>but</em> it would give rise to fascinating board states where it might prove beneficial for a player to deliberately move a rook onto the highlighted square, because devolving it into a knight would provide a positional advantage! Again, there are options here to tweak the rules to make things more or less punishing: perhaps a setting that includes some devolving meteorites, and some that outright destroy, as well as the option to either indicate which type of meteorite is coming, or not. Heck, maybe there could even be <em>evolving</em> meteorites, which would increase struck pieces: knight to rook; rook to Queen etc.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://adam.micro.blog/2022/04/21/idea-for-a.html\">I‚Äôve said here before</a>, I‚Äôm not a game designer.

The fun of the game would be to embrace its randomness, but there could also be tweaks to guard against the feeling of unfairness ‚Äî¬†eg. a setting to provide two moves‚Äô worth of warning before a meteor strikes. \n\nIn the non-Oblivion version of the game, things get a little trickier, and perhaps a little more interesting. Here, instead of destroying the piece on the targeted square, the meteorite *devolves* it to a lesser piece. So, a struck queen becomes a rook; a rook becomes a knight or bishop; a bishop becomes a pawn; and a struck pawn is destroyed. In the majority of instances, this would still prove an incentive for players to avoid the targeted square, *but* it would give rise to fascinating board states where it might prove beneficial for a player to deliberately move a rook onto the highlighted square, because devolving it into a knight would provide a positional advantage! Again, there are options here to tweak the rules to make things more or less punishing: perhaps a setting that includes some devolving meteorites, and some that outright destroy, as well as the option to either indicate which type of meteorite is coming, or not. Heck, maybe there could even be *evolving* meteorites, which would increase struck pieces: knight to rook; rook to Queen etc. \n\nAs [I‚Äôve said here before](https://adam.micro.blog/2022/04/21/idea-for-a.html), I‚Äôm not a game designer. But if anyone reading this would like to make use of this idea, feel free! ‚ôüÔ∏è\n\n[^1]: If Crazyhouse sounds like fun to you, take a look at [Bughouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess)!\n",

So, just for the record, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is a perfect song; the guitar lick at 2:09 would be on my list of top 5 <em>moments</em> in recorded music<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. It was my introduction to the band, at age 14, in my high school computer room. The inclusion of the (all-time great) music video on the Windows 95 install CD remains both inexplicable, and sort of magical in my mind. So yes, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is not on this list, but‚Ä¶ you know üòâ</p>\n<h3 id=\"jamie-1993\">Jamie (1993)</h3>\n<p>Only fitting then, that my first pick<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> is the b-side from the ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô single. Holy smokes! Has there ever been a better a-side / b-side CD single?<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> Rivers Cuomo is famously prolific, and he has an ear for melody that is second-to-none. I can‚Äôt imagine any other artists dashing off a quirky, sweet paean to their band‚Äôs lawyer. That opening feedback, the rumbling riff, the heartfelt lyrics, chant-along bridge, croon-along chorus. Weird and wonderful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-gave-your-love-to-me-softly-1995\">You Gave Your Love to Me Softly (1995)</h3>\n<p>Maybe the world‚Äôs sweetest 100mph rock ballad? A riff that burns like a lit fuse; another extremely ‚Äòjoin in at full volume‚Äô chorus; a squealer of a solo‚Ä¶ all packed in to less than two minutes. Guaranteed to stick in my head for hours every time I listen to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-just-threw-out-the-love-of-my-dreams-1996\">I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams (1996)</h3>\n<p>A sad / sweet synth rock masterpiece with one of my absolute favourite vocal melodies. Rachel Haden is flawless, and the bridge, with its duet vocal, is perfect. Add in Rivers somehow shredding a synth, and building the whole thing to a soaring finish. Unbeatable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sheila-can-do-it-1996--2020\">Sheila Can Do It (1996 / 2020)</h3>\n<p>How about an album track? And a recent one too, just to prove I‚Äôm not an insufferable hipster. For me, this is easily the highlight of Weezer‚Äôs last 15 years.

				"content_text": "You can blame this one on [Brett Seybert](https://brett.seybert.me/2023/07/19/the-best-weezer.html) ‚Äî who in turn is blaming it on [Luke O‚ÄôNeil](https://www.welcometohellworld.com/the-world-has-turned-and-left-me-here/) ‚Äî¬† but I‚Äôll never pass up a chance to talk Weezer, so here we go. \n\nTo begin, let me say that I‚Äôm calling this the ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô Memorial List, for two reasons: a) the band‚Äôs most famous song[^1] is too easy a pick; b) it‚Äôs unbeatable and I need to cheat to get it on this list somehow. So, just for the record, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is a perfect song; the guitar lick at 2:09 would be on my list of top 5 *moments* in recorded music[^2]. It was my introduction to the band, at age 14, in my high school computer room. The inclusion of the (all-time great) music video on the Windows 95 install CD remains both inexplicable, and sort of magical in my mind. So yes, ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô is not on this list, but‚Ä¶ you know üòâ\n\n### Jamie (1993)\nOnly fitting then, that my first pick[^3] is the b-side from the ‚ÄòBuddy Holly‚Äô single. Holy smokes! Has there ever been a better a-side / b-side CD single?[^4] Rivers Cuomo is famously prolific, and he has an ear for melody that is second-to-none. I can‚Äôt imagine any other artists dashing off a quirky, sweet paean to their band‚Äôs lawyer. That opening feedback, the rumbling riff, the heartfelt lyrics, chant-along bridge, croon-along chorus. Weird and wonderful. \n\n### You Gave Your Love to Me Softly (1995)\nMaybe the world‚Äôs sweetest 100mph rock ballad? A riff that burns like a lit fuse; another extremely ‚Äòjoin in at full volume‚Äô chorus; a squealer of a solo‚Ä¶ all packed in to less than two minutes. Guaranteed to stick in my head for hours every time I listen to it. \n\n### I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams (1996)\nA sad / sweet synth rock masterpiece with one of my absolute favourite vocal melodies. Rachel Haden is flawless, and the bridge, with its duet vocal, is perfect. Add in Rivers somehow shredding a synth, and building the whole thing to a soaring finish. Unbeatable. \n\n### Sheila Can Do It (1996 / 2020)\nHow about an album track? And a recent one too, just to prove I‚Äôm not an insufferable hipster. For me, this is easily the highlight of Weezer‚Äôs last 15 years. That it‚Äôs core is essentially unchanged from the 1996 demo version probably says something, but I adore this sing-song vocal melody and playful riff. The bridge and chorus are unimpeachable. \n\n### Listen Up (2001)\nOK, I‚Äôm an insufferable hipster. This is probably one of my favourite songs ever, by any artist, and it‚Äôs a demo from the peak of Rivers‚Äô hyper-productive period around the Green album when every b-side and off-cut was better than what was ending up on other bands‚Äô albums. The dynamics of this song are a marvel to me, and perfectly capture a seemingly effortless knack for imbuing simple pop melodies with aching beauty.

Do people think of ‚ÄòHash Pipe‚Äô and / or ‚ÄòBeverly Hills‚Äô now, when you mention Weezer?

Over that decade-plus ‚Äî¬†in which I‚Äôve owned four different models ‚Äî Apple has worked to ensure that the iPhone has increasingly become the centre of a whole ecosystem of devices and services. The upshot of this strategy (and, indeed, the purpose of it), is that there are significant obstacles for anyone considering a move <em>away</em> from Apple‚Äôs phone. As an experiment, I thought I‚Äôd do some thinking about what it would mean for me to make the switch.</p>\n<p>As a starting point, let‚Äôs consider each of the apps currently on my iPhone‚Äôs Home Screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/home-screen.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†no Android version is available, but I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of calendar apps that would make a fine substitute. However, I would then need to figure out what calendar apps to use on iPad and Mac. At present Fantastical is syncing the iCloud calendars associated with my Apple ID, so I might even need to find a new solution for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather</strong> ‚Äî not a problem; I‚Äôm sure there are good Android weather apps.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></strong> ‚Äî there actually <em>is</em> an Android version of Apple‚Äôs music service, so I wouldn‚Äôt need to make a switch.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†this one‚Äôs easy, as there‚Äôs an Android version.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminders</strong> ‚Äî¬†again, there are certainly acceptable substitutes for this in the Play Store, <em>but</em> one of my main uses of Reminders is for shopping lists shared with my partner. It works seamlessly because our Apple IDs are associated as a family. Getting the same functionality elsewhere would be relatively easy, but would require asking my partner to download a different app ‚Äî¬†annoying.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a></strong> ‚Äî no Android version is available, and that‚Äôs a significant issue. I‚Äôve used Cultured Code‚Äôs task manager to pretty much run my life since January 2010<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. It‚Äôs an essential part of how I think about organising things, and I use it everywhere: Mac, iPad, &amp; Apple Watch, but <em>primarily</em> iPhone. Moving away from it would be tricky. My second choice ‚Äî OmniFocus ‚Äî¬†also doesn‚Äôt have an Android version. I‚Äôd have to resort to something like Todoist, which would also incur a paid subscription (unlike Things).</p>\n<p><strong>Photos</strong> ‚Äî¬†another strong argument for iCloud‚Äôs flawless syncing between devices. I‚Äôve been using these things long enough to remember when every photo I took on my phone <em>didn‚Äôt</em> automatically appear on all my other devices. But I‚Äôm absolutely spoiled by it now, and I don‚Äôt want to go back to the days of using middle-man services (eg. syncing to Google Photos, and bridging that to iCloud?) to make sure everything‚Äôs available everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hey.com\">HEY</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†another easy one: there‚Äôs an Android version of my email client.</p>\n<p><strong>Messages</strong> ‚Äî¬†ah, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BuaKzm7Kq9Q\">blue bubble vs green bubble</a> dilemma! Amongst friends and family, iMessage is by far my most commonly used messaging platform. Yes, between WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, &amp; SMS, there are plenty of other options, but the inconvenience of a move away from iMessage isn‚Äôt to be underestimated.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thebrowser.company/\">Arc</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†not a huge loss at present, and perhaps The Browser Company will eventually bring this to Android.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†another cross-platform win: an Android version of this journalling app is available.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†there‚Äôs no Android version of my preferred Mastodon client, and indeed the options look very limited. I‚Äôd probably have to switch back to the official app, which is fine, but not a patch on Ivory.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://getmatter.com\">Matter</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†my read-it-later service of choice doesn‚Äôt have an Android app, so I‚Äôd have to switch away from it to an alternative, like Instapaper, Pocket, or Readwise. I don‚Äôt do a lot of the actual <em>reading</em> on iPhone though<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, so perhaps I could figure out an alternative method of saving items into Matter on the phone, one option being via email.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†a first class Android version of this blogging application is available!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://marcosatanaka.com/\">MusicBox</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Marcos Tanaka‚Äôs music tracking app has become an important part of my listening experience. The fact that no Android version is available would put a major kink in my daily work towards compiling my <a href=\"https://adam.micro.blog/thelists\">end of year list</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Similar to Matter (above), my feed-reader of choice (since 2009) is also not available on Android. Again, most of the actual reading gets done elsewhere (iPad &amp; Mac), but I‚Äôm not discounting the annoyance of having one device missing from that setup.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://sonos.com\">Sonos</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†no issues here: the controller for my home audio system is available on Android.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://threads.net\">Threads</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†Meta‚Äôs new microblogging platform is by no means an essential part of my digital life, and surely headed to Android in the near future<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Safari</strong> ‚Äî¬†I like Safari‚Äôs privacy-first approach, but I don‚Äôt use any of its syncing features (largely because I use Arc as my browser of choice on Mac). Switching to Firefox or something similar on Android wouldn‚Äôt be a major pain point.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://1password.com\">1Password</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†luckily my preferred password manager is available everywhere, otherwise this would have been a deal-breaker.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†I‚Äôm not married to one particular note-taking application, and I could find something that would work across platforms; perhaps even something with a web / browser version, which would be nice.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://tot.rocks/\">Tot</a></strong> ‚Äî¬†this simple scratchpad is an excellent example of a little application that I use all the time, and which relies entirely upon instant iCloud syncing. I <em>could</em> live without it, but I‚Äôd prefer not to!</p>\n<p>Looking past the first page, the other stumbling blocks that I can foresee are largely tied to Apple‚Äôs own software &amp; services.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¢ I use FaceTime with family, all of whom <em>could</em> be persuaded to use a platform agnostic alternative, but why should they change their setups for me?<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ I use Apple Fitness+ quite a bit, and replacements a) tend to be more expensive, &amp; b) won‚Äôt integrate perfectly with my Apple Watch.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ Contacts and Wallet both have native Android allegories, but that would mean managing data in both places: eg. adding or updating a contact on both iOS and Android.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ There are a lot of little ecosystem touches that would break if I had a non-Apple phone: eg. using the phone keyboard, and auto-filling passwords on Apple TV (much easier than navigating an onscreen keyboard with a remote); setting alarms (and choosing music for them) on my HomePod. In both cases I <em>could</em> pull out the iPad each time, but it‚Äôs not ideal.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ Not a huge deal, but I also have a case, a MagSafe Wallet, and a MagSafe charger, all of which are highly likely to be compatible with the next iPhone, and are all incompatible with non-Apple options</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In short, switching away from iPhone to an Android device would incur a dozen or so penalties ranging from irksome to genuinely annoying. The penalties for staying <em>with</em> iPhone, of course, are twofold:<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ No choice as to which operating system you use: you just have what Apple gives you. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/\">iOS 17</a> looks just fine, and has some neat additions, <em>but</em> it is clearly another iteration (and a relatively modest one) on the same design that has persisted since iOS 7 debuted a <strong>decade</strong> ago. Variety is one of Android‚Äôs selling points, and Nothing‚Äôs OS (for example) has a distinct look that feels genuinely new.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n‚Ä¢ A ~¬£300 premium on each upgrade. As mentioned, I‚Äôve had four iPhones in 12 years, or an upgrade roughly every three years. If the difference between an iPhone and a perfectly capable Android device is ¬£300 each time, that adds up.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons I have mixed feelings about all of this, is that I‚Äôm the same person who was, <a href=\"https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html\">not so long ago</a><sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>, espousing the virtues of not tying oneself into centralised social platforms ‚Äî¬†of operating independent of any one company‚Äôs choices over your experience. And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I‚Äôve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, <em>of course</em> I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem work together. But I‚Äôm not going to pretend there isn‚Äôt a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I have receipts!&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>That‚Äôs reserved largely for the iPad.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>possibly before they launch a web version!?&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>and <a href=\"https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html\">not for the first time</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

The upshot of this strategy (and, indeed, the purpose of it), is that there are significant obstacles for anyone considering a move *away* from Apple‚Äôs phone. As an experiment, I thought I‚Äôd do some thinking about what it would mean for me to make the switch. \n\nAs a starting point, let‚Äôs consider each of the apps currently on my iPhone‚Äôs Home Screen: \n\n![](https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/home-screen.png)\n\n**[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)** ‚Äî¬†no Android version is available, but I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of calendar apps that would make a fine substitute. However, I would then need to figure out what calendar apps to use on iPad and Mac. At present Fantastical is syncing the iCloud calendars associated with my Apple ID, so I might even need to find a new solution for that. \n\n**Weather** ‚Äî not a problem; I‚Äôm sure there are good Android weather apps.\n\n**[Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/)** ‚Äî there actually *is* an Android version of Apple‚Äôs music service, so I wouldn‚Äôt need to make a switch. \n\n**[Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/)** ‚Äî¬†this one‚Äôs easy, as there‚Äôs an Android version. \n\n**Reminders** ‚Äî¬†again, there are certainly acceptable substitutes for this in the Play Store, *but* one of my main uses of Reminders is for shopping lists shared with my partner. It works seamlessly because our Apple IDs are associated as a family. Getting the same functionality elsewhere would be relatively easy, but would require asking my partner to download a different app ‚Äî¬†annoying. \n\n**[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)** ‚Äî no Android version is available, and that‚Äôs a significant issue. I‚Äôve used Cultured Code‚Äôs task manager to pretty much run my life since January 2010[^1]. It‚Äôs an essential part of how I think about organising things, and I use it everywhere: Mac, iPad, & Apple Watch, but *primarily* iPhone. Moving away from it would be tricky. My second choice ‚Äî OmniFocus ‚Äî¬†also doesn‚Äôt have an Android version. I‚Äôd have to resort to something like Todoist, which would also incur a paid subscription (unlike Things). \n\n**Photos** ‚Äî¬†another strong argument for iCloud‚Äôs flawless syncing between devices. I‚Äôve been using these things long enough to remember when every photo I took on my phone *didn‚Äôt* automatically appear on all my other devices. But I‚Äôm absolutely spoiled by it now, and I don‚Äôt want to go back to the days of using middle-man services (eg. syncing to Google Photos, and bridging that to iCloud?) to make sure everything‚Äôs available everywhere.\n\n**[HEY](https://hey.com)** ‚Äî¬†another easy one: there‚Äôs an Android version of my email client.\n\n**Messages** ‚Äî¬†ah, the [blue bubble vs green bubble](https://youtu.be/BuaKzm7Kq9Q) dilemma! Amongst friends and family, iMessage is by far my most commonly used messaging platform. Yes, between WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, & SMS, there are plenty of other options, but the inconvenience of a move away from iMessage isn‚Äôt to be underestimated. \n\n**[Arc](https://thebrowser.company/)** ‚Äî¬†not a huge loss at present, and perhaps The Browser Company will eventually bring this to Android. \n\n**[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/)** ‚Äî¬†another cross-platform win: an Android version of this journalling app is available. \n\n**[Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/)** ‚Äî¬†there‚Äôs no Android version of my preferred Mastodon client, and indeed the options look very limited. I‚Äôd probably have to switch back to the official app, which is fine, but not a patch on Ivory. \n\n**[Matter](https://getmatter.com)** ‚Äî¬†my read-it-later service of choice doesn‚Äôt have an Android app, so I‚Äôd have to switch away from it to an alternative, like Instapaper, Pocket, or Readwise. I don‚Äôt do a lot of the actual *reading* on iPhone though[^2], so perhaps I could figure out an alternative method of saving items into Matter on the phone, one option being via email. \n\n**[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog)** ‚Äî¬†a first class Android version of this blogging application is available!\n\n**[MusicBox](https://marcosatanaka.com/)** ‚Äî¬†Marcos Tanaka‚Äôs music tracking app has become an important part of my listening experience. The fact that no Android version is available would put a major kink in my daily work towards compiling my [end of year list](https://adam.micro.blog/thelists). \n\n**[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/)** ‚Äî¬†Similar to Matter (above), my feed-reader of choice (since 2009) is also not available on Android. Again, most of the actual reading gets done elsewhere (iPad & Mac), but I‚Äôm not discounting the annoyance of having one device missing from that setup. \n\n**[Sonos](https://sonos.com)** ‚Äî¬†no issues here: the controller for my home audio system is available on Android. \n\n**[Threads](https://threads.net)** ‚Äî¬†Meta‚Äôs new microblogging platform is by no means an essential part of my digital life, and surely headed to Android in the near future[^3]. \n\n**Safari** ‚Äî¬†I like Safari‚Äôs privacy-first approach, but I don‚Äôt use any of its syncing features (largely because I use Arc as my browser of choice on Mac). Switching to Firefox or something similar on Android wouldn‚Äôt be a major pain point. \n\n**[1Password](https://1password.com)** ‚Äî¬†luckily my preferred password manager is available everywhere, otherwise this would have been a deal-breaker. \n\n**[Bear](https://bear.app/)** ‚Äî¬†I‚Äôm not married to one particular note-taking application, and I could find something that would work across platforms; perhaps even something with a web / browser version, which would be nice. \n\n**[Tot](https://tot.rocks/)** ‚Äî¬†this simple scratchpad is an excellent example of a little application that I use all the time, and which relies entirely upon instant iCloud syncing. I *could* live without it, but I‚Äôd prefer not to! \n\nLooking past the first page, the other stumbling blocks that I can foresee are largely tied to Apple‚Äôs own software & services.\n\n‚Ä¢ I use FaceTime with family, all of whom *could* be persuaded to use a platform agnostic alternative, but why should they change their setups for me?  \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ I use Apple Fitness+ quite a bit, and replacements a) tend to be more expensive, & b) won‚Äôt integrate perfectly with my Apple Watch.  \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ Contacts and Wallet both have native Android allegories, but that would mean managing data in both places: eg. adding or updating a contact on both iOS and Android.   \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ There are a lot of little ecosystem touches that would break if I had a non-Apple phone: eg. using the phone keyboard, and auto-filling passwords on Apple TV (much easier than navigating an onscreen keyboard with a remote); setting alarms (and choosing music for them) on my HomePod. In both cases I *could* pull out the iPad each time, but it‚Äôs not ideal.   \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ Not a huge deal, but I also have a case, a MagSafe Wallet, and a MagSafe charger, all of which are highly likely to be compatible with the next iPhone, and are all incompatible with non-Apple options  \n\n\n---- \nIn short, switching away from iPhone to an Android device would incur a dozen or so penalties ranging from irksome to genuinely annoying. The penalties for staying *with* iPhone, of course, are twofold:  \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ No choice as to which operating system you use: you just have what Apple gives you. [iOS 17](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/) looks just fine, and has some neat additions, *but* it is clearly another iteration (and a relatively modest one) on the same design that has persisted since iOS 7 debuted a **decade** ago. Variety is one of Android‚Äôs selling points, and Nothing‚Äôs OS (for example) has a distinct look that feels genuinely new.   \n<br>\n‚Ä¢ A ~¬£300 premium on each upgrade. As mentioned, I‚Äôve had four iPhones in 12 years, or an upgrade roughly every three years. If the difference between an iPhone and a perfectly capable Android device is ¬£300 each time, that adds up. \n\nOne of the reasons I have mixed feelings about all of this, is that I‚Äôm the same person who was, [not so long ago](https://adam.micro.blog/2023/07/05/hey-are-you.html)[^4], espousing the virtues of not tying oneself into centralised social platforms ‚Äî¬†of operating independent of any one company‚Äôs choices over your experience. And yet here I am lamenting the fact that I‚Äôve voluntarily accrued enough Apple hardware, software, and services, that it would be a pain to break free of them. Yes, *of course* I appreciate on a daily basis how well all of the components of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem work together. But I‚Äôm not going to pretend there isn‚Äôt a downside, and it comes in the form of lock-in. \n\n[^1]:\tI have receipts!\n\n[^2]:\tThat‚Äôs reserved largely for the iPad.\n\n[^3]:\tpossibly before they launch a web version!?\n\n[^4]:\tand [not for the first time](https://adam.micro.blog/2023/01/01/i-know-im.html)\n",

There's life out there, to varying degrees, and it's been fun keeping an eye on how things are evolving. \n\nI'll always keep my own site; it's too important to the way I feel about the web for me not to have a spot that's all my own, and subject to no on else's decision making. No adverts, no cookies, no analytics, and full control over everything I publish. I'd encourage anyone who values what they're posting online to  think about adopting the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) mindset: 'Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere'. \n\nBut the social web has its place too, and right now I feel a little as though I'm still looking for a perfect fit. \n\n‚Ä¢¬†**Twitter** is increasingly a far-right cesspool, and its server architecture seems to be actively on fire.  \n\n‚Ä¢¬†My impression of **Bluesky** has been that it seems chock full of people trying desperately to be funny all the time, which can be exhausting.  \n\n‚Ä¢ I dig my **Mastodon** experience, but it‚Äôs super niche: mainly people talking about open-source projects, blogging, and the fediverse.  \n\nToday, Meta launched their microblogging platform: [**Threads**](https://threads.net), and it feels like it has a genuine chance at mass adoption. Leveraging users' already established Instagram social graph gives it a significant jump start. It's super early, and the v1 released a few hours ago is missing features that may be considered basic (eg. a timeline of accounts you're following; a browser-based interface; hashtags; availability in the <sc>EU</sc>!), but it feels like there's a chance it could provide a place for people to just post about brunch again. \n\nPut another way: a lot of the family, friends, and accounts I previously followed on Twitter were *never* going to make the jump to Mastodon, but the majority of them already have Instagram accounts, which puts them a click away from Threads. I expect to see a lot of them there fairly soon. If you're also there, [say hi](https://threads.net/@zioibi)!\n\n[^1]: Please note, these are not real services (yet),¬†as far as I know.\n",

Herne Bay (only 9km up the road) feels far closer to a traditional English seaside town: greasy spoon cafes, a pier, seagulls making a play for your ice cream cone. \n\n<img src=\"https://adam.micro.blog/uploads/2023/hernez.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"A walkway down towards the Herne Bay seafront, with blue sky above the ocean.\">\n\n\n[^1]:\tOne of the only significant marks against Oxford as a place to live is that it‚Äôs 90km from the ocean, as the crow flies.\n",

If you would like to order the paperback, one great option is Bookshop.org ‚Äî¬†and if you use [this link right here](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/7952/9780571376483) I‚Äôll get a little commission, at no extra cost to you!\n\nAt 546 pages, it‚Äôs the lowest page count for a read-along novel yet, *but* the good folks at Faber have chosen a font size for the paperback that‚Äôs a little on the small side, so I think ‚Äî in terms of word count ‚Äî it‚Äôs probably similar to *Great Circle*, or even Murakami‚Äôs *The Wind-up Bird Chronicle*, which we read together in 2015.\n\nI'll send out an introductory email to subscribers on **Sun 2 Jul**, and the following weekend an email will arrive on **Sun 9 Jul**, discussing the first 91 pages of the novel. We‚Äôll be reading at about that pace for six weeks, wrapping up on **Sun 13 Aug**. \n\nIf you have any comments or questions about any of this, just [drop me a line](mailto:readalong@zioibi.com). üìö\n",

				"title": "Jockstrap @ The Bullingdon",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/ce93c0bc33.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Last night I caught a performance by London-based genre-dismantlers <a href=\"https://jockstrapmusic.com\">Jockstrap</a> at The Bullingdon, on Oxford&rsquo;s Cowley Rd. It&rsquo;s a 400-capacity venue that I&rsquo;ve been to for a few shows, but this was the first time I&rsquo;ve seen it packed. The band&rsquo;s current (sold out) tour, in support of debut album <a href=\"https://album.link/gb/i/1625455552\"><em>I Love You Jennifer B</em></a> (2022), is also taking them as far afield as Australia &amp; Japan ‚Äî¬†a further sign that their frenetic, adventurous sound has struck a nerve.</p>\n<p>The set list was probably about as balanced as Jockstrap can get, pulling from both the softer side of their oeuvre ‚Äî¬†songs like the pretty &amp; sad <a href=\"https://song.link/gb/i/1625456136\">&lsquo;Glasgow&rsquo;</a>, which Georgia Ellery sings and strums largely solo<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> ‚Äî to the down-right unstable (see eg. <a href=\"https://song.link/gb/i/1506237863\">&lsquo;Robert&rsquo;</a>).

				"content_text": "![](/uploads/2023/ce93c0bc33.png)\n\nLast night I caught a performance by London-based genre-dismantlers [Jockstrap](https://jockstrapmusic.com) at The Bullingdon, on Oxford's Cowley Rd. It's a 400-capacity venue that I've been to for a few shows, but this was the first time I've seen it packed. The band's current (sold out) tour, in support of debut album [*I Love You Jennifer B*](https://album.link/gb/i/1625455552) (2022), is also taking them as far afield as Australia & Japan ‚Äî¬†a further sign that their frenetic, adventurous sound has struck a nerve. \n\nThe set list was probably about as balanced as Jockstrap can get, pulling from both the softer side of their oeuvre ‚Äî¬†songs like the pretty & sad ['Glasgow'](https://song.link/gb/i/1625456136), which Georgia Ellery sings and strums largely solo[^1] ‚Äî to the down-right unstable (see eg. ['Robert'](https://song.link/gb/i/1506237863)). Most tracks, however, are some mix of styles: the band shifting restlessly between vibes and valences (ie. the danceable middle third of single 'Concrete Over Water', a song that is otherwise something approaching a ballad). \n\nOne aspect of the sequencing that I really enjoyed, is the way in which following 'Concrete Over Water' (2022) with ['The City'](https://song.link/gb/i/1506237868) (2020) makes the earlier track read as a neat coda to the more recent one. \n\n['Angst'](https://song.link/gb/i/1625455889) is a three-minute song on the album that sounds as though it was recorded as a four-minute song, and then had its last quarter compressed into the track's final ~25 seconds. The effect is similar to that of scrubbing through those final moments of audio, and I would have guessed that it would be achieved live by employing a sample. It was a delight to see Ellery sing it, whilst Taylor Skye pitch-shifted her vocal. \n\nThe whole performance was admirably tight, and you could tell the spell was working: the crowd unfailingly remained silent throughout the quieter moments, and exploded into motion on the high-energy songs. Personal favourite ['Debra'](https://song.link/gb/i/1625455895) felt like it landed particularly well.  \n\nFinally, what a joy it must be to know you've got a bona fide banger like ['50/50'](https://song.link/gb/i/1625456147) in your back pocket to drop as a closer. Even though [the (no budget) official video](https://youtu.be/cd_MFQIh2zE) could have been shot at last night's show, it only goes some way to depicting how much harder the song hits in person.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢</div> \n\nRe-listening to *I Love You Jennifer B* ahead of the show (and again this morning) I'm experiencing a little regret that I didn't find a spot for it on my [end of year top 20](/list2022). It was one of a few records that made a shortlist, but not the final cut. It's testament to Jockstrap that the live show injects even more vitality to these already super-vibrant songs, and has me second guessing myself. \n\n[^1]: she is also the violinist in the Mercury Prize-nominated band [Black Country, New Road](https://blackcountrynewroad.com/), and brought out the violin a couple of times during the set, to add yet another flavour to the mix\n",
