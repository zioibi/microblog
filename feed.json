				"title": "The List 2023",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"intro\">Intro.</h3>\n<p>I’ve been making these lists for more than two decades now, but each time November rolls around and it’s time to start chiseling down the mountain of a year’s releases into a set of twenty, I find myself falling into the same mental trap. I’ve become better at it over time, but I still find that I have to make the conscious effort to remind myself: I’m not trying to make a list of the objectively ‘best’ albums of 2023 — there are plenty of magazines and websites out there pretending that’s possible. My task is to produce a run-down of the twenty records that have brought <em>me</em> the most joy.</p>\n<p>When I remember to think about things that way, the task of constructing the list becomes a little easier. It’s not a question of whether I think album Y is <em>better</em> than album Z: it’s about which made me smile more, hum more, sing more, dance more. So, here they are, the twenty album-length records, released in 2023, which moved me the most.</p>\n<h3 id=\"20-jadu-heart-derealised\">20. Jadu Heart — <em>Derealised</em></h3>\n<p>There’s a lot going on in Jadu Heart’s sound. So much so, that early in my time with it, I had <em>Derealised</em> pigeonholed first as a post-shoegaze record, then as a dream-pop record, before (de)realising that it didn’t really matter which of their influences are strongest on any given track — their sound is their own. What the record has throughout, is a strong sense of core melodies, and a production style that layers hazy tones into the mix to arresting effect. ‘Cocoon’ is a straight-ahead, low-key pop song, where ‘I Shimmer’ is messier (and more clearly in debt to mbv). Never rushed — even at their most attention-demanding (eg. the Strokes-on-benzos push and pull of the aptly-titled ‘Sway’) these are songs that wash over the listener easily, casting their spell subtly. Album highlight ‘Freedom’ is perhaps the sound at its tightest, but even here it’s fuzzy at the edges, and loose in the weave. After the briefest of tours through some of their previous work, it seems this is an outfit still evolving, not content to settle into one sound. However, the songwriting (and mood-setting) here is of a quality that will keep me tuned in to see what’s next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-metallica-72-seasons\">19. Metallica — <em>72 Seasons</em></h3>\n<p>I vividly recall the giddy feeling induced by the arrival of <em>Death Magnetic</em> in 2008: Metallica had finally released another album I truly liked, from start-to-finish, a full 17 years on from having last done so with their 1991 self-titled masterpiece. Subsequently, a less-than-impressive Lou Reed collaboration in 2011 left me cold, as did (the fairly well-received) <em>Hardwired… to Self-Destruct</em> (2016). Which meant, upon the arrival of <em>72 Seasons</em> in April, there was a heavy measure of relief in the mix for me, when the first listen confirmed what I’d dared not count on after three strong pre-released tracks: it was good! Like, really, properly good.</p>\n<p>Eight months on, the bigger surprise is how relatively low the album has placed. There were a few weeks when I was playing the heck out of it, thrilled by its energy (highlight, and career top 30 contender ‘Lux Æterna’) and ambition (11-minute final track ‘Inamorata’). Over time the fire dimmed a little, and I’ve only made the trip through the full 77 minutes a few times in the latter half of the year. When I have, however, there’s still not a weak track to be found, and even if the front half feels stronger, latter highlights ‘Too For Gone?’ and the aforementioned epic closer, are not to be missed.</p>\n<p><em>72 Seasons</em> is, by some measure, the ‘heaviest’ record on this list, and I’m not blind to the fact that nostalgia is playing its part here. I’m confident there were any number of ‘better’ metal records released in 2023, but I’m happy just to have the company of Lars and the boys once more. Even if you can only count on one great Metallica album every decade-and-a-half, it was a joy to have this one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-sebastian-rochford--kit-downes-a-short-diary\">18. Sebastian Rochford &amp; Kit Downes — <em>A Short Diary</em></h3>\n<p>This is a set of delicate compositions for piano and drums, from previous Mercury nominee Kit Downes, and Sons of Kemet member / Polar Bear band-leader Seb Rochford (whom I’ve kept an eye on since <em>Peepers</em> (2010)). On reflection, it feels as though I listened to less jazz in 2023 than has been the case in recent years — the reason, if there is one, eludes me — but there were a small number of records I really enjoyed. This relatively brief collection of sparse, reflective pieces has not only lasted since I first played it in January, it has grown in my mind as I’ve found myself returning to it. Over that time I’ve found my enjoyment increasing alongside my ability to anticipate the melodies’ next step and turn. I’ve read comparisons to Bach and Mahler, the aptness of which lies beyond my ken. I do know that the interplay between the two instruments creates a kind of magic for me, as they find new and surprising ways to complement one another.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A hat tip is owed to Tyshawn Sorey, whose <em>Continuing</em> narrowly misses out on a place here. That record was eagerly anticipated by me, following his appearance in the top 10 of my 2021 list. It dropped mid-year, and I’ve spent far too little time with it up to this point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"17-screaming-females-desire-pathway\">17. Screaming Females — <em>Desire Pathway</em></h3>\n<p>As I write this, the news of Screaming Females breaking up is less than a week old. I’d arrived late to the band, thrilled by 2018’s <em>All At Once</em>, which placed 14th for me that year. Five years on, its no surprise that I was eager to receive another set of super-melodic, fuzzed up, alt rock treats, all carried along by Marissa Paternoster’s sidewinding guitar and singular vocals.</p>\n<p>More than capable of operating across a few different gears — from the call to arms of opener ‘Brass Bell’ to the poppy jaunt of ‘Mourning Dove’, via arms-around-shoulders sing-along ‘Beyond the Void’ — the unifying element here is a well-honed ear for hooks, and a mastery of classic guitar / drums / bass dynamics. Each element enjoys its time to shine, but the delight is in how seamlessly it all fits together to make a sound that feels both familiar, and always welcome.</p>\n<p>In their disbandment announcement, they are rightly proud of the approach they’ve taken over the last 18 years:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We funded and made the records we wanted to make. We did our own art. We printed a lot of our own merch. We managed ourselves. Probably most importantly we loaded up our van with our gear and traveled around the world to play shows wherever you would have us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everything about Screaming Females speaks of people who have music in their blood. I, for one, hope and expect to hear Paternoster’s voice again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-unknown-mortal-orchestra-v\">16. Unknown Mortal Orchestra — <em>V</em></h3>\n<p>By the time I started paying attention to Spoon, with 2014’s <em>They Want My Soul</em>, they’d put out eight records over the course of almost two full decades. When I fell head-over-heels for Low’s <em>Double Negative</em> in 2018, they’d already put in a shift of 24 years and a dozen LPs. All of which is to say that, discovering Unknown Mortal Orchestra on their fifth (arguably sixth?) album, may be illustrative of profound ignorance on my part, but it’s not my worst offence.</p>\n<p><em>V</em> proved to be a lot to digest at once. Whilst by no means overly long, the mood it conjures is such that the record plays for me like a 40 minute orchestral movement. It’s alternative music in a different, perhaps truer, sense: pop that has been shifted somehow into a weirder, more cerebral mode. For me <em>V</em> echoed some of the work of previous list grandee Toro y Moi. The production here is similarly gauzy, and the vocal delivery is akin to Chaz Bear’s languid style. This is easy-sounding music, which I fall easily into letting wash over me, though I’ve learned that closer attention pays dividends. I’m still not sure I’ve entirely grasped everything that’s going on here, but it’s a record that keeps compelling me back to dive deeper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-k-lone-swells\">15. K-Lone — <em>Swells</em></h3>\n<p>K-Lone’s debut, <em>Cape Cira</em>, didn’t quite make my list in 2020, but it was in close contention right up until the end. (If I could put myself back into that mental space, I’d perhaps discover that its power had been diluted by the presence of work that year by Caribou, Georgia, and Four Tet, but who knows?) Here on album number two, the Brighton-based producer has really captured something special: unequal parts dub, synth-pop, and the ‘minimal’ end of house to which I’m so partial.</p>\n<p>The opening of ‘Saws’ is misleading, its discordant vocal sample suggesting we might be in for something more disjointed and more difficult. It’s quickly subsumed in a warm bath of synth chords, with playful notes dancing atop. Perhaps this is intended to accustom the listener to keep their wits about them. The instrumentation remains fairly consistent throughout, with a particularly distinct percussion palette that underpins the whole ride, but that’s not to say the record doesn’t go places. These ten tracks seem to grow and bloom in front of the listener, each moment-to-moment twist a delight to behold. Playing with mournful reversed (?) string samples on ‘Strings’; adding a more prominent vocal on ‘With U’; reaching a dubby zenith on ‘Love Is’… the 46 minutes embrace a lot of different dynamics, and meld them into something captivating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-puma-blue--holy-waters\">14. Puma Blue — <em>Holy Waters</em></h3>\n<p>The overall sonic profile of Puma Blue is unlike anything else I encountered this year. Jacob Allen’s other release of 2023 is a sparse, delicate rendition of Nina Simone’s ‘Twelfth of Never’, which is indicative of a fundamental element of his sound. It’s augmented on <em>Holy Waters</em> by a blend of trip hop-adjacent percussion, haunting synths, and other precisely arranged additions. Allen’s sultry, rich vocal always remains central, and whether he’s pining for an absent love (‘Hounds’) or ruminating on attachment (title track ‘Holy Waters’), it feels as though the instrumentation has been constructed — and given a spacious, dusky mix — so as best to support his poetic lyricism, and his delicate delivery. No small part of my enjoyment is owed to the fact that listening to <em>Holy Waters</em> feels as close as we can get to new material from the late Jeff Buckley.</p>\n<p>There are also frequent jazz touches (eg. when the drums and bass get a little <em>Hail to the Thief</em>, on ‘Too Much, Too Much’), which only contribute further to a singular-sounding record that I found myself returning to repeatedly, ideally on headphones, after the sun had set.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-bully-lucky-for-you\">13. Bully — <em>Lucky For You</em></h3>\n<p>When writing last year&rsquo;s list, I noted the frequency with which artists were incorporating some flavour of shoegaze / dream-pop tone into their work. It&rsquo;s a trend that I&rsquo;ve noticed continuing this year, and nowhere more clearly than on <em>Lucky for You</em>. In the mix here are grungy guitar effects, fuzzed-up bass, and a vocal delivery that calls to my mind Sheryl / Alanis at their most forthright.</p>\n<p>A few records this year fit roughly into this same category. I really enjoyed work by Claud (dreamier?), Blondshell, PONY (poppier?), and Sir Chloe – all were in shortlist contention; the latter could easily have been on the final list. What sets Bully apart for me is the consistently excellent songwriting, and the variety of ways Alicia Bognanno finds to play with the colours on her palate. The driving, bouncing &lsquo;Days Move Slow&rsquo;, followed by the more contemplative &lsquo;A Wonderful Life&rsquo; is but one of several mode shifts that land like marvellous one-two punches. To my mind, the record&rsquo;s strongest song (amongst many contenders) is the earnest &lsquo;How Will I Know&rsquo;, with its heartfelt plea of a chorus. It&rsquo;s unlikely to have been at all intentional, but it quickly became entangled in my mind with Olivier Assayas&rsquo;s movie <em>Personal Shopper</em> (2016), which I love beyond reason.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-illiterate-light-sunburned\">12. Illiterate Light — <em>Sunburned</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s a record I discovered quite early on in the year, and which was one of the first 2023 releases to make an impression. Illiterate Light’s sound reminded me a little of the likes of Screaming Trees: attuned perfectly to a particular wavelength of alt-rock, cut with Americana. The production on <em>Sunburned</em> also employs some tricks (such as applying the faintest echo to Jeff Gorman’s vocal) that result in the record sounding expansive and encompassing. It was only after a fair few listens that I discovered that Illiterate Light is only a two-piece! Shortly thereafter, I watched some live performance videos, bewitched by Jake Cochran’s use of a standing drum kit; stunned by Gorman playing synth with his feet, whilst also handling vocal and guitar duties.</p>\n<p>It’s tempting to attribute the album’s tight execution, and very definite sense of a sound, to it being the product of only two people working in harmony. Whether or not that’s true, the result is a set of richly melodic compositions, shot through with an emotional weariness that occasionally gives way to moments of cathartic brightness. ‘Wake Up Now’ is a bombastic start, uncharacteristic in its general positivity; it presages stories of loss, relationship struggle, and paranoia, all expertly rendered, if a little gloomy. For my money, things go a little too far on the album’s only weak moment: penultimate track ‘Fuck LA’, which feels too slight and half-hearted, particularly compared to the colossal ‘Light Me Up’, or the personal-feeling ‘Hellraiser’.</p>\n<p>NB. later in the year, the band released a four-track EP which is also great, but which plays with some much brighter moods on the tracks not titled ‘Cheap Divorce’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-chris-farren-doom-singer\">11. Chris Farren — <em>Doom Singer</em></h3>\n<p>The loudest, sweatiest, most raucous gig I attended in 2023 was to watch Chris Farren (and, new addition to the touring outfit, drummer Frankie) tear apart a tiny room upstairs in an Oxford pub. The tour was in support of his fifth solo album, but he’s also a veteran of other outfits: Fake Problems, and Antarctigo Vespucci. I’m somewhat ashamed to say that I had no familiarity with any of those earlier records when I hit play on <em>Doom Singer</em> back in August. Since then it’s been in consistent rotation, its mix of poppy hooks, grungy riffs, and tongue-in-cheek lyrics an absolute delight from explosive start (‘Bluish’) to melancholy finish (‘Statue Song’). Farren’s sound captures all the melodicism I love in bands like Jimmy Eat World, and transmutes their earnestness with a playful sense of humour, without undercutting the emotional weight. Each three-minute dose of wit and verve is a delight to sing along to, with a wry smile on your face. Album highlight ‘Cosmic Leash’ stretches both the emotive and sonic range a little further, to wonderful effect.</p>\n<p>I’ve dipped into more of Farren’s output since <em>Doom Singer</em> grabbed my attention, and it’s clear there’s a lot more where this came from. I’ll certainly be paying attention from now on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-olivia-dean-messy\">10. Olivia Dean — <em>Messy</em></h3>\n<p>I think I first encountered Olivia Dean’s name amongst the nominees for this year’s Mercury Prize. By the time the award show itself rolled around, I would have given the statuette to her (even over Jockstrap’s <em>I Love You Jennifer B</em>, which I still rue leaving off last year’s list). <em>Messy</em> — inaptly titled by a perfectionist — is a record that feels so well put together, and of such consistent quality, that a few months into my relationship with it, I started to find it difficult to believe I hadn’t known some of these songs (the playful big band flirtation ‘Dive’; the sultry ‘The Ladies Room’) for years. And, the list continues: the immaculately polished R&amp;B of ‘The Hardest Part’; the sweet, coy poetry of ‘I Could Be a Florist’; the delightful family history of closer ‘Carmen’ – each showcases a talent for affecting lyricism, and a singer fully in command of their instrument: a little Lauren Hill, and a little Amy Winehouse.</p>\n<p>Last year this same niche was filled for me by Amber Mark’s excellent <em>Three Dimensions Deep</em>, and whilst I don’t find that I chime with a great deal of modern, mainstream R&amp;B / soul, I deeply appreciate having had these records over the last couple of years, as a refuge of uncomplicated comfort. <em>Messy</em> has a warm and inviting aura that I reached for on several occasions, out of a desire simply to be close to that quality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-andrea--due-in-color\">9. Andrea — <em>Due in Color</em></h3>\n<p>Mononymous Italian producer Andrea has been putting out work on the Zenker brothers’ label Ilian Tape for a decade, and whilst the name has crossed my awareness over the years, debut album <em>Ritorno</em> (2020) isn’t one that I remember playing. My first encounter with <em>Due In Colour</em>, however, came with a strong recommendation, and it does not disappoint. A melange of muted club beats, jazz-adjacent percussion, and washed out production, makes every minute of this record’s hour-plus runtime a mesmerising journey. Each composition flows one into the next, as the hazy instrumentation is carried through a range of tempos, from lounge chair to dance floor.</p>\n<p>I feel like I go looking for an album roughly in this space each year, and since I was tipped to <em>Due in Color</em> back in March, it has remained a go-to record for me whenever I’ve been in the mood. Only time will tell whether it wears as well for me as the very best examples of its kind, such as Shigeto’s <em>No Better Time Than Now</em> (17th in 2013), which I still play regularly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-buck-65-super-dope\">8. Buck 65 — <em>Super Dope</em></h3>\n<p>I almost don’t need to write this entry. The one and only Legendary Buck 65 took second place on last year’s list, with his first album in seven years. As though surprising himself that he still had all this in him, he’s followed up in 2023 with not one, or two, but three records. One, a collaborative effort with Doseone and Jel, 25 years in the making. The other two, essentially straight-up sequels to last year’s <em>King of Drums</em>. Both May’s <em>Super Dope</em> and November’s <em>Punk Rock B-Boy</em> are cut from the same cloth as 2022’s glorious reemergence: immaculately constructed beats, and rhymes as clever and convoluted as they are goofily self-aware. Add in frequent, increasingly niche baseball shout outs, and it sometimes feels like these records are being made especially for me.</p>\n<p>I’m listing <em>Super Dope</em> here because, at this point, I know it better. My suspicion is that, when I find more time to spend with the newer record, I’ll enjoy it just as much. These are albums with a lot to unpack, and it’s been my experience that they only grow on me over time. The same is true of my favourite of Buck’s 90s &amp; 00s output, but — if asked to choose — I might say we’re currently in his best era. I’ll take as many of these as he wants to put out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-cut-worms--cut-worms\">7. Cut Worms — <em>Cut Worms</em></h3>\n<p>This self-titled release is Max Clarke’s third album as Cut Worms, and was a revelation to me when I happened upon it this summer. Despite sounding like a blend of Bright Eyes-esque folk, classic 60s rock n’ roll, and a strong dose of Americana, everything about this felt fresh and vital to me the first time I heard it, and 34 minutes later I found myself playing it again. The record’s balance of easygoing melody, simple constructions, and personal lyrics shot through with melancholy, feels earnest and honest, despite the sound’s affectations. It’s an album that invites you to share in the warmth of its lo-fi production, and to tap your foot to its relaxed pace. Each three minute track has the feel of having been discovered on some long-lost 7-inch, and polished to glowing life.</p>\n<p>There’s something enormously endearing about both the world that Clarke’s songs conjure, and the way in which he’s delivering it. Though musically very different, it’s a spell that has similar effect to those early White Stripes records that I fell for two decades ago.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When it comes to sequencing this list each year, there’s usually a clear demarcating line between the very tip top, cream of the cream records, and a larger group that are all great, and deserving of a place, but which don’t shine quite so scorchingly bright. I loved my time with all fourteen records listed thus far, but the margins are thin between them, and between a dozen more records just over the horizon of a top 20. For me, there were half a dozen albums this year that were truly a cut above, and which I anticipate playing for years to come. Welcome to the top six.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"6-boygenius--the-record\">6. boygenius — <em>the record</em></h3>\n<p>Phoebe Bridgers' <em>Punisher</em> placed 17th on my 2020 list, and has had more staying power than at least five of the records that ranked above it. Lucy Dacus&rsquo;s <em>Historian</em> was in contention for a spot in 2018, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed her solo output since. I also enjoyed Julien Baker&rsquo;s 2021 LP <em>Little Oblivions</em>, but of the trio that comprise boygenius, she was perhaps the least well known to me. It quickly became clear on a couple of listens, however, that boygenius is a true gestalt: the sum greater than the parts.</p>\n<p>Opening <em>a capella</em> number ‘Without You Without Them’ might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly an effective showcase of how well the three voices harmonise. And such is the joy of <em>the record</em>: the lyrics (hip, knowing, sometimes resigned, often open-hearted), and the simple, spacious compositions, are certainly full of charm, but its the melding of three different voices and sensibilities into a magical whole, which truly magnetises. Fragility and strength ebb and flow throughout the album, both in terms of message and delivery. The (post-<em>a capella</em>) introductory trilogy of ‘$20’, ‘Emily I’m Sorry’, &amp; ‘True Blue’ (complete with interlinked videos (directed by Kristen Stewart)) is a microcosm of the set as a whole. As the three voices take it in turns supporting one another in telling personal stories in verse, you get the distinct feeling that this is a folk record in disguise. Even at its rockiest (‘Satanist’) its defining characteristic is raw emotionality. As heart-swollen and touching as anything from the era of peak Saddle Creek, these were songs I returned to countless times since the LP’s arrival in March, basking in increased familiarity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-priya-ragu--santhosam\">5. Priya Ragu — <em>Santhosam</em></h3>\n<p>Priya was one of the most welcome surprises of 2021, taking third place on my list that year with her debut LP <em>damnshestamil</em>. There are cuts on there so well-honed and perfectly polished (&lsquo;Leaf High&rsquo;, &lsquo;Good Love 2.0&rsquo;, &amp; &lsquo;Chicken Lemon Rice&rsquo; amongst them) that I&rsquo;ll admit to a <em>soupçon</em> of doubt that another record would yield comparable results. There have been plenty of artists over the years, who have thrilled with their first offering, and then proven incapable of following up. Perhaps unfairly, the first to mind is La Roux: an exemplary debut in 2009, the quality of which hasn&rsquo;t been close to matched by anything on the subsequent two albums in the 14 years since.</p>\n<p>Well, no such problem for Priya Ragu, who has filled <em>Santhosam</em> with fine examples of her unique blend of soul / hip-hop / R&amp;B and influences from her Sri Lankan-Tamil / Swiss upbringing. I still hear a little Janet (Miss Jackson if you&rsquo;re nasty) in the ease with which Priya does it, but truly this sound is entirely its own thing. Its infectious warmth and colour characterises track-after-track of immaculately danceable, smile-along pop. Even when tackling more difficult subject matter — such as racist policing on &lsquo;Black Goose&rsquo; — there&rsquo;s an undertone of communal understanding and unity. If proof were needed that Ragu is the real thing, it&rsquo;s in no short supply here. I&rsquo;m still listening to the debut with some regularity, and I also anticipate playing this for years to come.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-paramore--this-is-why\">4. Paramore — <em>This Is Why</em></h3>\n<p>Of Paramore’s previous output, <em>Brand New Eyes</em> is the previous high-water mark: 8th in 2009. Their self-titled record reached 12th in 2013, and <em>After Laughter</em> hit 10th in 2017. Obviously all of that is contextual, which perhaps explains why — ranked against one another — they would fall in an order other than that suggested by their relative competitiveness in their respective end-of-year running. We should also note front woman Hayley Williams’s solo work: <em>Petals for Armour</em> broke the top five on my 2020 list, before follow-up <em>Flowers for Vases / Descansos</em> failed to place the following year. All of this makes a kind of sense, if you can hold it all in your head at the same time. The folkier, sparser arrangements of the latter solo record didn’t work for me in the same way that the combination of Williams’s voice, artful lyric, and ear for a pop-rock hook have across other contexts. What’s more, at the close of 2023, I count myself as probably more of a Paramore fan than I have been at any point in the past. Looping <em>This Is Why</em> for weeks after its February release predictably led to some level of burnout. That led, in turn, to a revisiting of their previous work, which — despite the fact that I already knew it well — deepened my admiration for their dynamic, ambitious brand of pop-punk-dance-rock.</p>\n<p><em>This Is Why</em> stands as perhaps the apotheosis of their style. It’s Paramore’s best record, and a showcase to the most mature version of their sound. The opener and title track is all groovy bass and slinky vocal, at least until its chant of a chorus; ‘The News’ is more jagged and motivated; ‘Running Out of Time’ is more narrowly focussed, but no less enthused. My personal favourite, since my early days with the album, has been ‘You First’, a synth-infused run up and down the gears that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Metric release.</p>\n<p>The six years between releases — and Williams’ solo output — had me questioning whether Paramore were in fact on some kind of unannounced / unofficial hiatus. It’s been a pleasure to revel not only in their return, but in their having reached new heights.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-romy--mid-air\">3. Romy — <em>Mid Air</em></h3>\n<p>When, at the very beginning of opener &lsquo;Loveher&rsquo;, Romy Madley Croft softly intones a request to &ldquo;turn it up a bit more&rdquo;, I almost invariably comply. <em>Mid Air</em> is an album I want to be surrounded by and enveloped in, and a little additional volume helps cast the spell. Another vital ingredient is Croft&rsquo;s soft, sweet vocal, of which I&rsquo;ve always been a fan: The xx&rsquo;s <em>Coexist</em> placed 20th in 2012; <em>I See You</em>, 16th in 2017. Add in lyrics that tell personal and true-feeling stories about queer love and mental health, all suffused with a pleasing optimism. And on top of that, there&rsquo;s the production, which takes Fred Again..&rsquo;s (sic) intimate, soft-touch style and (for this listener) elevates it into a poppier mode.</p>\n<p>From &lsquo;Loveher&rsquo; through to closer &lsquo;She&rsquo;s On My Mind&rsquo;, <em>Mid Air</em> quickly felt very much as though it had been conceived as an album, as opposed to discrete songs. Both the mood, and the unfolding romantic narrative feel like a single journey, though one with identifiable landmarks. &lsquo;The Sea&rsquo; is coy and meandering; &lsquo;Strong&rsquo; is the big beat peak; &lsquo;Did I&rsquo; dims the lights; late album highlight &lsquo;Enjoy Your Life&rsquo; is an unimpeachable dance anthem.</p>\n<p>With this release, Romy eclipses her xx band mate Jamie xx&rsquo;s 8th place on my 2015 list, for his solo debut <em>In Colour</em>. At this point, I&rsquo;m impatiently awaiting another xx LP, and also more solo work from – with apologies to Oliver Sim, whose own solo record, <em>Hideous Bastard</em>, didn&rsquo;t entirely work for me last year – two of its members. If I could only have one though, at this point I&rsquo;d choose Romy in a heartbeat. No record felt more like an embrace this year than <em>Mid Air</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-metric--formentera-ii\">2. Metric — <em>Formentera II</em></h3>\n<p>When it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. It’s more common in hip-hop (see eg. Jay-Z’s <em>In My Lifetime</em> vols. 1-3 &amp; <em>The Blueprint</em> 1-3), but if a rock band is going to release multiple albums’ worth of material under one title, it usually comes in the form of a double-album: classics of the genre include The Beatles’ <em>The Beatles</em> (1968), Fleetwood Mac’s <em>Tusk</em> (1979), and Nine Inch Nails’ <em>The Fragile</em> (1999).</p>\n<p>There are confusing outliers, such as Smashing Pumpkins’ insistence on giving certain releases a subtitle or volume number, which series potentially never to be added to. Guns n Roses’ threw a curveball in 1991 with the tandem releases of <em>Use Your Illusion</em> volumes I &amp; II — essentially a double album, though you had to purchase both halves separately. All of which gave rise to conflicted feelings for me, when Metric announced that their 2022 masterpiece <em>Formentera</em> would get a direct continuation.</p>\n<p>One cause for concern was the extent to which the situation seemed to echo Biffy Clyro having released <em>A Celebration of Endings</em> (14th for me in 2020), and then finding they had another album’s worth of material almost immediately. <em>The Myth of the Happily Ever After</em> (2021) was enjoyable enough, but did not place for me. Perhaps a more optimistic allegory would be Radiohead’s unfairly maligned <em>Amnesiac</em> (2001), certainly lesser than its immediate precursor, <em>Kid A</em> (2000), but a wonderful record in its own right. Was that a reasonable expectation?</p>\n<p>You will recall, of course, that <em>Formentera</em> was my favourite album of last year, and at twelve months’ remove, I remain happy with that assessment. My end-of-2023 Apple Music rundown informs me that I have played no artist more frequently in this year than Metric, and it’s not exactly what might be considered close. The band also performed my favourite live show of the year: a couple of hours of synth-rock bliss at Camden’s Roundhouse, back in February.</p>\n<p><em>Formentera II</em> itself very much continues the pandemic angst and desire for escapism that characterised the original record. Highlights include the ultra-catchy ‘Days of Oblivion’, the semi-autobiographical ‘Who Would You Be For Me’, and the teasing ‘Suckers’, which threatens to break out of itself at any moment. ‘Descendants’ feels like a closer, echoing some of the sentiments of epic <em>Formentera</em> opener ‘Doomscroller’, before actual closer ‘Go Ahead and Cry’ heralds the (false?) dawn of a new day, as we collectively awake from the fugue that Metric have so masterfully chronicled.</p>\n<p>Happily, I needn’t have worried when Metric stood back from the near flawless <em>Formentera</em>, and asked “want to see us do it again?” Lesson learned: the answer to that question, from this band, should always be yes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-olivia-rodrigo-guts\">1. Olivia Rodrigo — <em>GUTS</em></h3>\n<p>When it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. When last we heard from Olivia, she was heartbroken and frustrated in the aftermath of a relationship gone — pun intended — <em>SOUR</em> (2021). Two years later, Rodrigo’s latest dispatch is another hymn book full of remarkable pop-rock gems, this time squarely aimed at the trials and tribulations of young adulthood. The heat and glare of the spotlight on someone in her position is almost unfathomably oppressive to the average person, and yet Rodrigo not only handles it with grace, she finds the words to elucidate her situation in a manner that renders it relatable. Too quickly pigeonholed as a pop phenomenon, Olivia is a wildly underrated lyricist. Opener ‘all-american bitch’ is (like many of her songs) a bombastic, ultra-self-aware jam — in this case on the precarity and impossibility of modern womanhood. Taken alongside tracks like ‘making the bed’ and closer ‘teenage dream’, the listener bears witness to a supremely talented songwriter wrestling with expectation, fame, and the ephemerality of youth.</p>\n<p>All of that sounds quite heavy, which is misleading, because <em>GUTS</em> is also home to the same infectious, effervescent <em>joie de vivre</em> that characterised <em>SOUR</em>. There was no more self-effacingly goofy song this year than ‘ballad of a homeschooled girl’, unless it was ‘love is embarrassing’. And then there’s lead single (and my favourite song of 2023), ‘vampire’: a masterclass in song construction that fits the highs and lows of a riveting emotional journey into little more than three minutes.</p>\n<p>I hit <em>GUTS</em> so hard when it released in September, that I had to force myself into taking a break. As a substitute, I found myself regularly playing Cyndi Lauper’s <em>She’s So Unusual</em> (1983), a now 40 year old pop landmark that carries its message across four decades as clearly as a bell. That’s the company in which I place Olivia Rodrigo, even at this early point in her career. I hope she’s around for decades to come, explaining the world and the heart through the medium of perfect pop music.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n### Intro.\n\nI’ve been making these lists for more than two decades now, but each time November rolls around and it’s time to start chiseling down the mountain of a year’s releases into a set of twenty, I find myself falling into the same mental trap. I’ve become better at it over time, but I still find that I have to make the conscious effort to remind myself: I’m not trying to make a list of the objectively ‘best’ albums of 2023 — there are plenty of magazines and websites out there pretending that’s possible. My task is to produce a run-down of the twenty records that have brought *me* the most joy.\n\t\nWhen I remember to think about things that way, the task of constructing the list becomes a little easier. It’s not a question of whether I think album Y is *better* than album Z: it’s about which made me smile more, hum more, sing more, dance more. So, here they are, the twenty album-length records, released in 2023, which moved me the most. \n\n### 20. Jadu Heart — *Derealised*\n\nThere’s a lot going on in Jadu Heart’s sound. So much so, that early in my time with it, I had *Derealised* pigeonholed first as a post-shoegaze record, then as a dream-pop record, before (de)realising that it didn’t really matter which of their influences are strongest on any given track — their sound is their own. What the record has throughout, is a strong sense of core melodies, and a production style that layers hazy tones into the mix to arresting effect. ‘Cocoon’ is a straight-ahead, low-key pop song, where ‘I Shimmer’ is messier (and more clearly in debt to mbv). Never rushed — even at their most attention-demanding (eg. the Strokes-on-benzos push and pull of the aptly-titled ‘Sway’) these are songs that wash over the listener easily, casting their spell subtly. Album highlight ‘Freedom’ is perhaps the sound at its tightest, but even here it’s fuzzy at the edges, and loose in the weave. After the briefest of tours through some of their previous work, it seems this is an outfit still evolving, not content to settle into one sound. However, the songwriting (and mood-setting) here is of a quality that will keep me tuned in to see what’s next. \n\n### 19. Metallica — *72 Seasons*\n\nI vividly recall the giddy feeling induced by the arrival of *Death Magnetic* in 2008: Metallica had finally released another album I truly liked, from start-to-finish, a full 17 years on from having last done so with their 1991 self-titled masterpiece. Subsequently, a less-than-impressive Lou Reed collaboration in 2011 left me cold, as did (the fairly well-received) *Hardwired… to Self-Destruct* (2016). Which meant, upon the arrival of *72 Seasons* in April, there was a heavy measure of relief in the mix for me, when the first listen confirmed what I’d dared not count on after three strong pre-released tracks: it was good! Like, really, properly good.\n\t\nEight months on, the bigger surprise is how relatively low the album has placed. There were a few weeks when I was playing the heck out of it, thrilled by its energy (highlight, and career top 30 contender ‘Lux Æterna’) and ambition (11-minute final track ‘Inamorata’). Over time the fire dimmed a little, and I’ve only made the trip through the full 77 minutes a few times in the latter half of the year. When I have, however, there’s still not a weak track to be found, and even if the front half feels stronger, latter highlights ‘Too For Gone?’ and the aforementioned epic closer, are not to be missed. \n\t\n*72 Seasons* is, by some measure, the ‘heaviest’ record on this list, and I’m not blind to the fact that nostalgia is playing its part here. I’m confident there were any number of ‘better’ metal records released in 2023, but I’m happy just to have the company of Lars and the boys once more. Even if you can only count on one great Metallica album every decade-and-a-half, it was a joy to have this one. \n\n### 18. Sebastian Rochford & Kit Downes — *A Short Diary*\n\nThis is a set of delicate compositions for piano and drums, from previous Mercury nominee Kit Downes, and Sons of Kemet member / Polar Bear band-leader Seb Rochford (whom I’ve kept an eye on since *Peepers* (2010)). On reflection, it feels as though I listened to less jazz in 2023 than has been the case in recent years — the reason, if there is one, eludes me — but there were a small number of records I really enjoyed. This relatively brief collection of sparse, reflective pieces has not only lasted since I first played it in January, it has grown in my mind as I’ve found myself returning to it. Over that time I’ve found my enjoyment increasing alongside my ability to anticipate the melodies’ next step and turn. I’ve read comparisons to Bach and Mahler, the aptness of which lies beyond my ken. I do know that the interplay between the two instruments creates a kind of magic for me, as they find new and surprising ways to complement one another. \n\t\n<font color=\"#cfcfcf\">A hat tip is owed to Tyshawn Sorey, whose *Continuing* narrowly misses out on a place here. That record was eagerly anticipated by me, following his appearance in the top 10 of my 2021 list. It dropped mid-year, and I’ve spent far too little time with it up to this point.</font> \n\n### 17. Screaming Females — *Desire Pathway*\n\nAs I write this, the news of Screaming Females breaking up is less than a week old. I’d arrived late to the band, thrilled by 2018’s *All At Once*, which placed 14th for me that year. Five years on, its no surprise that I was eager to receive another set of super-melodic, fuzzed up, alt rock treats, all carried along by Marissa Paternoster’s sidewinding guitar and singular vocals.\n\t\nMore than capable of operating across a few different gears — from the call to arms of opener ‘Brass Bell’ to the poppy jaunt of ‘Mourning Dove’, via arms-around-shoulders sing-along ‘Beyond the Void’ — the unifying element here is a well-honed ear for hooks, and a mastery of classic guitar / drums / bass dynamics. Each element enjoys its time to shine, but the delight is in how seamlessly it all fits together to make a sound that feels both familiar, and always welcome. \n\t\nIn their disbandment announcement, they are rightly proud of the approach they’ve taken over the last 18 years: \n\t\n> We funded and made the records we wanted to make. We did our own art. We printed a lot of our own merch. We managed ourselves. Probably most importantly we loaded up our van with our gear and traveled around the world to play shows wherever you would have us.\n\t\nEverything about Screaming Females speaks of people who have music in their blood. I, for one, hope and expect to hear Paternoster’s voice again. \n\n### 16. Unknown Mortal Orchestra — *V*\n\nBy the time I started paying attention to Spoon, with 2014’s *They Want My Soul*, they’d put out eight records over the course of almost two full decades. When I fell head-over-heels for Low’s *Double Negative* in 2018, they’d already put in a shift of 24 years and a dozen LPs. All of which is to say that, discovering Unknown Mortal Orchestra on their fifth (arguably sixth?) album, may be illustrative of profound ignorance on my part, but it’s not my worst offence. \n\n*V* proved to be a lot to digest at once. Whilst by no means overly long, the mood it conjures is such that the record plays for me like a 40 minute orchestral movement. It’s alternative music in a different, perhaps truer, sense: pop that has been shifted somehow into a weirder, more cerebral mode. For me *V* echoed some of the work of previous list grandee Toro y Moi. The production here is similarly gauzy, and the vocal delivery is akin to Chaz Bear’s languid style. This is easy-sounding music, which I fall easily into letting wash over me, though I’ve learned that closer attention pays dividends. I’m still not sure I’ve entirely grasped everything that’s going on here, but it’s a record that keeps compelling me back to dive deeper.\n\t\n### 15. K-Lone — *Swells*\n\nK-Lone’s debut, *Cape Cira*, didn’t quite make my list in 2020, but it was in close contention right up until the end. (If I could put myself back into that mental space, I’d perhaps discover that its power had been diluted by the presence of work that year by Caribou, Georgia, and Four Tet, but who knows?) Here on album number two, the Brighton-based producer has really captured something special: unequal parts dub, synth-pop, and the ‘minimal’ end of house to which I’m so partial. \n\t\nThe opening of ‘Saws’ is misleading, its discordant vocal sample suggesting we might be in for something more disjointed and more difficult. It’s quickly subsumed in a warm bath of synth chords, with playful notes dancing atop. Perhaps this is intended to accustom the listener to keep their wits about them. The instrumentation remains fairly consistent throughout, with a particularly distinct percussion palette that underpins the whole ride, but that’s not to say the record doesn’t go places. These ten tracks seem to grow and bloom in front of the listener, each moment-to-moment twist a delight to behold. Playing with mournful reversed (?) string samples on ‘Strings’; adding a more prominent vocal on ‘With U’; reaching a dubby zenith on ‘Love Is’… the 46 minutes embrace a lot of different dynamics, and meld them into something captivating. \n\n### 14. Puma Blue — *Holy Waters*\n\nThe overall sonic profile of Puma Blue is unlike anything else I encountered this year. Jacob Allen’s other release of 2023 is a sparse, delicate rendition of Nina Simone’s ‘Twelfth of Never’, which is indicative of a fundamental element of his sound. It’s augmented on *Holy Waters* by a blend of trip hop-adjacent percussion, haunting synths, and other precisely arranged additions. Allen’s sultry, rich vocal always remains central, and whether he’s pining for an absent love (‘Hounds’) or ruminating on attachment (title track ‘Holy Waters’), it feels as though the instrumentation has been constructed — and given a spacious, dusky mix — so as best to support his poetic lyricism, and his delicate delivery. No small part of my enjoyment is owed to the fact that listening to *Holy Waters* feels as close as we can get to new material from the late Jeff Buckley. \n\t\nThere are also frequent jazz touches (eg. when the drums and bass get a little *Hail to the Thief*, on ‘Too Much, Too Much’), which only contribute further to a singular-sounding record that I found myself returning to repeatedly, ideally on headphones, after the sun had set. \n\n### 13. Bully — *Lucky For You*\n\nWhen writing last year's list, I noted the frequency with which artists were incorporating some flavour of shoegaze / dream-pop tone into their work. It's a trend that I've noticed continuing this year, and nowhere more clearly than on *Lucky for You*. In the mix here are grungy guitar effects, fuzzed-up bass, and a vocal delivery that calls to my mind Sheryl / Alanis at their most forthright.\n\t\nA few records this year fit roughly into this same category. I really enjoyed work by Claud (dreamier?), Blondshell, PONY (poppier?), and Sir Chloe – all were in shortlist contention; the latter could easily have been on the final list. What sets Bully apart for me is the consistently excellent songwriting, and the variety of ways Alicia Bognanno finds to play with the colours on her palate. The driving, bouncing 'Days Move Slow', followed by the more contemplative 'A Wonderful Life' is but one of several mode shifts that land like marvellous one-two punches. To my mind, the record's strongest song (amongst many contenders) is the earnest 'How Will I Know', with its heartfelt plea of a chorus. It's unlikely to have been at all intentional, but it quickly became entangled in my mind with Olivier Assayas's movie *Personal Shopper* (2016), which I love beyond reason.\n\n### 12. Illiterate Light — *Sunburned*\n\nHere’s a record I discovered quite early on in the year, and which was one of the first 2023 releases to make an impression. Illiterate Light’s sound reminded me a little of the likes of Screaming Trees: attuned perfectly to a particular wavelength of alt-rock, cut with Americana. The production on *Sunburned* also employs some tricks (such as applying the faintest echo to Jeff Gorman’s vocal) that result in the record sounding expansive and encompassing. It was only after a fair few listens that I discovered that Illiterate Light is only a two-piece! Shortly thereafter, I watched some live performance videos, bewitched by Jake Cochran’s use of a standing drum kit; stunned by Gorman playing synth with his feet, whilst also handling vocal and guitar duties. \n\t\nIt’s tempting to attribute the album’s tight execution, and very definite sense of a sound, to it being the product of only two people working in harmony. Whether or not that’s true, the result is a set of richly melodic compositions, shot through with an emotional weariness that occasionally gives way to moments of cathartic brightness. ‘Wake Up Now’ is a bombastic start, uncharacteristic in its general positivity; it presages stories of loss, relationship struggle, and paranoia, all expertly rendered, if a little gloomy. For my money, things go a little too far on the album’s only weak moment: penultimate track ‘Fuck LA’, which feels too slight and half-hearted, particularly compared to the colossal ‘Light Me Up’, or the personal-feeling ‘Hellraiser’.\n\t\nNB. later in the year, the band released a four-track EP which is also great, but which plays with some much brighter moods on the tracks not titled ‘Cheap Divorce’. \n\n### 11. Chris Farren — *Doom Singer*\n\nThe loudest, sweatiest, most raucous gig I attended in 2023 was to watch Chris Farren (and, new addition to the touring outfit, drummer Frankie) tear apart a tiny room upstairs in an Oxford pub. The tour was in support of his fifth solo album, but he’s also a veteran of other outfits: Fake Problems, and Antarctigo Vespucci. I’m somewhat ashamed to say that I had no familiarity with any of those earlier records when I hit play on *Doom Singer* back in August. Since then it’s been in consistent rotation, its mix of poppy hooks, grungy riffs, and tongue-in-cheek lyrics an absolute delight from explosive start (‘Bluish’) to melancholy finish (‘Statue Song’). Farren’s sound captures all the melodicism I love in bands like Jimmy Eat World, and transmutes their earnestness with a playful sense of humour, without undercutting the emotional weight. Each three-minute dose of wit and verve is a delight to sing along to, with a wry smile on your face. Album highlight ‘Cosmic Leash’ stretches both the emotive and sonic range a little further, to wonderful effect. \n\t\nI’ve dipped into more of Farren’s output since *Doom Singer* grabbed my attention, and it’s clear there’s a lot more where this came from. I’ll certainly be paying attention from now on.  \n\n### 10. Olivia Dean — *Messy*\n\nI think I first encountered Olivia Dean’s name amongst the nominees for this year’s Mercury Prize. By the time the award show itself rolled around, I would have given the statuette to her (even over Jockstrap’s *I Love You Jennifer B*, which I still rue leaving off last year’s list). *Messy* — inaptly titled by a perfectionist — is a record that feels so well put together, and of such consistent quality, that a few months into my relationship with it, I started to find it difficult to believe I hadn’t known some of these songs (the playful big band flirtation ‘Dive’; the sultry ‘The Ladies Room’) for years. And, the list continues: the immaculately polished R&B of ‘The Hardest Part’; the sweet, coy poetry of ‘I Could Be a Florist’; the delightful family history of closer ‘Carmen’ – each showcases a talent for affecting lyricism, and a singer fully in command of their instrument: a little Lauren Hill, and a little Amy Winehouse. \n\t\nLast year this same niche was filled for me by Amber Mark’s excellent *Three Dimensions Deep*, and whilst I don’t find that I chime with a great deal of modern, mainstream R&B / soul, I deeply appreciate having had these records over the last couple of years, as a refuge of uncomplicated comfort. *Messy* has a warm and inviting aura that I reached for on several occasions, out of a desire simply to be close to that quality. \n\n### 9. Andrea — *Due in Color*\n\nMononymous Italian producer Andrea has been putting out work on the Zenker brothers’ label Ilian Tape for a decade, and whilst the name has crossed my awareness over the years, debut album *Ritorno* (2020) isn’t one that I remember playing. My first encounter with *Due In Colour*, however, came with a strong recommendation, and it does not disappoint. A melange of muted club beats, jazz-adjacent percussion, and washed out production, makes every minute of this record’s hour-plus runtime a mesmerising journey. Each composition flows one into the next, as the hazy instrumentation is carried through a range of tempos, from lounge chair to dance floor. \n\t\nI feel like I go looking for an album roughly in this space each year, and since I was tipped to *Due in Color* back in March, it has remained a go-to record for me whenever I’ve been in the mood. Only time will tell whether it wears as well for me as the very best examples of its kind, such as Shigeto’s *No Better Time Than Now* (17th in 2013), which I still play regularly. \n\n### 8. Buck 65 — *Super Dope*\n\nI almost don’t need to write this entry. The one and only Legendary Buck 65 took second place on last year’s list, with his first album in seven years. As though surprising himself that he still had all this in him, he’s followed up in 2023 with not one, or two, but three records. One, a collaborative effort with Doseone and Jel, 25 years in the making. The other two, essentially straight-up sequels to last year’s *King of Drums*. Both May’s *Super Dope* and November’s *Punk Rock B-Boy* are cut from the same cloth as 2022’s glorious reemergence: immaculately constructed beats, and rhymes as clever and convoluted as they are goofily self-aware. Add in frequent, increasingly niche baseball shout outs, and it sometimes feels like these records are being made especially for me. \n\t\nI’m listing *Super Dope* here because, at this point, I know it better. My suspicion is that, when I find more time to spend with the newer record, I’ll enjoy it just as much. These are albums with a lot to unpack, and it’s been my experience that they only grow on me over time. The same is true of my favourite of Buck’s 90s & 00s output, but — if asked to choose — I might say we’re currently in his best era. I’ll take as many of these as he wants to put out. \n\n### 7. Cut Worms — *Cut Worms*\n\nThis self-titled release is Max Clarke’s third album as Cut Worms, and was a revelation to me when I happened upon it this summer. Despite sounding like a blend of Bright Eyes-esque folk, classic 60s rock n’ roll, and a strong dose of Americana, everything about this felt fresh and vital to me the first time I heard it, and 34 minutes later I found myself playing it again. The record’s balance of easygoing melody, simple constructions, and personal lyrics shot through with melancholy, feels earnest and honest, despite the sound’s affectations. It’s an album that invites you to share in the warmth of its lo-fi production, and to tap your foot to its relaxed pace. Each three minute track has the feel of having been discovered on some long-lost 7-inch, and polished to glowing life. \n\t\nThere’s something enormously endearing about both the world that Clarke’s songs conjure, and the way in which he’s delivering it. Though musically very different, it’s a spell that has similar effect to those early White Stripes records that I fell for two decades ago.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div>   \n\nWhen it comes to sequencing this list each year, there’s usually a clear demarcating line between the very tip top, cream of the cream records, and a larger group that are all great, and deserving of a place, but which don’t shine quite so scorchingly bright. I loved my time with all fourteen records listed thus far, but the margins are thin between them, and between a dozen more records just over the horizon of a top 20. For me, there were half a dozen albums this year that were truly a cut above, and which I anticipate playing for years to come. Welcome to the top six.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div>   \n\n### 6. boygenius — *the record*\n\nPhoebe Bridgers' *Punisher* placed 17th on my 2020 list, and has had more staying power than at least five of the records that ranked above it. Lucy Dacus's *Historian* was in contention for a spot in 2018, and I've enjoyed her solo output since. I also enjoyed Julien Baker's 2021 LP *Little Oblivions*, but of the trio that comprise boygenius, she was perhaps the least well known to me. It quickly became clear on a couple of listens, however, that boygenius is a true gestalt: the sum greater than the parts. \n\t\nOpening *a capella* number ‘Without You Without Them’ might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly an effective showcase of how well the three voices harmonise. And such is the joy of *the record*: the lyrics (hip, knowing, sometimes resigned, often open-hearted), and the simple, spacious compositions, are certainly full of charm, but its the melding of three different voices and sensibilities into a magical whole, which truly magnetises. Fragility and strength ebb and flow throughout the album, both in terms of message and delivery. The (post-*a capella*) introductory trilogy of ‘$20’, ‘Emily I’m Sorry’, & ‘True Blue’ (complete with interlinked videos (directed by Kristen Stewart)) is a microcosm of the set as a whole. As the three voices take it in turns supporting one another in telling personal stories in verse, you get the distinct feeling that this is a folk record in disguise. Even at its rockiest (‘Satanist’) its defining characteristic is raw emotionality. As heart-swollen and touching as anything from the era of peak Saddle Creek, these were songs I returned to countless times since the LP’s arrival in March, basking in increased familiarity. \n\n### 5. Priya Ragu — *Santhosam*\n\nPriya was one of the most welcome surprises of 2021, taking third place on my list that year with her debut LP *damnshestamil*. There are cuts on there so well-honed and perfectly polished ('Leaf High', 'Good Love 2.0', & 'Chicken Lemon Rice' amongst them) that I'll admit to a *soupçon* of doubt that another record would yield comparable results. There have been plenty of artists over the years, who have thrilled with their first offering, and then proven incapable of following up. Perhaps unfairly, the first to mind is La Roux: an exemplary debut in 2009, the quality of which hasn't been close to matched by anything on the subsequent two albums in the 14 years since.\n\t\nWell, no such problem for Priya Ragu, who has filled *Santhosam* with fine examples of her unique blend of soul / hip-hop / R&B and influences from her Sri Lankan-Tamil / Swiss upbringing. I still hear a little Janet (Miss Jackson if you're nasty) in the ease with which Priya does it, but truly this sound is entirely its own thing. Its infectious warmth and colour characterises track-after-track of immaculately danceable, smile-along pop. Even when tackling more difficult subject matter — such as racist policing on 'Black Goose' — there's an undertone of communal understanding and unity. If proof were needed that Ragu is the real thing, it's in no short supply here. I'm still listening to the debut with some regularity, and I also anticipate playing this for years to come.\n\n### 4. Paramore — *This Is Why*\n\nOf Paramore’s previous output, *Brand New Eyes* is the previous high-water mark: 8th in 2009. Their self-titled record reached 12th in 2013, and *After Laughter* hit 10th in 2017. Obviously all of that is contextual, which perhaps explains why — ranked against one another — they would fall in an order other than that suggested by their relative competitiveness in their respective end-of-year running. We should also note front woman Hayley Williams’s solo work: *Petals for Armour* broke the top five on my 2020 list, before follow-up *Flowers for Vases / Descansos* failed to place the following year. All of this makes a kind of sense, if you can hold it all in your head at the same time. The folkier, sparser arrangements of the latter solo record didn’t work for me in the same way that the combination of Williams’s voice, artful lyric, and ear for a pop-rock hook have across other contexts. What’s more, at the close of 2023, I count myself as probably more of a Paramore fan than I have been at any point in the past. Looping *This Is Why* for weeks after its February release predictably led to some level of burnout. That led, in turn, to a revisiting of their previous work, which — despite the fact that I already knew it well — deepened my admiration for their dynamic, ambitious brand of pop-punk-dance-rock. \n\t\n*This Is Why* stands as perhaps the apotheosis of their style. It’s Paramore’s best record, and a showcase to the most mature version of their sound. The opener and title track is all groovy bass and slinky vocal, at least until its chant of a chorus; ‘The News’ is more jagged and motivated; ‘Running Out of Time’ is more narrowly focussed, but no less enthused. My personal favourite, since my early days with the album, has been ‘You First’, a synth-infused run up and down the gears that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Metric release. \n\t\nThe six years between releases — and Williams’ solo output — had me questioning whether Paramore were in fact on some kind of unannounced / unofficial hiatus. It’s been a pleasure to revel not only in their return, but in their having reached new heights. \n\n### 3. Romy — *Mid Air*\n\nWhen, at the very beginning of opener 'Loveher', Romy Madley Croft softly intones a request to \"turn it up a bit more\", I almost invariably comply. *Mid Air* is an album I want to be surrounded by and enveloped in, and a little additional volume helps cast the spell. Another vital ingredient is Croft's soft, sweet vocal, of which I've always been a fan: The xx's *Coexist* placed 20th in 2012; *I See You*, 16th in 2017. Add in lyrics that tell personal and true-feeling stories about queer love and mental health, all suffused with a pleasing optimism. And on top of that, there's the production, which takes Fred Again..'s (sic) intimate, soft-touch style and (for this listener) elevates it into a poppier mode.\n\t\nFrom 'Loveher' through to closer 'She's On My Mind', *Mid Air* quickly felt very much as though it had been conceived as an album, as opposed to discrete songs. Both the mood, and the unfolding romantic narrative feel like a single journey, though one with identifiable landmarks. 'The Sea' is coy and meandering; 'Strong' is the big beat peak; 'Did I' dims the lights; late album highlight 'Enjoy Your Life' is an unimpeachable dance anthem.\n\t\nWith this release, Romy eclipses her xx band mate Jamie xx's 8th place on my 2015 list, for his solo debut *In Colour*. At this point, I'm impatiently awaiting another xx LP, and also more solo work from – with apologies to Oliver Sim, whose own solo record, *Hideous Bastard*, didn't entirely work for me last year – two of its members. If I could only have one though, at this point I'd choose Romy in a heartbeat. No record felt more like an embrace this year than *Mid Air*.\n\n### 2. Metric — *Formentera II*\n\nWhen it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. It’s more common in hip-hop (see eg. Jay-Z’s *In My Lifetime* vols. 1-3 & *The Blueprint* 1-3), but if a rock band is going to release multiple albums’ worth of material under one title, it usually comes in the form of a double-album: classics of the genre include The Beatles’ *The Beatles* (1968), Fleetwood Mac’s *Tusk* (1979), and Nine Inch Nails’ *The Fragile* (1999). \n\t\nThere are confusing outliers, such as Smashing Pumpkins’ insistence on giving certain releases a subtitle or volume number, which series potentially never to be added to. Guns n Roses’ threw a curveball in 1991 with the tandem releases of *Use Your Illusion* volumes I & II — essentially a double album, though you had to purchase both halves separately. All of which gave rise to conflicted feelings for me, when Metric announced that their 2022 masterpiece *Formentera* would get a direct continuation. \n\t\nOne cause for concern was the extent to which the situation seemed to echo Biffy Clyro having released *A Celebration of Endings* (14th for me in 2020), and then finding they had another album’s worth of material almost immediately. *The Myth of the Happily Ever After* (2021) was enjoyable enough, but did not place for me. Perhaps a more optimistic allegory would be Radiohead’s unfairly maligned *Amnesiac* (2001), certainly lesser than its immediate precursor, *Kid A* (2000), but a wonderful record in its own right. Was that a reasonable expectation? \n\t\nYou will recall, of course, that *Formentera* was my favourite album of last year, and at twelve months’ remove, I remain happy with that assessment. My end-of-2023 Apple Music rundown informs me that I have played no artist more frequently in this year than Metric, and it’s not exactly what might be considered close. The band also performed my favourite live show of the year: a couple of hours of synth-rock bliss at Camden’s Roundhouse, back in February. \n\n*Formentera II* itself very much continues the pandemic angst and desire for escapism that characterised the original record. Highlights include the ultra-catchy ‘Days of Oblivion’, the semi-autobiographical ‘Who Would You Be For Me’, and the teasing ‘Suckers’, which threatens to break out of itself at any moment. ‘Descendants’ feels like a closer, echoing some of the sentiments of epic *Formentera* opener ‘Doomscroller’, before actual closer ‘Go Ahead and Cry’ heralds the (false?) dawn of a new day, as we collectively awake from the fugue that Metric have so masterfully chronicled. \n\nHappily, I needn’t have worried when Metric stood back from the near flawless *Formentera*, and asked “want to see us do it again?” Lesson learned: the answer to that question, from this band, should always be yes.\n\t\n### 1. Olivia Rodrigo — *GUTS*\n\nWhen it comes to record releases, it’s not often you get a true sequel. When last we heard from Olivia, she was heartbroken and frustrated in the aftermath of a relationship gone — pun intended — *SOUR* (2021). Two years later, Rodrigo’s latest dispatch is another hymn book full of remarkable pop-rock gems, this time squarely aimed at the trials and tribulations of young adulthood. The heat and glare of the spotlight on someone in her position is almost unfathomably oppressive to the average person, and yet Rodrigo not only handles it with grace, she finds the words to elucidate her situation in a manner that renders it relatable. Too quickly pigeonholed as a pop phenomenon, Olivia is a wildly underrated lyricist. Opener ‘all-american bitch’ is (like many of her songs) a bombastic, ultra-self-aware jam — in this case on the precarity and impossibility of modern womanhood. Taken alongside tracks like ‘making the bed’ and closer ‘teenage dream’, the listener bears witness to a supremely talented songwriter wrestling with expectation, fame, and the ephemerality of youth. \n\t\nAll of that sounds quite heavy, which is misleading, because *GUTS* is also home to the same infectious, effervescent *joie de vivre* that characterised *SOUR*. There was no more self-effacingly goofy song this year than ‘ballad of a homeschooled girl’, unless it was ‘love is embarrassing’. And then there’s lead single (and my favourite song of 2023), ‘vampire’: a masterclass in song construction that fits the highs and lows of a riveting emotional journey into little more than three minutes.  \n\t\nI hit *GUTS* so hard when it released in September, that I had to force myself into taking a break. As a substitute, I found myself regularly playing Cyndi Lauper’s *She’s So Unusual* (1983), a now 40 year old pop landmark that carries its message across four decades as clearly as a bell. That’s the company in which I place Olivia Rodrigo, even at this early point in her career. I hope she’s around for decades to come, explaining the world and the heart through the medium of perfect pop music. \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

Joywave — <em>Possession</em></h3>\n<p>Three years ago Joywave announced themselves to me, and took second place on my 2017 list, with their sophomore album <em>Content</em>. At the time I said that I found the band ‘very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent’ and guess what? <em>Possession</em> is another assured, multi-faceted set of a dozen uncategorisable bops. Of the previous record I listed the genres touched upon as ‘including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…’ and that’s still all in the mix here though, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on the new album feels slightly more humane and less coldly electronic than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Like a Kennedy’ is, for me, one of the defining songs of the Trump / Brexit era: a vulnerable, exhausted lament that asks only for the simplest things amidst incomprehensible turmoil. ‘F.E.A.R.’ twists ‘Monster Mash’ DNA into a campy downbeat stomp, whereas ‘Funny Thing About Opinions’ is an upbeat treatise on the state of internet dialogue.</p>\n<p>This is another record of surprising, inventive dance-pop-rock cuts that was everything I wanted from more Joywave. I would love to see these guys live when that’s possible once more, though—with the same sense of humour apparent in their music—the band’s faux-Fox News website informs me that their touring has been postponed ‘due to pressure from health experts and communists’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-oliver-coates--skins-n-slime\">19. Oliver Coates — <em>skins n slime</em></h3>\n<p>On my spider-diagram of musical influences there would be a large number of lines spreading outwards from Radiohead, and Oliver Coates is the newest addition. It seems like a fitting way to encounter a classically trained cellist making something he’s called (probably with tongue firmly in cheek) ‘pastoral metal’.</p>\n<p>It’s a tough task to affix meaningful labels to what Coates is doing on <em>skins n slime</em>, and that’s not a bad thing. Sure, I take his allusion to metal, but there’s also drone influences à la Roly Porter, and minimalist composition à la William Basinski &amp; Steve Reich (with whom Coates has previously collaborated). The result is a singular mélange of a headphone record that I found mesmerising.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-empress-of--im-your-empress-of\">18. Empress Of — <em>I’m Your Empress Of</em></h3>\n<p>Despite this being her third record, Lorely Rodriguez—as Empress Of—is a new artist to me this year. She also, drum roll, made my favourite track of the year in the form of peerless, euphoric dance banger ‘Love is a Drug’. But that’s just one of the jewels on offer here. The album’s true opener (though it follows a sweet intro) ‘Bit of Rain’ is a house-infused treat, whereas ‘Shold’ve’ is a more complex, layered affair.</p>\n<p>Only three tracks break the three-minute barrier, and the album as a whole is only a little over a half hour, content to show up, put a smile on your face, and dip out leaving you wanting more. This was a trip I took dozens of times since the record’s release back in spring, and I’ll be playing it for a while yet. I’ll also be looking out both for remixes of what’s here, and for what Rodriguez does next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-phoebe-bridgers--punisher\">17. Phoebe Bridgers — <em>Punisher</em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someday, I&rsquo;m gonna live<br>\nIn your house up on the hill<br>\nAnd when your skinhead neighbor goes missing<br>\nI&rsquo;ll plant a garden in the yard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those are the first lines delivered on <em>Punisher</em>, and a fitting testament to the fact that no one told more compelling stories on record this year than Phoebe Bridgers. A stellar lyricist, she paints a series of vivid pictures for the listener, then uses them as the setting for raw emotional openness. It’s the same formula used by her partner in Better Oblivion Community Center: one Conor Oberst. But Bridgers is painting with softer brushes and – for the most part – a darker palette.</p>\n<p>The title track is a heart-rending ballad of loneliness, ‘Kyoto’ is a more up-beat invitation to sing along (if you can match Bridgers’ range), and album highlight ‘Savior Complex’ is a brilliantly judged balancing act that manages to be both delicate and devastating.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason Better Oblivion Community Center didn’t really work for me last year, but <em>Punisher</em> is persuasive proof that I need to go back to Bridgers’ solo debut (<em>Stranger in the Alps</em> (2017)), and also her work with Lucy Dacus in boygenius.</p>\n<p>Side note: Bridgers’ non-album <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JKPaA3p3bJU\">cover of Radiohead’s ‘Fake Plastic Trees’</a> (with Arlo Parks) is outstanding.</p>\n<p>Second side note: despite its June release I was late in coming to this album for whatever reason, and I get the distinct feeling it’s not done growing on me. Ask me in 6-12 months and this may well have climbed up a fair few places.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-holy-fuck--deleter\">16. Holy Fuck — <em>Deleter</em></h3>\n<p>HF took 7th place on this list in 2016 with their previous album: <em>Congrats</em>. I never did do the work of going back and exploring their catalogue — which is something I still <em>should</em> do — but when I saw a new LP drop at the beginning of 2020 I jumped on it. This is a record that has stuck around for me all year, and which doesn’t sound like anything else on this list.</p>\n<p>HF are a band doing their own thing in their own way: bending all manner of instruments to make a supreme electronic racket with a pulse. However, the guests on <em>Deleter</em>’s opening couple of tracks make for an interesting way of triangulating the band’s place on the musical map. The understated build and break of ‘Luxe’ features Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and the more forthright follow-up of a title track includes Angus Andrew of Liars. (I made an additional comparison to Battles last time, and that still stands.)</p>\n<p>My favourite track on an inventive, restless record is ‘Moment’, with its build-and-build again dynamic and krautrock hard edge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-surfer-blood--carefree-theatre\">15. Surfer Blood — <em>Carefree Theatre</em></h3>\n<p>The last two Surfer Blood records (<em>1000 Palms</em> (2015) &amp; <em>Snowdonia</em> (2017)) haven’t found a spot in my top 20, though I remember enjoying both of them. Happily, <em>Carefree Theatre</em> is very much a return to the heights of <em>Pythons</em> (18th in 2013), if not quite <em>Astro Coast</em> (6th in 2010).</p>\n<p>The sunny Florida quartet still have a way with a simple melody, decorated with pretty harmonics, and a knack for undercutting it all with a weirdly twisted lyric or unexpected shift in the tune (eg. the way the guitar line finds an unexpected low note on ‘Parkland (Into Silence)’). I’m aware that I may be being influenced by the fact they have a song referencing the director, but there’s a Lynchian twist at play here: a dive from the white picket vista to the squirming bugs in the soil. It’s the gambit Pixies perfected several decades ago, but it’s nice to hear a different take on it.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done the work of going back to the third and fourth records, but I expect I would find that they were weakened relatively by virtue of Surfer Blood stretching to expand their sound. Simplicity is this band’s friend, and seems key to the bright three-minute pieces they’re capable of crafting. On this record they’re embracing it with great results, even if album closer ‘Rose Bowl’ makes for disconcerting listening at the end of 2020:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the first day of the New Year<br>\nMorning, January first<br>\nThis past year wasn’t great<br>\nAnd I think it’s getting worse</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"14-biffy-clyro--a-celebration-of-endings\">14. Biffy Clyro — <em>A Celebration of Endings</em></h3>\n<p>Previously on this list: 9th in 2007 with <em>Puzzle</em>; 3rd in 2013 with <em>Opposites</em> and, of course, 1st in 2009 with <em>Only Revolutions</em>. Notable for its absence in that list is 2016’s <em>Ellipsis</em>, which I found to be uneven at best and did not get played much after the first couple of listens. For that reason I approached <em>A Celebration of Endings</em> with both hope and caution. I was very pleased to find that it was the former that was warranted.</p>\n<p>‘North is No South’ is a statement of intent, and then it gives way to a run of four tracks (‘The Champ’ – ‘Worst Type of Best Possible’) as strong as anything the Scots have ever committed to tape. ‘Space’ is the kind of ballad that probably has Matt Cardle dreaming of another Christmas number 1, and then ‘End Of’ hits you over the head with a blackjack. As was the case with the previous three Biffy albums to make this list there’s not a bad track here. There are weaker moments (‘The Pink Limit’ doesn’t totally work for me), but they’re hugely outnumbered by consistently arresting songwriting and the band’s knack for finding strange new ways to twist a riff or subvert a time signature.</p>\n<p>That’s true from the the bruiser of an opening track, right until ‘Cop Syrup’ plays the record out like a weird update of Nirvana’s ‘Beeswax’ (1992).</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-the-beths--jump-rope-gazers\">13. The Beths — <em>Jump Rope Gazers</em></h3>\n<p>There were so many good records two years ago that I ended up appending a ‘next best 30’ list to the main top 20 – that’s how I know that The Beths’ fuzzed-up guitars and playful percussion only just missed a spot on the 2018 list for their debut <em>Future Me Hates Me</em>. The follow-up is a stronger record on which the New Zealand quartet have honed their formidable sense of melody to a fine point.</p>\n<p>I’m hearing some that dog. in here, only Elizabeth Stokes’s voice is warmer and lighter than Anna Waronker’s delivery often was. Moments like the vocal somersaults on opener ‘I’m Not Getting Excited’ still thrill me on each listen.</p>\n<p>There’s a little dip in quality at the middle of the running order, but it picks right back up with the cheerily plaintive ‘Don’t Go Away’, before heading into album highlight ‘Mars, The God of War’: a sub-three-minute pop rock gem and the best song I know to include the word ‘optometry’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-deftones--ohms\">12. Deftones — <em>Ohms</em></h3>\n<p>As I type this there is a newly released version of Deftones’ best record sat, as yet unheard, on my hard drive. <em>White Pony / Black Stallion</em> is a remaster and a set of remixes in celebration of the 20th anniversary of an album that I would still pack for a desert island.</p>\n<p>Deftones are one of the very few bands for whom every one of their records has made my list over the years, so let’s review placements:</p>\n<p><em>White Pony</em> 3rd in 2000 ☨<br>\n<em>Deftones</em> 12th in 2003;<br>\n<em>Saturday Night Wrist</em> 9th in 2006;<br>\n<em>Diamond Eyes</em> 9th in 2010;<br>\n<em>Koi No Yokan</em> 1st in 2012;<br>\n<em>Gore</em> 20th in 2016</p>\n<p>When I looked back on the preceding decade in 2005 I also retroactively had their debut <em>Adrenaline</em> 1st for 1995, and the follow-up <em>Around the Fur</em> 3rd for 1997.</p>\n<p>But what of the new offering? After flirtations with Bob Ezrin, Nick Raskulinecz, &amp; Matt Hyde on their last four albums, Deftones reunite here with Terry Date: the producer on their first four albums. The result is a record that sounds every bit as brutal and sonically deep as their masterpiece. There’s proof on every track of <em>Ohms</em> that this is a band still able to wrangle cacophony like no one else, threading it through with both taut wires of urgent passion and flowing ribbons of melody.</p>\n<p>‘Urantia’ is a Pantera riff being absorbed into a great lost Soundgarden song; ‘Radiant City’ is restless water chopped up by a sea monster moving slowly in the deep. And, title track and closer ‘Ohms’, is the best song they’ve written in two decades.</p>\n<p>☨ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m relatively confident that if I reviewed this year now <em>White Pony</em> would take 2nd from Eminem’s <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em> and would be snapping at the heels of Radiohead’s <em>Kid A</em> for the top spot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"11-fiona-apple--fetch-the-bolt-cutters\">11. Fiona Apple — <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know where to begin with this record. After having listened to it dozens of times I still feel like I’m barely finding my way into it. And yet it’s mesmerising and breathtaking in new ways each time I give it the attention it deserves – which is to say, when I can lie down with headphones on and do nothing else.</p>\n<p>Apple’s previous album (<em>The Idler Wheel…</em>) ended up 17th on my list in 2012, but only four other records on that list have lasted for me over the eight years since. I’m old friends with that album now, I know the raucous ‘Every Single Night’ and the dizzying ‘Hot Knife’ like old friends. But I still recall when I first encountered the album, and how it took time before confusion gave way to awe. Fiona Apple doesn’t make easily digestible, parseable music. But just as years spent loving <em>Extraordinary Machine</em> (2005) were inadequate preparation for <em>Idler Wheel…</em>, eight years spent in the company of that album wasn’t enough to get my brain ready for <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>.</p>\n<p>That’s two paragraphs of preamble to mask the fact that I still don’t really know how to talk about this record, except to say that by the time Apple starts making dolphin noises in the last 20 seconds of opener ‘I Want You To Love Me’, you’re likely either in or out. I, evidently, was in all the way: through the anthem to self belief ‘Shameika’, the self confidence mantra ‘Under the Table’, or the howl in the face of depression ‘Heavy Balloon’.</p>\n<p>There is a book to be written about the instrumentation on <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>, the way it’s layered, the way Apple’s voice (often in duplicate or triplicate) weaves in and out of it, the way it seems to fly in the face of conventional time signatures to create music that keeps you guessing even on the fifteenth listen. I’m not music scholar enough to attempt anything close to the analysis this record deserves. This is the best way I can find to phrase it: nothing sounds like a Fiona Apple record, and no other Fiona Apple record sounds quite like this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-four-tet--sixteen-oceans\">10. Four Tet — <em>Sixteen Oceans</em></h3>\n<p>It will be no surprise to find Kieran Hebden occupying a place on this list: previous appearances include <em>There is Love in You</em> (17th in 2010); <em>Pink</em> (10th in 2012); &amp; <em>New Energy</em> (7th in 2017), and I have a feeling that if I were to rewrite the 2013 list now <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> would make an appearance – it’s certainly had more staying power for me than a number of records on that list. Heck, I still play 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> at least a couple of times each year.</p>\n<p><em>Sixteen Oceans</em> displays the same delicate balances with which Four Tet has been playing for more than two decades: electronic / acoustic; played / sampled; digital / human. These levels shift pleasingly and subtly throughout the runtime of the record, in a manner which made it for me very much an album as opposed to a collection of disparate tracks. As I replayed it, even the four shorter interstitial pieces came to feel like necessary, brilliantly judged transitional moments.</p>\n<p>Highlights for me are the singular pulse of ‘Teenage Birdsong’, and the glowing swell of (the otherwise admittedly slight) ‘4T Recordings’. Arguably there’s less innovation on <em>Sixteen Oceans</em> than there has been on previous Four Tet albums, but I don’t necessarily miss it. I still find Hebden’s work captivating, moving, and worthy of frequent revisiting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-caribou--suddenly\">9. Caribou — <em>Suddenly</em></h3>\n<p>Caribou previously appeared on one of these lists when he took 11th place in 2014 with <em>Our Love</em>. That was a record that tapped into hazy house music vibes to great effect, and there are still notes of that in evidence on this year’s release. Overall, however, <em>Suddenly</em> is more wide-ranging. It borrows from all over the dance / electronica spectrum, and unifies the results by threading the patchwork through with Dan Snaith’s falsetto.</p>\n<p>Album highlight ‘Home’ is as soulful and warm as opener ‘Sister’ is cool and stand-offish: both are sub-three minute musical jewels. Each track here has been painstakingly constructed from a broad array of influences, such that each sounds different from one another and yet uniquely like Caribou. It’s a similar art to that practiced by (former tour mates) Radiohead: somehow you know a piece of music is theirs even when it sounds unlike anything they’ve made before. Amongst my favourite tracks on the record, ‘Never Come Back’ &amp; ‘Ravi’ are imbued with the kind of warmth that just glows through your headphones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-haim--women-in-music-pt-iii\">8. HAIM — <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em></h3>\n<p>HAIM’s last album — <em>Something To Tell You</em> — didn’t find a spot on my 2017 list. Despite a handful of very good tracks, and no outright bad ones, it never seemed to reach anything like the heights of the debut: <em>Days Are Gone</em>, which was awarded 6th place back in 2013. Even on first listen it was clear to me that on <em>Women in Music Pt. III</em> HAIM had recaptured the magic of their debut.</p>\n<p>The formula should be familiar now: three gifted musicians who also hold the unfair advantage of being sisters, which seems to explain why their voices harmonise so perfectly. Using those tools, and a great ear for melodic hooks, they produce a more thoroughly Californian update of Fleetwood Mac’s blues-infused pop-rock.</p>\n<p>And on their third LP they’re making some of their best music. ‘The Steps’ is forthright and foot-stomping; its younger sister – album closer ‘FUBT’ – is a more vulnerable lament. And HAIM are happy and able to play anywhere along that spectrum. Album highlight ‘Don’t Wanna’ is both achingly sweet and vulnerable whilst its percussion and soaring chorus project a core of strength.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple of surprises that work surprisingly well: chief amongst them ‘3am’, which sounds like it fell off a Jennifer Lopez record a couple of decades ago, and which I couldn’t get enough of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-georgia--seeking-thrills\">7. Georgia — <em>Seeking Thrills</em></h3>\n<p>Only two of the dozen nominees for this year’s Mercury Music Prize also has the (no less prestigious) honour of being awarded a place in my top 20.</p>\n<p><em>Seeking Thrills</em> is one of the year’s most optimistic records; it’s awash with infectious positivity. There are certainly downtempo moments, such as the coy, understated self-belief mantra ‘Till I Own It’, but there are several tracks obviously destined to soundtrack late night and early hours on dancefloors. The chorus of ‘Never Let You Go’ is a burst of beautiful euphoria set in a polyrhythmic bed that’s urging you to dance at two different tempos at once; ‘Feel It’ has the DNA of an MIA track, but with a dance twist; ’24 Hours’ evolves masterfully into an effervescent gem.</p>\n<p>The first half of the album is stronger than the latter half, but there are no weak tracks. Since its release in the second week of the year this has been an easy-listening pleasure that I’ve yet to tire of replaying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-taylor-swift--evermore\">6. Taylor Swift — <em>evermore</em></h3>\n<p>This has been the year of disrupted plans and unforeseen twists. Thus it’s fitting that I had this whole list written before Taylor Swift decided to celebrate her birthday by surprise releasing an album, with ~16 hours' notice, on 11 December. Hence, two weeks’ later, here I am on Boxing Day re-writing things to give this record its rightful place.</p>\n<p>As with her other quarantine album (July’s <em>folklore</em>) this is Swift in a storytelling mode, delicately and precisely teasing out the emotional truths of any situation she turns her attention to: failed proposals on ‘champagne problems’, imbalances of affection within relationships on ‘tolerate it’ . She’s telling the story of her own grandmother on ‘marjorie’, and spinning a tale of murder and revenge on the HAIM-featuring ‘No Body, No Crime’ – both the most fun Swift had on record this year, and her catchiest song of 2020.</p>\n<p>Sonically though, there’s more of a sense of exploration here than on Swift’s other 2020 release. The template of simply arranged, delicately composed folk pop that was set on <em>folklore</em> is pulled here into slightly different shapes. There’s a drum machine on ‘one story short’, and skittering beats and whooshes underneath the outro of ‘happiness’, and again throughout ‘closure’. There’s one of the clearest nods to her country music roots since <em>Speak Now</em> (2010) on ‘cowboy like me’.</p>\n<p>You can probably tell from how this entry is written that, with five entries left to go, we’re not done with Taylor Swift in 2020. I’ll have more to say then.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Also: shout out to the Detroit post-hardcore quartet Dogleg who held the 20th spot on this list before Taylor dropped a last minute bombshell, necessitating a re-write; their debut <em>Melee</em> is officially my twenty-first favourite LP of 2020.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"5-hayley-williams--petals-for-armor\">5. Hayley Williams — <em>Petals for Armor</em></h3>\n<p>The last three Paramore records have been at four year intervals (not that I’m counting down), and they’ve reliably taken their place in the middle of my lists: 8th in 2009 for <em>Brand New Eyes</em>, 12th in 2013 for <em>Paramore</em>, and 10th in 2017 with <em>After Laughter</em>. As such it’s a welcome surprise to find frontwoman Hayley Williams so far up this list when she’s out on her own.</p>\n<p>Musically this solo work is less vibrantly bombastic than Paramore’s more recent output, but no less catchy or endearing. Despite deeply personal subject matter (including depression, divorce, and recovery) Williams has crafted a collection of electronic-tinged pop-rock that it’s impossible not to fall for. Over the course of 15 tracks she explores some more experimental percussion and production (such as on the stuttering-then-flowing, Fiona Apple-esque ‘Cinnamon’) as well as showcasing her ear for a hook, such as on the powerful earworm ‘Dead Horse’ and the Sunday-afternoon radio ballad ‘Pure Love’. The result is an hour of consistently arresting, energising music that draws from an impressively wide emotional range.</p>\n<p>Few would deny that the defining characteristic of Paramore as a band is Hayley Williams’s unmistakable voice. Whisper to roar, and across a truly impressive tonal range, few rock singers can match her. Unsurprisingly that is also the strength of her first solo outing, though her consistently evolving songwriting is a close second.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-beach-bunny--honeymoon\">4. Beach Bunny — <em>Honeymoon</em></h3>\n<p>This record is nine tracks and 25 minutes of relentless, sunny pop-rock. It’s proof if proof was needed that throwing four kids into a rehearsal room with a couple of guitars and a drum set can still result in something life-affirming and marvellous.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Promises’ is first light and bubbly, and then strident and anthemic; it’s followed up with the sing-along whilst you dance-along ‘Cuffing Season’, then we drop a couple of gears for the raw, earnest ‘April’. And we’re off to the races on a giddy whirlwind tour of three-chords-and-hummable-choruses pop. By the time you reach cartwheeling closer, and album high point, ‘Cloud 9’ you’re ready to do it all again. Go on, treat yourself. You can find 25 minutes.</p>\n<p>I’m a simple man, and Weezer’s self-titled debut is my seventh-favourite record of all time. I needed something this bright and uncomplicated this year, and my thanks go out to this Chicago quartet for delivering it so effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-taylor-swift--folklore\">3. Taylor Swift — <em>folklore</em></h3>\n<p>Last year’s number one released this record with 24 hours’ notice back in July, and it has been a staple on my headphones ever since. A very different-sounding record to 2019’s <em>Lover</em>, working (for the most part) in a more subdued register, <em>folklore</em> is another showcase for a phenomenal songwriting talent. There are no anthemic, danceable pop explosions here, but the more muted tone and stripped back instrumentation allow for Swift’s vocals to shine, and for her lyricism to take centre stage.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s (on ‘The Last Great American Dynasty’) telling the story of Rebekah Harkness, who used to live in the home Swift now owns, or laying out the dynamics of a love triangle over the course of three songs (‘Cardigan’, ‘August’, &amp; ‘Betty’), Swift displays a songwriting touch as light and dextrous as the voice with which she brings those songs to life. Album highlight for me (at least at present) is Swift’s duet with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon on ‘Exile’ - a lyrically exquisite heartbreaker wherein the two voices play with and against one another perfectly.</p>\n<p>Following the surprise release of the album, Swift also put out a combination making-of documentary / live performance on Disney+ which offered insight on how the record came to be, and how her collaboration with The National’s Aaron Dessner came to bear this fruit. It also serves as an interesting document of how an artist usually wrapped in layers of hype and marketing, found freedom in isolation to make something intimate. The record is a fascinating balance: it represents the furthest Swift has gone into telling others’ stories (fictional and otherwise), yet each song is imbued with deeply personal feeling.</p>\n<p>Swift’s work in 2020 has been, frankly, stunning - as evidenced by her having performed the unprecedented feat of securing two spots in the top six places of this list. Having stepped outside of both the aesthetic trappings and sonic bombast usually expected of pop’s reigning queen, she has made a strong case for being recognised as a generational songwriting talent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-halsey--manic\">2. Halsey — <em>Manic</em></h3>\n<p>When you open your third record on a song titled with your given name (‘Ashley’) you’re making a statement: I’m here to share something; this is coming from the heart. When you close that track with a snippet of audio from <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, you’re signalling an emotional register of earnest vulnerability. Carrying off that conversation over the course of 16 pop songs is a tall order, and yet <em>Manic</em> is an unbridled success.</p>\n<p>Someone smarter than me could probably take the musical DNA of ‘Forever … (is a long time)’ / ‘Dominic’s Interlude’ / ‘I HATE EVERYBODY’, examine it under an electron microscope, and figure out why it makes me feel the same way as sections of My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> (2006). I’m not equipped to work out the reasons, I can just tell you that it happens. The first track uses piano to effect a shift from major to minor key; the second is an organ-backed, multi-tracked, 76 second opera;  the third is a series of crescendos hitting like waves on a beach. It’s a masterful seven minutes at the centre of a bewilderingly good record.</p>\n<p>Oh, and then the second half of the record kicks off with the barnstorming pop-rock ‘3am’, and then the dimly lit, sultry ‘Without Me’, then the lost KT Tunstall track I didn’t know I wanted: ‘Finally // beautiful stranger’. By the time Halsey is singing an LGBT empowerment duet with Alanis Morissette you feel it’s company they should feel comfortable keeping.</p>\n<p>Folk, pop, indie rock, R&amp;B, Korean rap - this record includes a lot, and some reviews read that as coming at the expense of depth. For me it all works seamlessly almost without exception, making <em>Manic</em> read like a personal, and deeply felt record, that also happens to be a pop gem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-dua-lipa--future-nostalgia\">1. Dua Lipa — <em>Future Nostalgia</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s the other Mercury nominee, and (I have just learned) Spotify’s most played female artist of 2020. So firmly is the 2020 pop crown sat atop Dua’s head that one of her best tracks of the year isn’t even on this record, it’s over on Miley Cyrus’s <em>Plastic Hearts</em> - the high point of an album that very nearly made this list.</p>\n<p>Whilst Taylor Swift was writing folk ballads in a woodland cabin it seems Dua was channeling the attentions of the pop gods to teach a neon-soaked masterclass in funk and disco-infused bangers. This is music designed in a lab to destroy radios, dance floors, and TikTok alike. All of which would be for nothing if it wasn’t, from start to finish, an unmitigated success. You cannot fail to smile, you absolutely will nod along, sing along, and feel some of these beats in your bones.</p>\n<p>The Pitchfork review of <em>Future Nostalgia</em> has a good line in which they say that the album ‘sounds like three Madonna eras at once’. As someone who has a huge amount of affection for pretty much all of Madonna’s eras (not you <em>American Life</em>, you can sit down) this is a recipe for success in my mind. Providing, that is, that you can walk in Madonna’s shadow – not an easy thing to do. Dua comes armed with the disco beats of peak Kylie, and a faultless ear for both a groove and a beat. The result is a remarkable pop record that samples White Town on ‘Love Again’, and channels John Deacon on ‘Break My Heart’, but also sounds entirely cohesive and possessed of limitless self-confidence.</p>\n<p>The title track, ‘Don’t Start Now’, ‘Physical’, ‘Hallucinate’, and ‘Break My Heart’ could each be career-defining encores for a lot of artists. As it stands, I get the feeling that this is just the beginning of what Dua Lipa is capable of.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This is the second year that my list has been topped by a thoroughbred pop record, and there are more albums elsewhere on the list this year than ever before which fall in that category. What I find particularly interesting is that the great bulk of my music-listening year is taken up with records from all over the genre map. At the time of writing I’ve listened to 213 records released in 2020 at least once through. From ambient and drone to jazz and metal I found records this year that I really enjoyed. But when the chips are down and I have to pick the records that genuinely gave me the most pleasure, increasingly it’s pop music that I turn to. Perhaps two years in a row is a coincidence, but even if the 2021 list doesn’t end up having a pop album on top I’ll be shocked if there isn’t a handful of them in the mix.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Joywave — *Possession*\n\nThree years ago Joywave announced themselves to me, and took second place on my 2017 list, with their sophomore album *Content*. At the time I said that I found the band ‘very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent’ and guess what? *Possession* is another assured, multi-faceted set of a dozen uncategorisable bops. Of the previous record I listed the genres touched upon as ‘including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…’ and that’s still all in the mix here though, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on the new album feels slightly more humane and less coldly electronic than its predecessor. \n\nOpener ‘Like a Kennedy’ is, for me, one of the defining songs of the Trump / Brexit era: a vulnerable, exhausted lament that asks only for the simplest things amidst incomprehensible turmoil. ‘F.E.A.R.’ twists ‘Monster Mash’ DNA into a campy downbeat stomp, whereas ‘Funny Thing About Opinions’ is an upbeat treatise on the state of internet dialogue.\n\nThis is another record of surprising, inventive dance-pop-rock cuts that was everything I wanted from more Joywave. I would love to see these guys live when that’s possible once more, though—with the same sense of humour apparent in their music—the band’s faux-Fox News website informs me that their touring has been postponed ‘due to pressure from health experts and communists’. \n\n###  19. Oliver Coates — *skins n slime*\n\nOn my spider-diagram of musical influences there would be a large number of lines spreading outwards from Radiohead, and Oliver Coates is the newest addition. It seems like a fitting way to encounter a classically trained cellist making something he’s called (probably with tongue firmly in cheek) ‘pastoral metal’. \n\nIt’s a tough task to affix meaningful labels to what Coates is doing on *skins n slime*, and that’s not a bad thing. Sure, I take his allusion to metal, but there’s also drone influences à la Roly Porter, and minimalist composition à la William Basinski & Steve Reich (with whom Coates has previously collaborated). The result is a singular mélange of a headphone record that I found mesmerising.\n\n###  18. Empress Of — *I’m Your Empress Of*\n\nDespite this being her third record, Lorely Rodriguez—as Empress Of—is a new artist to me this year. She also, drum roll, made my favourite track of the year in the form of peerless, euphoric dance banger ‘Love is a Drug’. But that’s just one of the jewels on offer here. The album’s true opener (though it follows a sweet intro) ‘Bit of Rain’ is a house-infused treat, whereas ‘Shold’ve’ is a more complex, layered affair. \n\nOnly three tracks break the three-minute barrier, and the album as a whole is only a little over a half hour, content to show up, put a smile on your face, and dip out leaving you wanting more. This was a trip I took dozens of times since the record’s release back in spring, and I’ll be playing it for a while yet. I’ll also be looking out both for remixes of what’s here, and for what Rodriguez does next. \n\n###  17. Phoebe Bridgers — *Punisher*\n\n> Someday, I'm gonna live  \n> In your house up on the hill  \n> And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing  \n> I'll plant a garden in the yard  \n\nThose are the first lines delivered on *Punisher*, and a fitting testament to the fact that no one told more compelling stories on record this year than Phoebe Bridgers. A stellar lyricist, she paints a series of vivid pictures for the listener, then uses them as the setting for raw emotional openness. It’s the same formula used by her partner in Better Oblivion Community Center: one Conor Oberst. But Bridgers is painting with softer brushes and – for the most part – a darker palette. \n\nThe title track is a heart-rending ballad of loneliness, ‘Kyoto’ is a more up-beat invitation to sing along (if you can match Bridgers’ range), and album highlight ‘Savior Complex’ is a brilliantly judged balancing act that manages to be both delicate and devastating. \n\nFor whatever reason Better Oblivion Community Center didn’t really work for me last year, but *Punisher* is persuasive proof that I need to go back to Bridgers’ solo debut (*Stranger in the Alps* (2017)), and also her work with Lucy Dacus in boygenius.   \n  \nSide note: Bridgers’ non-album [cover of Radiohead’s ‘Fake Plastic Trees’](https://youtu.be/JKPaA3p3bJU) (with Arlo Parks) is outstanding.  \n\nSecond side note: despite its June release I was late in coming to this album for whatever reason, and I get the distinct feeling it’s not done growing on me. Ask me in 6-12 months and this may well have climbed up a fair few places.\n\n###  16. Holy Fuck — *Deleter*\n\nHF took 7th place on this list in 2016 with their previous album: *Congrats*. I never did do the work of going back and exploring their catalogue — which is something I still *should* do — but when I saw a new LP drop at the beginning of 2020 I jumped on it. This is a record that has stuck around for me all year, and which doesn’t sound like anything else on this list. \n\nHF are a band doing their own thing in their own way: bending all manner of instruments to make a supreme electronic racket with a pulse. However, the guests on *Deleter*’s opening couple of tracks make for an interesting way of triangulating the band’s place on the musical map. The understated build and break of ‘Luxe’ features Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and the more forthright follow-up of a title track includes Angus Andrew of Liars. (I made an additional comparison to Battles last time, and that still stands.) \n\nMy favourite track on an inventive, restless record is ‘Moment’, with its build-and-build again dynamic and krautrock hard edge. \n\n###  15. Surfer Blood — *Carefree Theatre*\n\nThe last two Surfer Blood records (*1000 Palms* (2015) & *Snowdonia* (2017)) haven’t found a spot in my top 20, though I remember enjoying both of them. Happily, *Carefree Theatre* is very much a return to the heights of *Pythons* (18th in 2013), if not quite *Astro Coast* (6th in 2010). \n\nThe sunny Florida quartet still have a way with a simple melody, decorated with pretty harmonics, and a knack for undercutting it all with a weirdly twisted lyric or unexpected shift in the tune (eg. the way the guitar line finds an unexpected low note on ‘Parkland (Into Silence)’). I’m aware that I may be being influenced by the fact they have a song referencing the director, but there’s a Lynchian twist at play here: a dive from the white picket vista to the squirming bugs in the soil. It’s the gambit Pixies perfected several decades ago, but it’s nice to hear a different take on it. \n\nI haven’t done the work of going back to the third and fourth records, but I expect I would find that they were weakened relatively by virtue of Surfer Blood stretching to expand their sound. Simplicity is this band’s friend, and seems key to the bright three-minute pieces they’re capable of crafting. On this record they’re embracing it with great results, even if album closer ‘Rose Bowl’ makes for disconcerting listening at the end of 2020:\n\n> On the first day of the New Year  \n> Morning, January first  \n> This past year wasn’t great  \n> And I think it’s getting worse  \n\n###  14. Biffy Clyro — *A Celebration of Endings*\n\nPreviously on this list: 9th in 2007 with *Puzzle*; 3rd in 2013 with *Opposites* and, of course, 1st in 2009 with *Only Revolutions*. Notable for its absence in that list is 2016’s *Ellipsis*, which I found to be uneven at best and did not get played much after the first couple of listens. For that reason I approached *A Celebration of Endings* with both hope and caution. I was very pleased to find that it was the former that was warranted. \n\n‘North is No South’ is a statement of intent, and then it gives way to a run of four tracks (‘The Champ’ – ‘Worst Type of Best Possible’) as strong as anything the Scots have ever committed to tape. ‘Space’ is the kind of ballad that probably has Matt Cardle dreaming of another Christmas number 1, and then ‘End Of’ hits you over the head with a blackjack. As was the case with the previous three Biffy albums to make this list there’s not a bad track here. There are weaker moments (‘The Pink Limit’ doesn’t totally work for me), but they’re hugely outnumbered by consistently arresting songwriting and the band’s knack for finding strange new ways to twist a riff or subvert a time signature. \n\nThat’s true from the the bruiser of an opening track, right until ‘Cop Syrup’ plays the record out like a weird update of Nirvana’s ‘Beeswax’ (1992). \n\n### 13. The Beths — *Jump Rope Gazers*\n\nThere were so many good records two years ago that I ended up appending a ‘next best 30’ list to the main top 20 – that’s how I know that The Beths’ fuzzed-up guitars and playful percussion only just missed a spot on the 2018 list for their debut *Future Me Hates Me*. The follow-up is a stronger record on which the New Zealand quartet have honed their formidable sense of melody to a fine point. \n\nI’m hearing some that dog. in here, only Elizabeth Stokes’s voice is warmer and lighter than Anna Waronker’s delivery often was. Moments like the vocal somersaults on opener ‘I’m Not Getting Excited’ still thrill me on each listen.\n\nThere’s a little dip in quality at the middle of the running order, but it picks right back up with the cheerily plaintive ‘Don’t Go Away’, before heading into album highlight ‘Mars, The God of War’: a sub-three-minute pop rock gem and the best song I know to include the word ‘optometry’. \n\n###  12. Deftones — *Ohms*\n\nAs I type this there is a newly released version of Deftones’ best record sat, as yet unheard, on my hard drive. *White Pony / Black Stallion* is a remaster and a set of remixes in celebration of the 20th anniversary of an album that I would still pack for a desert island.  \n\nDeftones are one of the very few bands for whom every one of their records has made my list over the years, so let’s review placements:   \n\n*White Pony* 3rd in 2000 ☨  \n*Deftones* 12th in 2003;  \n*Saturday Night Wrist* 9th in 2006;  \n*Diamond Eyes* 9th in 2010;  \n*Koi No Yokan* 1st in 2012;  \n*Gore* 20th in 2016  \n\nWhen I looked back on the preceding decade in 2005 I also retroactively had their debut *Adrenaline* 1st for 1995, and the follow-up *Around the Fur* 3rd for 1997.\n  \nBut what of the new offering? After flirtations with Bob Ezrin, Nick Raskulinecz, & Matt Hyde on their last four albums, Deftones reunite here with Terry Date: the producer on their first four albums. The result is a record that sounds every bit as brutal and sonically deep as their masterpiece. There’s proof on every track of *Ohms* that this is a band still able to wrangle cacophony like no one else, threading it through with both taut wires of urgent passion and flowing ribbons of melody. \n\n‘Urantia’ is a Pantera riff being absorbed into a great lost Soundgarden song; ‘Radiant City’ is restless water chopped up by a sea monster moving slowly in the deep. And, title track and closer ‘Ohms’, is the best song they’ve written in two decades. \n\n☨ <font color=\"#cfcfcf\">I’m relatively confident that if I reviewed this year now *White Pony* would take 2nd from Eminem’s *The Marshall Mathers LP* and would be snapping at the heels of Radiohead’s *Kid A* for the top spot.</font>\n\n###  11. Fiona Apple — *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*\n\nI don’t know where to begin with this record. After having listened to it dozens of times I still feel like I’m barely finding my way into it. And yet it’s mesmerising and breathtaking in new ways each time I give it the attention it deserves – which is to say, when I can lie down with headphones on and do nothing else.\n\nApple’s previous album (*The Idler Wheel…*) ended up 17th on my list in 2012, but only four other records on that list have lasted for me over the eight years since. I’m old friends with that album now, I know the raucous ‘Every Single Night’ and the dizzying ‘Hot Knife’ like old friends. But I still recall when I first encountered the album, and how it took time before confusion gave way to awe. Fiona Apple doesn’t make easily digestible, parseable music. But just as years spent loving *Extraordinary Machine* (2005) were inadequate preparation for *Idler Wheel…*, eight years spent in the company of that album wasn’t enough to get my brain ready for *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*.\n\nThat’s two paragraphs of preamble to mask the fact that I still don’t really know how to talk about this record, except to say that by the time Apple starts making dolphin noises in the last 20 seconds of opener ‘I Want You To Love Me’, you’re likely either in or out. I, evidently, was in all the way: through the anthem to self belief ‘Shameika’, the self confidence mantra ‘Under the Table’, or the howl in the face of depression ‘Heavy Balloon’. \n\nThere is a book to be written about the instrumentation on *Fetch the Bolt Cutters*, the way it’s layered, the way Apple’s voice (often in duplicate or triplicate) weaves in and out of it, the way it seems to fly in the face of conventional time signatures to create music that keeps you guessing even on the fifteenth listen. I’m not music scholar enough to attempt anything close to the analysis this record deserves. This is the best way I can find to phrase it: nothing sounds like a Fiona Apple record, and no other Fiona Apple record sounds quite like this. \n\n###  10. Four Tet — *Sixteen Oceans*\n\nIt will be no surprise to find Kieran Hebden occupying a place on this list: previous appearances include *There is Love in You* (17th in 2010); *Pink* (10th in 2012); & *New Energy* (7th in 2017), and I have a feeling that if I were to rewrite the 2013 list now *Beautiful Rewind* would make an appearance – it’s certainly had more staying power for me than a number of records on that list. Heck, I still play 2003’s *Rounds* and 2005’s *Everything Ecstatic* at least a couple of times each year. \n\n*Sixteen Oceans* displays the same delicate balances with which Four Tet has been playing for more than two decades: electronic / acoustic; played / sampled; digital / human. These levels shift pleasingly and subtly throughout the runtime of the record, in a manner which made it for me very much an album as opposed to a collection of disparate tracks. As I replayed it, even the four shorter interstitial pieces came to feel like necessary, brilliantly judged transitional moments. \n\nHighlights for me are the singular pulse of ‘Teenage Birdsong’, and the glowing swell of (the otherwise admittedly slight) ‘4T Recordings’. Arguably there’s less innovation on *Sixteen Oceans* than there has been on previous Four Tet albums, but I don’t necessarily miss it. I still find Hebden’s work captivating, moving, and worthy of frequent revisiting.\n\n###  9. Caribou — *Suddenly*\n\nCaribou previously appeared on one of these lists when he took 11th place in 2014 with *Our Love*. That was a record that tapped into hazy house music vibes to great effect, and there are still notes of that in evidence on this year’s release. Overall, however, *Suddenly* is more wide-ranging. It borrows from all over the dance / electronica spectrum, and unifies the results by threading the patchwork through with Dan Snaith’s falsetto. \n\nAlbum highlight ‘Home’ is as soulful and warm as opener ‘Sister’ is cool and stand-offish: both are sub-three minute musical jewels. Each track here has been painstakingly constructed from a broad array of influences, such that each sounds different from one another and yet uniquely like Caribou. It’s a similar art to that practiced by (former tour mates) Radiohead: somehow you know a piece of music is theirs even when it sounds unlike anything they’ve made before. Amongst my favourite tracks on the record, ‘Never Come Back’ & ‘Ravi’ are imbued with the kind of warmth that just glows through your headphones.\n\n###  8. HAIM — *Women in Music Pt. III*\n\nHAIM’s last album — *Something To Tell You* — didn’t find a spot on my 2017 list. Despite a handful of very good tracks, and no outright bad ones, it never seemed to reach anything like the heights of the debut: *Days Are Gone*, which was awarded 6th place back in 2013. Even on first listen it was clear to me that on *Women in Music Pt. III* HAIM had recaptured the magic of their debut. \n\nThe formula should be familiar now: three gifted musicians who also hold the unfair advantage of being sisters, which seems to explain why their voices harmonise so perfectly. Using those tools, and a great ear for melodic hooks, they produce a more thoroughly Californian update of Fleetwood Mac’s blues-infused pop-rock. \n\nAnd on their third LP they’re making some of their best music. ‘The Steps’ is forthright and foot-stomping; its younger sister – album closer ‘FUBT’ – is a more vulnerable lament. And HAIM are happy and able to play anywhere along that spectrum. Album highlight ‘Don’t Wanna’ is both achingly sweet and vulnerable whilst its percussion and soaring chorus project a core of strength.   \n  \nThere are also a couple of surprises that work surprisingly well: chief amongst them ‘3am’, which sounds like it fell off a Jennifer Lopez record a couple of decades ago, and which I couldn’t get enough of. \n\n###  7. Georgia — *Seeking Thrills*\n\nOnly two of the dozen nominees for this year’s Mercury Music Prize also has the (no less prestigious) honour of being awarded a place in my top 20. \n\n*Seeking Thrills* is one of the year’s most optimistic records; it’s awash with infectious positivity. There are certainly downtempo moments, such as the coy, understated self-belief mantra ‘Till I Own It’, but there are several tracks obviously destined to soundtrack late night and early hours on dancefloors. The chorus of ‘Never Let You Go’ is a burst of beautiful euphoria set in a polyrhythmic bed that’s urging you to dance at two different tempos at once; ‘Feel It’ has the DNA of an MIA track, but with a dance twist; ’24 Hours’ evolves masterfully into an effervescent gem. \n\nThe first half of the album is stronger than the latter half, but there are no weak tracks. Since its release in the second week of the year this has been an easy-listening pleasure that I’ve yet to tire of replaying. \n\n###  6. Taylor Swift — *evermore*\n\nThis has been the year of disrupted plans and unforeseen twists. Thus it’s fitting that I had this whole list written before Taylor Swift decided to celebrate her birthday by surprise releasing an album, with ~16 hours' notice, on 11 December. Hence, two weeks’ later, here I am on Boxing Day re-writing things to give this record its rightful place. \n\nAs with her other quarantine album (July’s *folklore*) this is Swift in a storytelling mode, delicately and precisely teasing out the emotional truths of any situation she turns her attention to: failed proposals on ‘champagne problems’, imbalances of affection within relationships on ‘tolerate it’ . She’s telling the story of her own grandmother on ‘marjorie’, and spinning a tale of murder and revenge on the HAIM-featuring ‘No Body, No Crime’ – both the most fun Swift had on record this year, and her catchiest song of 2020.\n\nSonically though, there’s more of a sense of exploration here than on Swift’s other 2020 release. The template of simply arranged, delicately composed folk pop that was set on *folklore* is pulled here into slightly different shapes. There’s a drum machine on ‘one story short’, and skittering beats and whooshes underneath the outro of ‘happiness’, and again throughout ‘closure’. There’s one of the clearest nods to her country music roots since *Speak Now* (2010) on ‘cowboy like me’.\n\nYou can probably tell from how this entry is written that, with five entries left to go, we’re not done with Taylor Swift in 2020. I’ll have more to say then.\n\n<font color=\"#cfcfcf\">(Also: shout out to the Detroit post-hardcore quartet Dogleg who held the 20th spot on this list before Taylor dropped a last minute bombshell, necessitating a re-write; their debut *Melee* is officially my twenty-first favourite LP of 2020.)</font>\n\n###  5. Hayley Williams — *Petals for Armor*\n\nThe last three Paramore records have been at four year intervals (not that I’m counting down), and they’ve reliably taken their place in the middle of my lists: 8th in 2009 for *Brand New Eyes*, 12th in 2013 for *Paramore*, and 10th in 2017 with *After Laughter*. As such it’s a welcome surprise to find frontwoman Hayley Williams so far up this list when she’s out on her own.\n\nMusically this solo work is less vibrantly bombastic than Paramore’s more recent output, but no less catchy or endearing. Despite deeply personal subject matter (including depression, divorce, and recovery) Williams has crafted a collection of electronic-tinged pop-rock that it’s impossible not to fall for. Over the course of 15 tracks she explores some more experimental percussion and production (such as on the stuttering-then-flowing, Fiona Apple-esque ‘Cinnamon’) as well as showcasing her ear for a hook, such as on the powerful earworm ‘Dead Horse’ and the Sunday-afternoon radio ballad ‘Pure Love’. The result is an hour of consistently arresting, energising music that draws from an impressively wide emotional range.  \n\nFew would deny that the defining characteristic of Paramore as a band is Hayley Williams’s unmistakable voice. Whisper to roar, and across a truly impressive tonal range, few rock singers can match her. Unsurprisingly that is also the strength of her first solo outing, though her consistently evolving songwriting is a close second.\n\n### 4. Beach Bunny — *Honeymoon*\n\nThis record is nine tracks and 25 minutes of relentless, sunny pop-rock. It’s proof if proof was needed that throwing four kids into a rehearsal room with a couple of guitars and a drum set can still result in something life-affirming and marvellous. \n\nOpener ‘Promises’ is first light and bubbly, and then strident and anthemic; it’s followed up with the sing-along whilst you dance-along ‘Cuffing Season’, then we drop a couple of gears for the raw, earnest ‘April’. And we’re off to the races on a giddy whirlwind tour of three-chords-and-hummable-choruses pop. By the time you reach cartwheeling closer, and album high point, ‘Cloud 9’ you’re ready to do it all again. Go on, treat yourself. You can find 25 minutes. \n\nI’m a simple man, and Weezer’s self-titled debut is my seventh-favourite record of all time. I needed something this bright and uncomplicated this year, and my thanks go out to this Chicago quartet for delivering it so effectively. \n\n###  3. Taylor Swift — *folklore*\n\nLast year’s number one released this record with 24 hours’ notice back in July, and it has been a staple on my headphones ever since. A very different-sounding record to 2019’s *Lover*, working (for the most part) in a more subdued register, *folklore* is another showcase for a phenomenal songwriting talent. There are no anthemic, danceable pop explosions here, but the more muted tone and stripped back instrumentation allow for Swift’s vocals to shine, and for her lyricism to take centre stage. \n\nWhether it’s (on ‘The Last Great American Dynasty’) telling the story of Rebekah Harkness, who used to live in the home Swift now owns, or laying out the dynamics of a love triangle over the course of three songs (‘Cardigan’, ‘August’, & ‘Betty’), Swift displays a songwriting touch as light and dextrous as the voice with which she brings those songs to life. Album highlight for me (at least at present) is Swift’s duet with Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon on ‘Exile’ - a lyrically exquisite heartbreaker wherein the two voices play with and against one another perfectly. \n\nFollowing the surprise release of the album, Swift also put out a combination making-of documentary / live performance on Disney+ which offered insight on how the record came to be, and how her collaboration with The National’s Aaron Dessner came to bear this fruit. It also serves as an interesting document of how an artist usually wrapped in layers of hype and marketing, found freedom in isolation to make something intimate. The record is a fascinating balance: it represents the furthest Swift has gone into telling others’ stories (fictional and otherwise), yet each song is imbued with deeply personal feeling. \n\nSwift’s work in 2020 has been, frankly, stunning - as evidenced by her having performed the unprecedented feat of securing two spots in the top six places of this list. Having stepped outside of both the aesthetic trappings and sonic bombast usually expected of pop’s reigning queen, she has made a strong case for being recognised as a generational songwriting talent. \n\n###  2. Halsey — *Manic*\n\nWhen you open your third record on a song titled with your given name (‘Ashley’) you’re making a statement: I’m here to share something; this is coming from the heart. When you close that track with a snippet of audio from *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, you’re signalling an emotional register of earnest vulnerability. Carrying off that conversation over the course of 16 pop songs is a tall order, and yet *Manic* is an unbridled success. \n\nSomeone smarter than me could probably take the musical DNA of ‘Forever … (is a long time)’ / ‘Dominic’s Interlude’ / ‘I HATE EVERYBODY’, examine it under an electron microscope, and figure out why it makes me feel the same way as sections of My Chemical Romance’s *The Black Parade* (2006). I’m not equipped to work out the reasons, I can just tell you that it happens. The first track uses piano to effect a shift from major to minor key; the second is an organ-backed, multi-tracked, 76 second opera;  the third is a series of crescendos hitting like waves on a beach. It’s a masterful seven minutes at the centre of a bewilderingly good record.\n\nOh, and then the second half of the record kicks off with the barnstorming pop-rock ‘3am’, and then the dimly lit, sultry ‘Without Me’, then the lost KT Tunstall track I didn’t know I wanted: ‘Finally // beautiful stranger’. By the time Halsey is singing an LGBT empowerment duet with Alanis Morissette you feel it’s company they should feel comfortable keeping.  \n  \nFolk, pop, indie rock, R&B, Korean rap - this record includes a lot, and some reviews read that as coming at the expense of depth. For me it all works seamlessly almost without exception, making *Manic* read like a personal, and deeply felt record, that also happens to be a pop gem.\n\n###  1. Dua Lipa — *Future Nostalgia*\n\nHere’s the other Mercury nominee, and (I have just learned) Spotify’s most played female artist of 2020. So firmly is the 2020 pop crown sat atop Dua’s head that one of her best tracks of the year isn’t even on this record, it’s over on Miley Cyrus’s *Plastic Hearts* - the high point of an album that very nearly made this list.\n\nWhilst Taylor Swift was writing folk ballads in a woodland cabin it seems Dua was channeling the attentions of the pop gods to teach a neon-soaked masterclass in funk and disco-infused bangers. This is music designed in a lab to destroy radios, dance floors, and TikTok alike. All of which would be for nothing if it wasn’t, from start to finish, an unmitigated success. You cannot fail to smile, you absolutely will nod along, sing along, and feel some of these beats in your bones.\n\nThe Pitchfork review of *Future Nostalgia* has a good line in which they say that the album ‘sounds like three Madonna eras at once’. As someone who has a huge amount of affection for pretty much all of Madonna’s eras (not you *American Life*, you can sit down) this is a recipe for success in my mind. Providing, that is, that you can walk in Madonna’s shadow – not an easy thing to do. Dua comes armed with the disco beats of peak Kylie, and a faultless ear for both a groove and a beat. The result is a remarkable pop record that samples White Town on ‘Love Again’, and channels John Deacon on ‘Break My Heart’, but also sounds entirely cohesive and possessed of limitless self-confidence. \n\nThe title track, ‘Don’t Start Now’, ‘Physical’, ‘Hallucinate’, and ‘Break My Heart’ could each be career-defining encores for a lot of artists. As it stands, I get the feeling that this is just the beginning of what Dua Lipa is capable of.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nThis is the second year that my list has been topped by a thoroughbred pop record, and there are more albums elsewhere on the list this year than ever before which fall in that category. What I find particularly interesting is that the great bulk of my music-listening year is taken up with records from all over the genre map. At the time of writing I’ve listened to 213 records released in 2020 at least once through. From ambient and drone to jazz and metal I found records this year that I really enjoyed. But when the chips are down and I have to pick the records that genuinely gave me the most pleasure, increasingly it’s pop music that I turn to. Perhaps two years in a row is a coincidence, but even if the 2021 list doesn’t end up having a pop album on top I’ll be shocked if there isn’t a handful of them in the mix. \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

The game sounds absolutely unrelenting and brutal. That&rsquo;s a choice of tone that certainly fits the story it&rsquo;s telling and the world it&rsquo;s building, but which makes the experience feel ill suited to the current moment. Take this from Waypoint&rsquo;s review:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is over two dozen hours of spiraling cycles of violence and vengeance, being reminded roughly every hour that the whole endeavor is squalid and cruel. There is hardly a moment of joy it will not eventually curdle. A truly shocking number of characters that you will come to care about will be gruesomely mutilated, or slaughtered, or both.

I&rsquo;m simultaneously glad that Naughty Dog have pushed their game that far, and sure that this isn&rsquo;t a game for me. It&rsquo;s an encouraging sign of the medium&rsquo;s burgeoning maturity that there is space in video games for a AAA title to explore this emotional territory, but I find myself unwilling to take the journey right now. I know I&rsquo;ll be missing out on something special, and that by doing so I&rsquo;m placing myself on the outside of a conversation that will be ongoing for a while.

First single you ever bought</h3>\n<p><strong>Whitney Houston: ‘I Will Always Love You’</strong> — I can’t swear to this being the absolute first single I bought, but it’s the first I <em>remember</em> buying. It would have been during the song’s 23-week run on the UK chart between November 1992 and April 1993, and I distinctly recall that my two purchases from the Hereford branch of Our Price that day were this single, and the <em>Love Symbol</em> album by Prince &amp; the New Power Generation.</p>\n<p>This is obviously a flawless vocal performance by Houston, of whom my dad was a fan but to whom I paid too little attention into my 30s. (Both <em>Whitney Houston</em> (1985) and <em>Whitney</em> (1987) recently warranted re-listens when assessing my favourite records of the 1980s.)</p>\n<p>Ironically: I prefer the Dolly Parton original of this song these days.<br>\nDouble ironically: I’ve never seen <em>The Bodyguard</em>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-the-first-gig-you-ever-went-to\">2. The first gig you ever went to</h3>\n<p><strong>M People: ‘Don’t Look Any Further’</strong> — St David’s Hall, Cardiff. 1994? ‘Moving On Up’ and ‘Search for the Hero’ had the radio ubiquity, but whenever my dad would play the album, it was this song that captured my imagination. It is, as they say, still a bop.</p>\n<p>In keeping with the previous track, my preference these days is for the Dennis Edwards original principally because of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E7t8eoA_1jQ\">its bassline</a>, and in spite of its <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CH3rx8LhrQo\">mind-bendingly bad music video</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-one-or-both-of-your-parents\">3. A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents</h3>\n<p><strong>The Carpenters: ‘Top of the World’</strong> — I may not have agreed to this if I’d known it would lead to floods of tears. I haven’t played this since my mum’s funeral, and I will never not think of her when I hear anything by The Carpenters. On a related note, this is why art is so very important: it provides intangible, permanent connection to things that we’ve otherwise lost, and a means through which to feel and express things we otherwise aren’t sure how to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-a-teenage-crush\">4. A song that reminds you of a teenage crush</h3>\n<p><strong>Portishead: ‘Glory Box’</strong> — my first relationship that lasted more than a couple of months was with a very sweet, tomboyish girl. A few of our friendship group were very into Portishead’s first record, but I remember distinctly that she connected deeply with this particular song. Somehow it made more sense to me after she broke our relationship off, and began seeing a girl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-a-song-that-reminds-you-of-your-partner\">5. A song that reminds you of your partner</h3>\n<p><strong>The White Stripes: ‘The Air Near My Fingers’</strong> — My partner recently estimated that I spend 70% of my time thinking about food, and the rest thinking about her. Those percentages are wrong, but the sentiment isn’t. As such I don’t really need <em>reminding</em> of her, but here’s the song I associate most acutely with our early relationship. <em>Elephant</em> was the record that soundtracked a lot of what you might call our courtship, and this song in particular – with its refrain: “I get nervous when she comes around” – is 100% tied up with what it felt like getting to know her, and falling in love with her.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-a-song-that-you-wish-you-could-play-on-guitar\">6. A song that you wish you could play on guitar</h3>\n<p><strong>Prince’s contribution to ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ from the 2004 Rock Hall of Fame induction ceremony</strong> — I can’t play any songs on guitar, so I’m shooting for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y\">the heavens</a> on the understanding that if I could play this, I could play anything else I darn well pleased. I honestly can’t think of another single piece of guitar playing that is this transcendent. If I dedicated the rest of my life solely to learning this one guitar part I honestly don’t think I would ever get there. And even if I did, I still wouldn’t be able to <a href=\"https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/tom-petty-and-others-tell-the-story-behind-princes-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-solo\">make guitars magically disappear</a> into thin air.</p>\n<p>Side note: my second choice is Prince’s performance of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7NN3gsSf-Ys\">‘Purple Rain’</a> at the 2007 Super Bowl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-a-song-that-you-hope-never-to-hear-again\">7. A song that you hope never to hear again</h3>\n<p><strong>Foghat: ‘Slow Ride’</strong> — Firstly, this isn’t a good song. It’s a bad song. But there are other bad songs of its calibre: ‘House of the Rising Sun’, ‘The Girl from Ipanema’, and ‘Hotel California’ could all disappear from the Earth today and I’d be quite happy never to hear them ever again. I’m choosing the Foghat track for one specific reason: I must have listened to it upwards of 100 times, sometimes ~20 times in a row, whilst trying to 5-star it on <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em> (which I never did). The song sucks. Please erase it from existence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-a-guilty-pleasure\">8. A guilty pleasure</h3>\n<p>This is the first tough one; I don’t really feel any guilt about taking pleasure in art. I’ll tell anyone who will listen that Madonna’s ‘Borderline’ (<em>Immaculate Collection</em> Remix (1990)) is my favourite song. Would you like to hear about why Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Cut to the Feeling’ is a masterpiece? Do you want to discuss how Meatloaf’s 12 minute rock opera classic ‘I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)’ is, if anything, too short?</p>\n<p>Honestly, I feel more reticence naming My Chemical Romance’s <em>The Black Parade</em> as my favourite album because it carries all sorts of connotations with which I don’t entirely associate. But do I feel guilty? No your honour, I do not.</p>\n<p>So here’s the best I’ve got: <strong>Michael Jackson: ‘Leave Me Alone’</strong> — my favourite song by an artist I adored in the formative years of my music listening, and defended vociferously in the midst of allegations against him in the mid 90s. The music is still very special to me today, but that relationship is — obviously — more complicated now, and I’m not as firmly in the habit of loudly proclaiming my love of Michael Jackson as I once was.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-the-opposite-of-a-guilty-pleasure-ie-an-artistsong-you-didnt-like-but-pretended-to-like-to-look-cool\">9. The opposite of a guilty pleasure (i.e., an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)</h3>\n<p>I’m glad this is framed in the past tense, because (as above) I’m not someone who feels any guilt about the art they do or don’t like. That wasn’t always the case, however!</p>\n<p>In the mid-to-late 90s I had a circle of friends that were primarily into metal. I certainly loved a good number of bands under that label (Metallica, Sepultura, Korn et al) but for the most part my tastes paddled out of the shallow end to only chest-deep water. I was the grunge kid of the group really, but despite that being evidenced by my wearing petticoats and tights to club nights, for some reason I felt the need to at least pretend that I was on board with whatever the others were listening to. When you’re a skinny fifteen year old wearing a woman’s undergarment and mascara, and a six foot guy in all black leather is smoking directly into your face and telling you Cradle of Filth are the best band in the world, sometimes you bite your tongue and nod. So, here you go, enjoy: <strong>Cradle of Filth: ‘Forest Whispers My Name’</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-a-song-youre-currently-listening-to\">10. A song you&rsquo;re currently listening to</h3>\n<p>Oh shoot, so many options. Plus I feel an obligation to try and rescue this (very uneven) playlist from the clutches of Dani Filth.

				"content_text": "This was a suggestion from a friend, based upon the format of the podcast [*Teenage Mixtape*](https://shows.acast.com/teenagemixtape), wherein guests name a track for each of 10 criteria: \n\n1 — The first single you bought  \n2 — The first gig you went to  \n3 — A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents  \n4 — A song that reminds you of a teenage crush  \n5 — A song that reminds you of your partner (or an ex)  \n6 — A song that you wish you could play on guitar  \n7 — A song that you hope never to hear again  \n8 — A guilty pleasure  \n9 — The opposite of a guilty pleasure (ie. an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)  \n10 — A song you're listening to currently  \n\nSo here we go, the most uneven playlist I think I've ever made, with liner notes below.  \n<br>\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/gb/playlist/teenage-mixtape/pl.u-V98N9UWdvk5\"></iframe>\n\n### 1. First single you ever bought\n**Whitney Houston: ‘I Will Always Love You’** — I can’t swear to this being the absolute first single I bought, but it’s the first I *remember* buying. It would have been during the song’s 23-week run on the UK chart between November 1992 and April 1993, and I distinctly recall that my two purchases from the Hereford branch of Our Price that day were this single, and the *Love Symbol* album by Prince & the New Power Generation. \n\nThis is obviously a flawless vocal performance by Houston, of whom my dad was a fan but to whom I paid too little attention into my 30s. (Both *Whitney Houston* (1985) and *Whitney* (1987) recently warranted re-listens when assessing my favourite records of the 1980s.) \n\nIronically: I prefer the Dolly Parton original of this song these days.  \nDouble ironically: I’ve never seen *The Bodyguard*!\n\n### 2. The first gig you ever went to\n**M People: ‘Don’t Look Any Further’** — St David’s Hall, Cardiff. 1994? ‘Moving On Up’ and ‘Search for the Hero’ had the radio ubiquity, but whenever my dad would play the album, it was this song that captured my imagination. It is, as they say, still a bop. \n\nIn keeping with the previous track, my preference these days is for the Dennis Edwards original principally because of [its bassline](https://youtu.be/E7t8eoA_1jQ), and in spite of its [mind-bendingly bad music video](https://youtu.be/CH3rx8LhrQo). \n\n### 3. A song that reminds you of (one or both of) your parents\n**The Carpenters: ‘Top of the World’** — I may not have agreed to this if I’d known it would lead to floods of tears. I haven’t played this since my mum’s funeral, and I will never not think of her when I hear anything by The Carpenters. On a related note, this is why art is so very important: it provides intangible, permanent connection to things that we’ve otherwise lost, and a means through which to feel and express things we otherwise aren’t sure how to. \n\n### 4. A song that reminds you of a teenage crush\n**Portishead: ‘Glory Box’** — my first relationship that lasted more than a couple of months was with a very sweet, tomboyish girl. A few of our friendship group were very into Portishead’s first record, but I remember distinctly that she connected deeply with this particular song. Somehow it made more sense to me after she broke our relationship off, and began seeing a girl.  \n\n### 5. A song that reminds you of your partner\n**The White Stripes: ‘The Air Near My Fingers’** — My partner recently estimated that I spend 70% of my time thinking about food, and the rest thinking about her. Those percentages are wrong, but the sentiment isn’t. As such I don’t really need *reminding* of her, but here’s the song I associate most acutely with our early relationship. *Elephant* was the record that soundtracked a lot of what you might call our courtship, and this song in particular – with its refrain: “I get nervous when she comes around” – is 100% tied up with what it felt like getting to know her, and falling in love with her. \n\n### 6. A song that you wish you could play on guitar\n**Prince’s contribution to ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps’ from the 2004 Rock Hall of Fame induction ceremony** — I can’t play any songs on guitar, so I’m shooting for [the heavens](https://youtu.be/6SFNW5F8K9Y) on the understanding that if I could play this, I could play anything else I darn well pleased. I honestly can’t think of another single piece of guitar playing that is this transcendent. If I dedicated the rest of my life solely to learning this one guitar part I honestly don’t think I would ever get there. And even if I did, I still wouldn’t be able to [make guitars magically disappear](https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/tom-petty-and-others-tell-the-story-behind-princes-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-solo) into thin air. \n\nSide note: my second choice is Prince’s performance of [‘Purple Rain’](https://youtu.be/7NN3gsSf-Ys) at the 2007 Super Bowl. \n\n### 7. A song that you hope never to hear again\n**Foghat: ‘Slow Ride’** — Firstly, this isn’t a good song. It’s a bad song. But there are other bad songs of its calibre: ‘House of the Rising Sun’, ‘The Girl from Ipanema’, and ‘Hotel California’ could all disappear from the Earth today and I’d be quite happy never to hear them ever again. I’m choosing the Foghat track for one specific reason: I must have listened to it upwards of 100 times, sometimes ~20 times in a row, whilst trying to 5-star it on *Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock* (which I never did). The song sucks. Please erase it from existence.\n\n### 8. A guilty pleasure\nThis is the first tough one; I don’t really feel any guilt about taking pleasure in art. I’ll tell anyone who will listen that Madonna’s ‘Borderline’ (*Immaculate Collection* Remix (1990)) is my favourite song. Would you like to hear about why Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Cut to the Feeling’ is a masterpiece? Do you want to discuss how Meatloaf’s 12 minute rock opera classic ‘I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)’ is, if anything, too short? \n\nHonestly, I feel more reticence naming My Chemical Romance’s *The Black Parade* as my favourite album because it carries all sorts of connotations with which I don’t entirely associate. But do I feel guilty? No your honour, I do not. \n\nSo here’s the best I’ve got: **Michael Jackson: ‘Leave Me Alone’** — my favourite song by an artist I adored in the formative years of my music listening, and defended vociferously in the midst of allegations against him in the mid 90s. The music is still very special to me today, but that relationship is — obviously — more complicated now, and I’m not as firmly in the habit of loudly proclaiming my love of Michael Jackson as I once was.\n\n### 9. The opposite of a guilty pleasure (i.e., an artist/song you didn’t like but pretended to like to look cool)  \nI’m glad this is framed in the past tense, because (as above) I’m not someone who feels any guilt about the art they do or don’t like. That wasn’t always the case, however! \n\nIn the mid-to-late 90s I had a circle of friends that were primarily into metal. I certainly loved a good number of bands under that label (Metallica, Sepultura, Korn et al) but for the most part my tastes paddled out of the shallow end to only chest-deep water. I was the grunge kid of the group really, but despite that being evidenced by my wearing petticoats and tights to club nights, for some reason I felt the need to at least pretend that I was on board with whatever the others were listening to.

So, here you go, enjoy: **Cradle of Filth: ‘Forest Whispers My Name’**. \n\n### 10. A song you're currently listening to\nOh shoot, so many options. Plus I feel an obligation to try and rescue this (very uneven) playlist from the clutches of Dani Filth. Let’s keep it simple: my favourite song from 2020 at the time of writing. Kill ‘em Selena: **Selena Gomez: ‘Dance Again’**\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As visitors to this site may know, my friend James and I have a ritual of exchanging &lsquo;Top 20&rsquo; lists of our favourite albums at the end of each year. (All of those can be found <a href=\"/thelists\">here</a>.) Since this year marks the <em>twentieth</em> anniversary of that tradition, we decided to branch out a little and add in some additional mid-year lists. So here&rsquo;s the first of two, listing my favourite 20 films.</p>\n<p>This is the result of a lot of brainstorming, shortlisting, and hand-wringing. This list is firmly timestamped <strong>20 June 2020</strong>; positions are mutable, and there are 100 movies tied for the number 21 spot, any one of which could sneak on here on the right day.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I approached this as a fan of <em>Drive</em> (2011) and someone who pulled a confused face through most of <em>Only God Forgives</em> (2013). Happily <em>The Neon Demon</em> took me on a ride that I won&rsquo;t soon forget. Alongside one other (in some respects curiously similar) film, this is the closest I get to horror on this list, but I have a hard time thinking of it that way.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This is a perfect example of a small, personal movie that transcends niche subject matter to feel universal. (See also <em>Rocky</em>). I could watch this 100 times just for JK Simmons&rsquo;s performance – one of the most compelling characters of modern cinema.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Famously this was a higher budget project with (even) more high profile stars attached, and then it fell apart. I cannot for the life of me imagine a version of this movie without these central performances, or the settings exactly as they are.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t Aronofsky&rsquo;s only appearance on this list, and with the notable exception of <em>Noah</em> (2014) he&rsquo;s possibly the director I feel most in tune with.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There&rsquo;s not much left to be said about <em>Rocky</em>. Even today it feels like lightning in a bottle.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The peaks of cinematic style over the last 30 years feature <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (1994), <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), and this film. Pitch perfect soundtrack, understated performances, beautiful camerawork, one of the best opening sequences ever. Re-watch it, I virtually guarantee it&rsquo;s even better than you remember.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Maybe, just maybe, the best central performance of my lifetime, and that&rsquo;s just one component of a masterful film. I find a new shot to marvel at on each re-watch, and Jonny Greenwood&rsquo;s score is jaw dropping all by itself.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Flash back to 8 year old Adam for whom his stuffed Roger Rabbit and the cardboard Benny the Cab in which it arrived were prized possessions. This is a magical movie entirely in love with movie magic at every level, and it remains an absolute pleasure.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I saw this on my 30th birthday at Curzon Soho and it absolutely stunned me. I was already an avowed Aronofsky fan by that point, but this film – which I read as an urgent female revision of <em>Fight Club</em> (1999) – locked him in as the most vital of working directors. (I wrote a review <a href=\"/blackswan\">here</a>.)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As with many people, one of the most formative films of my youth. I just about wore out the taped-from-TV copy that had an almost permanent home in our top-loading Betamax. Eventually this would lead me to Spielberg, then Coppola, then everything else!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>By the time I saw this I knew <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> inside out and back to front, and I was still blown away by the music of Tarantino&rsquo;s script. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the film&rsquo;s cultural impact, since it&rsquo;s now woven into the fabric of much that followed. For me too it remains a touchstone film that also happens to be a darn good time.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>An audacious masterpiece featuring a career best performance from Keaton, surrounded by other brilliant performances by Norton, Stone et al. It&rsquo;s smart, dark, funny, and the score is a part of the picture in a way I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt before. You could entirely lose the &lsquo;no cuts&rsquo; device and still have a wonderful film. As it stands it&rsquo;s also a profound piece of art about authenticity and performance.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We can argue about whether it&rsquo;s one film or two, but Tarantino&rsquo;s on my side so I&rsquo;ll win. This is the best picture by one of the most vital, inventive directors in cinema history. That it comes in the form of a funny, beautifully shot, blood-soaked martial arts epic is just a bonus to my way of thinking. No one has made a movie like this since; my fingers ache from having been crossed for so long at the prospect of the long-rumoured third instalment.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone was really ready for <em>The Matrix</em>, but I certainly wasn&rsquo;t. When it came out I was preoccupied checking the (janky, infant) web for anything I could learn about <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. Later that year, in what felt like the space of a week, I&rsquo;d have my mind blown by <em>Fight Club</em>, and my nerves shredded by <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. But it&rsquo;s <em>The Matrix</em> that changed everything. Its impact on wider culture is astounding, let alone what it did to action films, and it remains timelessly cool and perfectly structured to this day - honestly I don&rsquo;t think a movie has been released since that balances style and substance this well.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the most transcendent cinema-going experiences of my life. An unalloyed joy from beginning to end, with one of the most charming central performances imaginable. It&rsquo;s about growing up too slowly and falling behind and not fitting in and feeling completely adrift, and trying to make peace with it. Despite all the ways I&rsquo;m different to Frances, I&rsquo;ve rarely felt so seen in (or reassured by) a piece of art.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t born when <em>Close Encounters&hellip;</em> came out, and I was only an infant when <em>ET</em> was released. This was my Spielberg movie, and my first summer blockbuster. The first film for which I pored over every magazine article, collected stickers, bought the &lsquo;making of&rsquo; and &lsquo;art of&rsquo; books. It remains an example of perfectly crafted, immaculate cinema.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I enjoy a jump-scare-filled slasher movie as much as the next person, but nothing comes close to this for me in terms of inducing sheer dread. A masterpiece of mood setting and audience manipulation, with an unbelievable career-best central performance from Jennifer Lawrence. Aronofsky&rsquo;s use of his set — the way the house changes throughout — is spellbinding, and his pacing is superb. And the sheer audacity to go as far as this film goes is stunning. The most potent metaphor for the creative process imaginable.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I re-watch this every 2 February as though it were a religious holiday. Tonally flawless, with a Bill Murray performance for the ages. It does a remarkable job of getting to the human centre of its high concept premise. Ironically it remains endlessly re-watchable.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The best comedy ever made. Flawless script, flawless performances, and a sense of the world that is entirely its own. There are weirder Coens' movies; there are probably more inventive Coens' movies, but this is the one they will almost certainly never top. If I could only take one movie to a desert island, this might be it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Take a sci-fi concept, sprinkle in Greek myth, add Huey Lewis and the News&hellip; you&rsquo;re part way to making a flawless masterpiece of family cinema. Whether it&rsquo;s Zemeckis &amp; Bob Gale&rsquo;s script; Fox, Lloyd, and Thompson&rsquo;s performances; the soundtrack; the visual design, or (most likely) a combination of all those elements, the film is imbued with an undiminished warmth. (The recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/crdYIUdUOhc\">&lsquo;Reunited Apart&rsquo; episode</a> with the cast and crew is the best thing to come out of COVID-19 lockdown.)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For me personally this is the most awe &amp; wonder per foot of celluloid I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. AT-ATs; Yoda; the cave; &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; / &ldquo;I know&rdquo;; the duel on Cloud City; &ldquo;Luke, I am your father&rdquo;&hellip;. Absolutely unbeatable.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s only right for me to point out that I&rsquo;m aware this list is overwhelmingly populated by white men; in fact the Wachowskis &amp; Alejandro González Iñárritu are the only people here that fall outside of that category. Heck, Iñárritu &amp; Nicolas Winding Refn are the only directors from outside of the US!</p>\n<p>If this were a longer list you would see names like Kelly Reichardt, Sofia Coppola, Greta Gerwig, Olivier Assayas, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alfred Hitchcock, and Michel Gondry. The first Black person&rsquo;s name would likely be John Singleton, Steve McQueen, or Spike Lee. But you&rsquo;d also see a lot more white, American men. I hold my hand up: I can be faulted for having not watched widely enough. Additionally, there are certainly systemic forces at play in terms of the sheer number of films made by the one group, particularly during the period in which I was falling in love with cinema.</p>\n",

The Big Lebowski (1998)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Joel Coen</span></h3>\n\nThe best comedy ever made. Flawless script, flawless performances, and a sense of the world that is entirely its own. There are weirder Coens' movies; there are probably more inventive Coens' movies, but this is the one they will almost certainly never top. If I could only take one movie to a desert island, this might be it.\n\n<h3>2. Back to the Future (1985)  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Robert Zemeckis</span></h3>\n\nTake a sci-fi concept, sprinkle in Greek myth, add Huey Lewis and the News... you're part way to making a flawless masterpiece of family cinema. Whether it's Zemeckis & Bob Gale's script; Fox, Lloyd, and Thompson's performances; the soundtrack; the visual design, or (most likely) a combination of all those elements, the film is imbued with an undiminished warmth. (The recent ['Reunited Apart' episode](https://youtu.be/crdYIUdUOhc) with the cast and crew is the best thing to come out of COVID-19 lockdown.)\n\n<h3>1. Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back  <span style=\"color:#cfcfcf; font-size: 14px;\">dir. Irvin Kershner</span></h3>\n\nFor me personally this is the most awe & wonder per foot of celluloid I've ever encountered. AT-ATs; Yoda; the cave; \"I love you\" / \"I know\"; the duel on Cloud City; \"Luke, I am your father\".... Absolutely unbeatable.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nIt's only right for me to point out that I'm aware this list is overwhelmingly populated by white men; in fact the Wachowskis & Alejandro González Iñárritu are the only people here that fall outside of that category. Heck, Iñárritu & Nicolas Winding Refn are the only directors from outside of the US!\n\nIf this were a longer list you would see names like Kelly Reichardt, Sofia Coppola, Greta Gerwig, Olivier Assayas, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alfred Hitchcock, and Michel Gondry. The first Black person's name would likely be John Singleton, Steve McQueen, or Spike Lee. But you'd also see a lot more white, American men. I hold my hand up: I can be faulted for having not watched widely enough. Additionally, there are certainly systemic forces at play in terms of the sheer number of films made by the one group, particularly during the period in which I was falling in love with cinema.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Over the weekend I finished reading Stephen King’s 2013 novel <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, and then caught up with the film adaptation from 2019. Here are some (relatively spoiler free) thoughts in bullet form.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s brave to return to material this well regarded.</strong> <em>The Shining</em> (1977) remains one of the top-tier novels of King’s long career, which makes <em>Doctor Sleep</em> a huge gamble. The stakes are far higher here than for any one of the (very few) other direct sequels he’s written, such as continuations of the Bill Hodges story, or <em>Black House</em> (2001, alongside Peter Straub).</p>\n<p><strong>It’s a very different novel to its precursor.</strong> I haven’t looked too deep into it, but I gather the backlash to <em>Doctor Sleep</em> on publication was that it wasn’t <em>The Shining</em>. And it sure isn’t. King’s not interested in retreading old ground, and he flips the claustrophobia, the isolation, and even the power dynamics of his decades-old classic on their heads for the sequel. There are familiar thematic elements – such as addiction as metaphor for possession – but those too are inverted: Danny isn’t his father, and the novel’s villains have as much to lose as its protagonists do.</p>\n<p><strong>You can’t ride two horses at the same time.</strong> I don’t envy Mike Flanagan the task of adapting this book for film. Readers of <em>The Shining</em> who have also seen Kubrick’s 1980 film will know that there are significant plot differences; in particular the two versions have very different endings. Flanagan takes on the task of both bringing the new book to screen, and producing a sequel to Kubrick’s film – and you simply can’t do both. He sure tries, but the last act of the movie indulges in exactly the sort of heavy-handed nostalgia that King avoids in the novel. Flanagan is aware that a majority of his audience will know the cinematic version of <em>The Shining</em> better than they know the source work, and he plays to it with mixed results.</p>\n<p><strong>The medium shapes the story in interesting ways.</strong> As a huge fan of Donna Tartt’s <em>The Goldfinch</em> (another 2013 novel), I had high hopes for what turned out to be a serviceable but uninspired film adaptation of that book. Watching the movie version was a lesson in all the many things that can be done on the page that just can’t be translated to film. I found the same thing at play with <em>Doctor Sleep</em>. At 150+ minutes it’s not short, and yet it’s far <em>too</em> short to get to know its cast of characters anything like as well as one does when reading the novel. I suppose that’s par for the course; a book will always be better than the film of it, at least in most respects. I was struck in particular by one effect that the streamlining for screen had on the story here. The result is a work that’s strangely cruel to some of its characters: there are no fewer than three protagonists that make it the end of the novel just fine, but who meet (sometimes gruesome) ends on screen. These are characters who certainly don’t need to die, except that it would complicate the film to have them hanging around.</p>\n<p><strong>King’s ending is better.</strong> As might be clear by now, I much preferred the novel to the film. (The latter isn’t bad, and I can see myself watching and enjoying it again in a few years’ time; perhaps when the novel is less fresh to me, I’ll be able to come to Flanagan’s movie on its own terms.) But the starkest contrast of all, as with the two versions of <em>The Shining</em>, is between the two endings. As noted above, Flanagan’s seems needlessly cruel, where King allows his characters more grace. Strangely, and perhaps purposefully, there’s a way to read the ending of <em>Doctor Sleep</em> the film as an attempt to restore the ending of <em>The Shining</em> the novel. To my mind, at least at the moment, it doesn’t work as well as King’s more hopeful ending, and particularly his perfectly pitched final chapter.</p>\n",

				"title": "The List 2019",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-caterina-barbieri--ecstatic-computation\">20. Caterina Barbieri — <em>Ecstatic Computation</em></h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://caterinabarbieri.com\">her (neo-GeoCities) website</a>, Barbieri ‘explores the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations in music, by investigating the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers to draw severe, complex geometries in time and space’. That’s a better explanation than I can offer as to how her music operates. Often sparse it still has the ability to surprise through the unexpected ways in which the rhythms play around and off each other. The 10-plus minutes of opener ‘Fantas’ is a sonic world all its own; dark echoes give birth to bright synths, which in turn make way for mellower, fuzzier tones. It’s a headphone album right down to its sonic DNA, and when I made time to listen to it that way I enjoyed it enormously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-chai--punk\">19. CHAI — <em>Punk</em></h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Nisennenmondai infiltrated the ranks of Go! Team, I have your answer. CHAI is an all-female Japanese pop-rock ensemble who make one heck of a racket. I have very little idea what’s going on in most of these tracks – the lyrics are a mix of Japanese and heavily-accented English – but it never matters. Killer bass lines conspire with super-catchy synths and a combination of live and programmed drums to make the kind of 32 minute record that leaves you desperate to find out what this all looks and sounds like live. It’s dayglo bright and not at all nuanced, and the weirdness of understanding only every fifth lyric never really goes away, but joy and enthusiasm just radiates from it in waves. And in 2019, there’s nothing more punk than that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-thom-yorke--anima\">18. Thom Yorke — <em>ANIMA</em></h3>\n<p>Perhaps it’s misleading, but increasingly it feels possible to discern what each member of Radiohead brings to their collaborative project by examining their solo output. Ed O’Brien’s recent single ‘Brasil’ starts out folksy and grounded, before being lifted (by Colin Greenwood’s bass no less) into a different place: somewhere looser, groovier, and more danceable. Jony Greenwood’s film scores have given a glimpse of the expanse and complexity of his musical thinking. And Thom Yorke keeps making weird, dark electronica records.</p>\n<p><em>ANIMA</em> feels even more insular to me than previous releases, trapped in its own head, or else providing a release for someone who otherwise would be. It’s still seductive, and beautifully crafted, but despite knowing I was holding its composer to a higher standard, I couldn’t help but note the lack of an ‘Analyse’, ‘Harrowdown Hill’, or ‘A Brain in a Bottle’ here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-charly-bliss--young-enough\">17. Charly Bliss — <em>Young Enough</em></h3>\n<p>You might remember Charly Bliss’s debut (<em>Guppy</em>) from my 2017 list, or the highlight of the album, ‘Ruby’, as one of my songs of that year. Their follow up is more of the same: bubblegum-adjacent melodies and an arch vocal delivery of largely diaristic lyrics. It’s fun stuff, and catchy in a lot of the right places. The playing has tightened up a little bit, and it feels as though a decision has been taken to polish the production a bit more than previously. There are still loose ends and plenty of energy, but it doesn’t feel as raw as before. Even so, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of a second helping of Charly Bliss. One listen through opener ‘Blown to Bits’ will tell you whether it might also be your thing. (PS. That track opens with a synth chord so close to the one that opens Weezer’s 1996 b-side ‘I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams’ that I refuse to believe it’s coincidence.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-anderson-paak--ventura\">16. Anderson .Paak — <em>Ventura</em></h3>\n<p>Anderson .Paak is an artist I’ve struggled to get a handle on. But, after dipping into 2016’s <em>Yes Lawd!</em>, and (unwittingly) skipping 2018’s <em>Oxnard</em>, I immediately vibed with the latter’s sister album: <em>Ventura</em>.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Come Home’ is like an extended title sequence, featuring some gold standard Andre 3000 bars. Then it’s on to the soulful relationship therapy of ‘Make it Better’, pairing Anderson’s rich vocals with those of none other than Smokey Robinson. From there its warm, honey-toned production, smart lyrics, and laid back beats all the way, through lead single ‘King James’ all the way until ‘What Can We Do?’ closes the record with the best Nate Dogg feature since ’21 Questions’ (2002).</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-beirut--gallipoli\">15. Beirut — <em>Gallipoli</em></h3>\n<p>Beirut is one of those bands that have long been on the periphery of my awareness, and which I knew I should be paying more attention to. Now, as with Spoon’s <em>They Want My Soul</em> (2014) and Low’s <em>Double Negative</em> (2018), a record has finally captured my full attention. Gallipoli is manifestly the work of creators very comfortable in their artistic skins. Lyrically and tonally melancholy, but musically expansive and exploratory, there’s a warmth at its heart that never dims even in its darker moments. Album high point ‘Gauze für Zah’ is an exemplar of the record’s broad sonic palate, Zach Condon’s drifting, melodic vocal, and the manner in which Beirut are often content to let compositions develop at an unforced pace rather than force a strict structure.</p>\n<p>This won’t be for everyone, but it was a record unlike many others I heard this year, and I was grateful to it for bringing Beirut more squarely into focus for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-james-blake--assume-form\">14. James Blake — <em>Assume Form</em></h3>\n<p>This album came along so early in the year (18 Jan) that I wasn’t sure it would stick around for me, but I’ve played it fairly regularly all year. I know a lot of people call out Blake’s voice as a highlight of his work; I find it very effective (particularly in its higher register), but I would also take an album full of his giddy, kaleidoscopic sonic compositions without the vocals. In fact, the better vocal performances on this record belong to Travis Scott on album highlight ‘Mile High’, and ROSALÍA on the haunting, off-kilter ‘Barefoot in the Park’.</p>\n<p>The tempo remains staid throughout, but there’s a range of modes here, between which Blake switches without missing a beat. I find him to be an intriguing musician, and one I can’t quite place comfortably. Somewhere on an archipelago off the coast of electronica, he’s just doing his own thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-foals--part-1-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost\">13. Foals — <em>Part 1 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost</em></h3>\n<p>I had Foals’ debut, <em>Antidotes</em>, on release in 2008 and I was ready to file them away with other art-math-rock bands like Klaxons, whose debut (<em>Myths of the Near Future</em>) I had admired but not loved the year before. It’s been a welcome surprise to watch Foals grow, and their sonic palate complicate and evolve to something that I can only describe as Biffy Clyro covering The Mars Volta. <em>What Went Down</em> (2015) very nearly made my top 20 of that year, largely on the strength of its unassailably huge title track, and now we’re here.</p>\n<p>Double albums are always enormously ambitious projects, and by virtue of the two halves having been released separately I have to consider them individually. You won’t find Part 2 of <em>ENSWBL</em> on this list: its late-October release date hasn’t allowed me time to digest it enough. Part 1 has remained on heavy rotation since March, however, and despite that I feel like there’s still plenty more in there for me to discover.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-tyler-the-creator--igor\">12. Tyler, The Creator — <em>IGOR</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not sure where to start with this record. The palate is hip-hop infused with jazz touches, soul, gospel, and funk. The record opens with an extended synth tone that keys you to the texture of what follows, but what follows is a shifting thing. First track proper, ‘EARFQUAKE’ was originally written for (but rejected by) Justin Bieber, so Tyler has turned it into a downbeat pean that has shrugged itself free of anything like traditional song structure. And once you’re on the ride, you have little choice but to strap in and enjoy it; this is an album in the proper sense of the word - obviously intended to be experienced as a whole. A moody melange of twilight production, treated vocals that see Tyler pushing his singing voice as much as he raps, songs that ‘end’ and then continue… twice.</p>\n<p>Above all else it’s the sheer inventiveness of the song structures, and the compelling production that kept me coming back. I didn’t hear a finer hip-hop record this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-wand--laughing-matter\">11. Wand — <em>Laughing Matter</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve long wondered, sometimes aloud, why no one else makes music that sounds anything like Radiohead. My first impression upon hearing <em>Laughing Matter</em> was that Wand are also at least at the same dance, even if they’re moving a bit differently to the Oxford quintet.</p>\n<p>Cory Hanson’s soft, tuneful vocals; Lee Landey’s inquisitive bass lines; Evan Burrows’s restless, inventive percussion… it all adds up to something very impressive. Add in Robert Cody’s brilliantly judged guitar - always happy to play a supporting role that makes each track better - and Sofie Arreguin’s synths adding colour and sonic texture, and you have an album that blooms into something genuinely special.</p>\n<p>Aside from the, admittedly terrible, none-more-psych-rock album cover, the only disappointment is that the track ‘High Planes Drifter’ isn’t a cover of the 1989 Beastie Boys cut.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-the-regrettes--how-do-you-love\">10. The Regrettes — <em>How Do You Love?</em></h3>\n<p>I just looked back at my list from 2017 and apparently The Regrettes’ debut (<em>Feel Your Feelings Fool</em>) didn’t make the final cut. That surprised me, because in retrospect it’s one of the albums from that year that has had the most staying power for me. And now I have this excellent follow-up to file right alongside it.</p>\n<p>At heart the record is nothing more complicated than a set of relationship songs (from love songs, to break up songs and everything in between), all laid out in frontwoman Lydia Night’s smoky, bluesy vocal, underpinned by soulful bass lines and bright percussion. With the sound having evolved a hair away from the debut’s punk notes the guitar is a little bit pop and a little bit classic 50s rock n’ roll. I fully expect to be playing album highlights ‘California Friends’, ‘ I Dare You’ and ‘Pumpkin’ for years to come.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-floating-points-crush\">9. Floating Points — <em>Crush</em></h3>\n<p>My only other touchstone for the term ‘floating points’ is a measurement of computing power: FLOPS, or floating point operations per second. And to me it feels as though there’s something apt about the name chosen by neuroscientist &amp; epigeneticist Sam Shepherd for his musical project. Intricate, busy beats vie with dense, shifting loops for the listener’s attention; the listening experience is akin to visiting a gallery of impressionist visual art - sometimes bewildering, at points confrontational, but constantly intriguing and compelling.</p>\n<p>There are more easygoing moments, such as ‘Anasickmodular’ with its house beat buried deep in the mix under layers of shifting sonic sands. And there are danceable moments like ‘LesAlpx’ with its room-sized bass. It’s a record that ends up feeling far more than the sum of its parts, and one I’ll likely sit down with again and again when I have a good pair of headphones to hand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-fennesz--agora\">8. Fennesz — <em>Agora</em></h3>\n<p>It was an odd year for me and electronic / ambient music. I heard a lot of stuff I liked, but nothing quite hit me in the way LPs by Nicolas Jaar, Takeleave, Shigeto, Loscil, and Submerse etc. have in years past. Agora is the highest placing such album on this year’s list, and the closest thing I encountered to an experience like some of those listed above.</p>\n<p>Agora is actually more toward the ambient end of the spectrum. Really what you’re getting here is a quartet of what I’ve spoken of in the past as aural landscapes. This kind of sonic topography has only grown in appeal for me over the years, and Fennesz is working in the same mould as Ryuichi Sakamoto and William Basinski. When I took the time to spend with it properly, I loved it. At other times it acted as slightly odd background music to several meals.</p>\n<p>My end of year Music Replay lists Four Tet amongst my most played artists of 2019, and his studio output this year was a pair of singles. Which is to say that, unable to find truly stellar new electronica, I fell back on old favourites. Fennesz, at least, gave me something new and substantial to immerse myself in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-vampire-weekend--father-of-the-bride\">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Father of the Bride</em></h3>\n<p>Without necessarily knowing it, I’ve been waiting for this record for six years. I don’t have a copy of my lists as far back as Vampire Weekend’s eponymous 2008 debut, but I’m guessing it placed high. That album – featuring the perennial modern classics ‘A-Punk’, ‘Oxford Comma’ et al – was the most effortlessly cool arrival on the musical stage since The Strokes’ in 2001. Two years later, <em>Contra</em> took that model and gave it a twist on tracks like the almost-too-jaunty ‘Holiday’ and the almost-too-manic ‘Cousins’. When that record placed seventh on my 2010 list I noted how pleasant a surprise it was that the band had managed to recapture the magic of their debut and replicate its infectious energy.</p>\n<p>And then <em>Modern Vampires of the City</em> (2013) threw me for a loop. A little darker, quite a bit stranger, more… mature, if that’s the right word. Vampire Weekend had shifted gears on me, and despite the fact that the album still features perhaps my favourite of the band’s songs (‘Diane Young’), I wasn’t sure how to make the transition. In a weird way, <em>Father of the Bride</em> has returned me to its precursor with new admiration. What the band began six years ago they deliver in spades on this year’s record.</p>\n<p>Lead single ‘This Life’ is the sort of song that sounds like it always existed, just waiting for someone to intone the magic words to bring it into being. Ezra Koenig’s always smart lyricism does the trick, and we receive another gem of a pop song as a result.</p>\n<p>But Vampire Weekend are reaching for more here. It’s a smart decision to pair Koenig’s (still immediately recognisable) voice with a female guest, and Danielle Haim proves a perfect partner. It’s just one of several signs that the band feel assured enough at this stage to relax away from 3-minute pop-rock jewels, and explore other avenues. At 18 tracks and an hour of running time, <em>Father of the Bride</em> gives them plenty of room to do so, and they don’t waste a moment of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-toro-y-moi--outer-peace\">6. Toro y Moi — <em>Outer Peace</em></h3>\n<p>Third time on the list in a row for Chaz Bear’s one man hazy vibe machine. In 2015 <em>What For?</em> made 4th, and two years later / ago <em>Boo Boo</em> sat at 13th. In all honesty, there’s not too much to tell the albums apart; if there are musical evolutions here they’re minimal. I for one am quite happy, however, to have one of these records every couple of years – laid back beats, warm, fuzzy production, and Bear’s easygoing vocal delivery remain a tonic.</p>\n<p>‘Ordinary Pleasure’ is an effortlessly catchy celebration of art and life in general (and the video’s fun); ‘Who I Am’ is a danceable minimal gem; and ‘Miss Me’ is all space and mood. But the album’s high point for me remains ‘Freelance’, with it’s weird Animal Collective-inspired vocal tic, and typical TyM lyrics mixing the prosaic &amp; profound:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals<br>\nI can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old<br>\nI can’t hear you, maybe you could change your tone<br>\nPeople tend to listen when they see your soul</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"5-jimmy-eat-world--surviving\">5. Jimmy Eat World — <em>Surviving</em></h3>\n<p>OK, here’s the formula: first you make sure you have one of the year’s best album covers, then you sequence the album so that you start with a statement-of-intent title track, then you start that track with one of the most Jimmy Eat World guitar riffs imaginable. That’s how you kick off a rock record that will get my attention in 2019, and it’s also how you make your return to this list after more than a decade. Don’t get me wrong, 2016’s <em>Integrity Blues</em> wasn’t a bad record, and there were things to like on <em>Invented</em> (2010) (I barely remember <em>Damage</em> (2013) however; I’m not 100% sure that album exists). But it’s been a long time since Jimmy Eat World made a record that felt genuinely great, and the excellent news is that <em>Surviving</em> is as good an album as they’ve ever made. I still play <em>Clarity</em> (1999) &amp; <em>Bleed American</em> (2001) a fair bit, and I can see myself adding this LP to that rotation.</p>\n<p>Take, as just one example, ‘All the Way (Stay)’ - the kind of heartfelt, keenly urgent rock song this band are uniquely capable of writing on their best days. This is a record that suggests those are not all behind them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-sigrid--sucker-punch\">4. Sigrid — <em>Sucker Punch</em></h3>\n<p>Last year Robyn dropped an album called <em>Honey</em> that didn’t make my list, but has grown on me quite a bit since. I mention that here because on <em>Sucker Punch</em> Sigrid is working side by side with her Scandinavian sister in the dance-infused electro-pop mines, and boy is she digging out some jewels.</p>\n<p>The album’s title track is a crystal clear, simple slice of joy. ‘Mine Right Now’ feigns innocence for its first 30 seconds and then hits you right in whatever part of your brain responds to synth-driven anthems. And those are just the first two of a dozen near-flawless, glittering pop gems. There are tracks like ‘Don’t Kill My Vibe’ and ‘Level Up’ that are unafraid to dive into more personal, emotional lyricism, but I dare you not to sing along after you’ve heard them a couple of times.</p>\n<p>There are no tricks here, just an assured, lilting vocal style and a cache of catchy tunes produced as simply as you like. That will get you in the top five only if you bring the songwriting goods, and Sigrid’s basket is full. More please.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-madison-cunningham--who-are-you-now\">3. Madison Cunningham — <em>Who Are You Now</em></h3>\n<p>This was an album that captured me right from the first listen: simple arrangements — rooted in country / folk / bluegrass — and a voice that sounds like clear running water. I was reminded of the stark beauty of Laura Marling’s debut, with a shade of something sharper, à la Jenny Lewis (see eg. the development of ‘Song in My Head’ for a good example of the mix).</p>\n<p>There’s a lightness and a freshness to the album that belies some of its lyrical weight, with Cunningham’s voice effortlessly somersaulting over (deceptively complex) acoustic guitar. ‘Something To Believe In’ features an expressive piano arrangement as an exception to prove the rule. This lightness of touch mixed with often stark emotion has secured the record a Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Americana Album’, which feels richly deserved even if I’m not sure of the category definition.</p>\n<p>Released in summer, this has really come into its own for me as the days got colder and the evenings longer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-jade-bird--jade-bird\">2. Jade Bird — <em>Jade Bird</em></h3>\n<p>First you have to get over the voice: it sounds like it’s that of a seasoned folk-rock trooper who has been on the road since the 70s with a pack of Marlboros tucked in her sleeve, but it actually belongs to a 22 year old from Northumberland.</p>\n<p>Once you’re past that you can enjoy some of the most enjoyable, well crafted voice-and-a-guitar songs I’ve heard in quite some time. Like a louder, brasher Laura Marling who sounds like she might have a knife in her boot, Bird lays out beautiful, impassioned stories of love and loss one after another as though it’s easy to do. The voice <em>or</em> the songwriting would likely place this record on this List, but the combination has it at number two because it’s nothing short of magical.</p>\n<p>Sliding up four notes in the final moments of ‘Side Effects’, shifting from fragile to indomitable on ‘My Motto’, or somehow conveying both regret and strength in the same line: “Are you sure you wanna do this now?” (‘Ruins’). There’s also a key change on that last song (in fact the album’s opener) which just about kills me every time. And those are just the first examples that come to mind.</p>\n<p>‘Uh Huh’ &amp; ‘Good at It’ are a kind of one-two punch of an update to Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, and in fact the comparison feels apt. This is top tier songwriting and one of the most compelling deliveries I’ve heard in some time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-taylor-swift--lover\">1. Taylor Swift — <em>Lover</em></h3>\n<p>It seems to me that each of the past few years when putting together this list I’ve mounted a case for one straight-ahead pop record or another. (Tove Styrke’s <em>Sway</em> (#13 last year) being the most recent example.) It felt inevitable that at some point one of those records was going to plant its flag this deep in my heart. Top spot this year goes to the record I played more than any other, by the artist I played more than any other.\nAccording to Music I’ve listened to 1,155 hours’ of music this year. That’s 143 different artists, and 186 different releases. And yet seven out of my top ten most listened-to tracks, including the entire top five, come from one record. And I’m not nearly done playing any of them. In reverse order then:</p>\n<p>• ‘I Forgot that You Existed’: the album opener is the sound of someone reclaiming their power with as assured a light touch as you can imagine. A sparse musical bed over which Swift’s voice floats, saying goodbye to something she doesn’t need anymore.</p>\n<p>• ‘The Man’: an upbeat synth-pop masterpiece by way of feminist anthem, and like every song here entirely impossible not to sing along to every time you hear it.</p>\n<p>• ‘The Archer’: a downbeat synth-pop masterpiece showcasing Swift at her most emotionally vulnerable as it builds to something more powerful.</p>\n<p>• ‘You Need to Calm Down’: instantly ranks alongside my favourite pop tracks of all time. The five layered “uh ohs” of the bridge have pretty much been stuck in my head all year. A beautiful, righteous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>• ‘Lover’: my most-listened to song of 2019 is an exquisite, tender ballad about holding close that which you love.</p>\n<p>And then there’s ‘Paper Rings’, ‘ME!’, ‘I Think He Knows’….</p>\n<p>It’s kind of fitting that it’s Swift who takes this giant leap for pop music kind and claims top spot on my List. I’ve been increasingly impressed with her as a cultural figure since she handled the whole Kanye West / VMAs debacle with such grace. It was Swift’s protest that single-handedly got Apple to agree to pay artists when their music was listened to during the free trial period of the Music streaming service. And most recently she has been both an increasingly vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and an increasingly visible opponent of industry practices that place record companies entirely in control of artists’ work.</p>\n<p>So, alongside becoming the most decorated performer in the history of the American Music Awards, and being heralded their ‘Artist of the Decade’, here’s another trophy for Taylor’s shelf: she made my favourite album of 2019.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Caterina Barbieri — *Ecstatic Computation*\n\nAccording to [her (neo-GeoCities) website](https://caterinabarbieri.com), Barbieri ‘explores the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations in music, by investigating the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of sequencers to draw severe, complex geometries in time and space’. That’s a better explanation than I can offer as to how her music operates. Often sparse it still has the ability to surprise through the unexpected ways in which the rhythms play around and off each other. The 10-plus minutes of opener ‘Fantas’ is a sonic world all its own; dark echoes give birth to bright synths, which in turn make way for mellower, fuzzier tones. It’s a headphone album right down to its sonic DNA, and when I made time to listen to it that way I enjoyed it enormously.\n\n\n###  19. CHAI — *Punk*\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Nisennenmondai infiltrated the ranks of Go! Team, I have your answer. CHAI is an all-female Japanese pop-rock ensemble who make one heck of a racket. I have very little idea what’s going on in most of these tracks – the lyrics are a mix of Japanese and heavily-accented English – but it never matters. Killer bass lines conspire with super-catchy synths and a combination of live and programmed drums to make the kind of 32 minute record that leaves you desperate to find out what this all looks and sounds like live. It’s dayglo bright and not at all nuanced, and the weirdness of understanding only every fifth lyric never really goes away, but joy and enthusiasm just radiates from it in waves. And in 2019, there’s nothing more punk than that.\n\n\n###  18. Thom Yorke — *ANIMA*\n\nPerhaps it’s misleading, but increasingly it feels possible to discern what each member of Radiohead brings to their collaborative project by examining their solo output. Ed O’Brien’s recent single ‘Brasil’ starts out folksy and grounded, before being lifted (by Colin Greenwood’s bass no less) into a different place: somewhere looser, groovier, and more danceable. Jony Greenwood’s film scores have given a glimpse of the expanse and complexity of his musical thinking. And Thom Yorke keeps making weird, dark electronica records.\n\n*ANIMA* feels even more insular to me than previous releases, trapped in its own head, or else providing a release for someone who otherwise would be. It’s still seductive, and beautifully crafted, but despite knowing I was holding its composer to a higher standard, I couldn’t help but note the lack of an ‘Analyse’, ‘Harrowdown Hill’, or ‘A Brain in a Bottle’ here.\n\n###  17. Charly Bliss — *Young Enough*\n\nYou might remember Charly Bliss’s debut (*Guppy*) from my 2017 list, or the highlight of the album, ‘Ruby’, as one of my songs of that year. Their follow up is more of the same: bubblegum-adjacent melodies and an arch vocal delivery of largely diaristic lyrics. It’s fun stuff, and catchy in a lot of the right places. The playing has tightened up a little bit, and it feels as though a decision has been taken to polish the production a bit more than previously. There are still loose ends and plenty of energy, but it doesn’t feel as raw as before. Even so, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of a second helping of Charly Bliss. One listen through opener ‘Blown to Bits’ will tell you whether it might also be your thing. (PS. That track opens with a synth chord so close to the one that opens Weezer’s 1996 b-side ‘I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams’ that I refuse to believe it’s coincidence.)\n\n###  16. Anderson .Paak — *Ventura*\n\nAnderson .Paak is an artist I’ve struggled to get a handle on. But, after dipping into 2016’s *Yes Lawd!*, and (unwittingly) skipping 2018’s *Oxnard*, I immediately vibed with the latter’s sister album: *Ventura*.\n\nOpener ‘Come Home’ is like an extended title sequence, featuring some gold standard Andre 3000 bars. Then it’s on to the soulful relationship therapy of ‘Make it Better’, pairing Anderson’s rich vocals with those of none other than Smokey Robinson. From there its warm, honey-toned production, smart lyrics, and laid back beats all the way, through lead single ‘King James’ all the way until ‘What Can We Do?’ closes the record with the best Nate Dogg feature since ’21 Questions’ (2002).\n\n###  15. Beirut — *Gallipoli*\n\nBeirut is one of those bands that have long been on the periphery of my awareness, and which I knew I should be paying more attention to. Now, as with Spoon’s *They Want My Soul* (2014) and Low’s *Double Negative* (2018), a record has finally captured my full attention. Gallipoli is manifestly the work of creators very comfortable in their artistic skins. Lyrically and tonally melancholy, but musically expansive and exploratory, there’s a warmth at its heart that never dims even in its darker moments. Album high point ‘Gauze für Zah’ is an exemplar of the record’s broad sonic palate, Zach Condon’s drifting, melodic vocal, and the manner in which Beirut are often content to let compositions develop at an unforced pace rather than force a strict structure.\n\nThis won’t be for everyone, but it was a record unlike many others I heard this year, and I was grateful to it for bringing Beirut more squarely into focus for me.\n\n###  14. James Blake — *Assume Form*\n\nThis album came along so early in the year (18 Jan) that I wasn’t sure it would stick around for me, but I’ve played it fairly regularly all year. I know a lot of people call out Blake’s voice as a highlight of his work; I find it very effective (particularly in its higher register), but I would also take an album full of his giddy, kaleidoscopic sonic compositions without the vocals. In fact, the better vocal performances on this record belong to Travis Scott on album highlight ‘Mile High’, and ROSALÍA on the haunting, off-kilter ‘Barefoot in the Park’.\n\nThe tempo remains staid throughout, but there’s a range of modes here, between which Blake switches without missing a beat. I find him to be an intriguing musician, and one I can’t quite place comfortably. Somewhere on an archipelago off the coast of electronica, he’s just doing his own thing.\n\n###  13. Foals — *Part 1 Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost*\n\nI had Foals’ debut, *Antidotes*, on release in 2008 and I was ready to file them away with other art-math-rock bands like Klaxons, whose debut (*Myths of the Near Future*) I had admired but not loved the year before. It’s been a welcome surprise to watch Foals grow, and their sonic palate complicate and evolve to something that I can only describe as Biffy Clyro covering The Mars Volta. *What Went Down* (2015) very nearly made my top 20 of that year, largely on the strength of its unassailably huge title track, and now we’re here.\n\nDouble albums are always enormously ambitious projects, and by virtue of the two halves having been released separately I have to consider them individually. You won’t find Part 2 of *ENSWBL* on this list: its late-October release date hasn’t allowed me time to digest it enough. Part 1 has remained on heavy rotation since March, however, and despite that I feel like there’s still plenty more in there for me to discover.\n\n###  12. Tyler, The Creator — *IGOR*\n\nI’m not sure where to start with this record. The palate is hip-hop infused with jazz touches, soul, gospel, and funk. The record opens with an extended synth tone that keys you to the texture of what follows, but what follows is a shifting thing.

My first impression upon hearing *Laughing Matter* was that Wand are also at least at the same dance, even if they’re moving a bit differently to the Oxford quintet.\n\nCory Hanson’s soft, tuneful vocals; Lee Landey’s inquisitive bass lines; Evan Burrows’s restless, inventive percussion… it all adds up to something very impressive. Add in Robert Cody’s brilliantly judged guitar - always happy to play a supporting role that makes each track better - and Sofie Arreguin’s synths adding colour and sonic texture, and you have an album that blooms into something genuinely special.\n\nAside from the, admittedly terrible, none-more-psych-rock album cover, the only disappointment is that the track ‘High Planes Drifter’ isn’t a cover of the 1989 Beastie Boys cut.\n\n###  10. The Regrettes — *How Do You Love?*\n\nI just looked back at my list from 2017 and apparently The Regrettes’ debut (*Feel Your Feelings Fool*) didn’t make the final cut. That surprised me, because in retrospect it’s one of the albums from that year that has had the most staying power for me. And now I have this excellent follow-up to file right alongside it.\n\nAt heart the record is nothing more complicated than a set of relationship songs (from love songs, to break up songs and everything in between), all laid out in frontwoman Lydia Night’s smoky, bluesy vocal, underpinned by soulful bass lines and bright percussion. With the sound having evolved a hair away from the debut’s punk notes the guitar is a little bit pop and a little bit classic 50s rock n’ roll. I fully expect to be playing album highlights ‘California Friends’, ‘ I Dare You’ and ‘Pumpkin’ for years to come.\n\n### 9. Floating Points — *Crush*\n\nMy only other touchstone for the term ‘floating points’ is a measurement of computing power: FLOPS, or floating point operations per second. And to me it feels as though there’s something apt about the name chosen by neuroscientist & epigeneticist Sam Shepherd for his musical project. Intricate, busy beats vie with dense, shifting loops for the listener’s attention; the listening experience is akin to visiting a gallery of impressionist visual art - sometimes bewildering, at points confrontational, but constantly intriguing and compelling.\n\nThere are more easygoing moments, such as ‘Anasickmodular’ with its house beat buried deep in the mix under layers of shifting sonic sands. And there are danceable moments like ‘LesAlpx’ with its room-sized bass. It’s a record that ends up feeling far more than the sum of its parts, and one I’ll likely sit down with again and again when I have a good pair of headphones to hand.\n\n###  8. Fennesz — *Agora*\n\nIt was an odd year for me and electronic / ambient music. I heard a lot of stuff I liked, but nothing quite hit me in the way LPs by Nicolas Jaar, Takeleave, Shigeto, Loscil, and Submerse etc. have in years past. Agora is the highest placing such album on this year’s list, and the closest thing I encountered to an experience like some of those listed above.\n\nAgora is actually more toward the ambient end of the spectrum.

When that record placed seventh on my 2010 list I noted how pleasant a surprise it was that the band had managed to recapture the magic of their debut and replicate its infectious energy.\n\nAnd then *Modern Vampires of the City* (2013) threw me for a loop. A little darker, quite a bit stranger, more… mature, if that’s the right word. Vampire Weekend had shifted gears on me, and despite the fact that the album still features perhaps my favourite of the band’s songs (‘Diane Young’), I wasn’t sure how to make the transition. In a weird way, *Father of the Bride* has returned me to its precursor with new admiration. What the band began six years ago they deliver in spades on this year’s record.\n\nLead single ‘This Life’ is the sort of song that sounds like it always existed, just waiting for someone to intone the magic words to bring it into being. Ezra Koenig’s always smart lyricism does the trick, and we receive another gem of a pop song as a result.\n\nBut Vampire Weekend are reaching for more here. It’s a smart decision to pair Koenig’s (still immediately recognisable) voice with a female guest, and Danielle Haim proves a perfect partner. It’s just one of several signs that the band feel assured enough at this stage to relax away from 3-minute pop-rock jewels, and explore other avenues. At 18 tracks and an hour of running time, *Father of the Bride* gives them plenty of room to do so, and they don’t waste a moment of it.\n\n###  6. Toro y Moi — *Outer Peace*\n\nThird time on the list in a row for Chaz Bear’s one man hazy vibe machine. In 2015 *What For?* made 4th, and two years later / ago *Boo Boo* sat at 13th. In all honesty, there’s not too much to tell the albums apart; if there are musical evolutions here they’re minimal. I for one am quite happy, however, to have one of these records every couple of years – laid back beats, warm, fuzzy production, and Bear’s easygoing vocal delivery remain a tonic.\n\n‘Ordinary Pleasure’ is an effortlessly catchy celebration of art and life in general (and the video’s fun); ‘Who I Am’ is a danceable minimal gem; and ‘Miss Me’ is all space and mood. But the album’s high point for me remains ‘Freelance’, with it’s weird Animal Collective-inspired vocal tic, and typical TyM lyrics mixing the prosaic & profound:\n\n> No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals  \n> I can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old  \n> I can’t hear you, maybe you could change your tone  \n> People tend to listen when they see your soul  \n\n###  5. Jimmy Eat World — *Surviving*\n\nOK, here’s the formula: first you make sure you have one of the year’s best album covers, then you sequence the album so that you start with a statement-of-intent title track, then you start that track with one of the most Jimmy Eat World guitar riffs imaginable. That’s how you kick off a rock record that will get my attention in 2019, and it’s also how you make your return to this list after more than a decade. Don’t get me wrong, 2016’s *Integrity Blues* wasn’t a bad record, and there were things to like on *Invented* (2010) (I barely remember *Damage* (2013) however; I’m not 100% sure that album exists). But it’s been a long time since Jimmy Eat World made a record that felt genuinely great, and the excellent news is that *Surviving* is as good an album as they’ve ever made. I still play *Clarity* (1999) & *Bleed American* (2001) a fair bit, and I can see myself adding this LP to that rotation.\n\nTake, as just one example, ‘All the Way (Stay)’ - the kind of heartfelt, keenly urgent rock song this band are uniquely capable of writing on their best days. This is a record that suggests those are not all behind them.\n\n###  4. Sigrid — *Sucker Punch*\n\nLast year Robyn dropped an album called *Honey* that didn’t make my list, but has grown on me quite a bit since. I mention that here because on *Sucker Punch* Sigrid is working side by side with her Scandinavian sister in the dance-infused electro-pop mines, and boy is she digging out some jewels.\n\nThe album’s title track is a crystal clear, simple slice of joy. ‘Mine Right Now’ feigns innocence for its first 30 seconds and then hits you right in whatever part of your brain responds to synth-driven anthems. And those are just the first two of a dozen near-flawless, glittering pop gems. There are tracks like ‘Don’t Kill My Vibe’ and ‘Level Up’ that are unafraid to dive into more personal, emotional lyricism, but I dare you not to sing along after you’ve heard them a couple of times.\n\nThere are no tricks here, just an assured, lilting vocal style and a cache of catchy tunes produced as simply as you like. That will get you in the top five only if you bring the songwriting goods, and Sigrid’s basket is full. More please.\n\n###  3. Madison Cunningham — *Who Are You Now*\n\nThis was an album that captured me right from the first listen: simple arrangements — rooted in country / folk / bluegrass — and a voice that sounds like clear running water. I was reminded of the stark beauty of Laura Marling’s debut, with a shade of something sharper, à la Jenny Lewis (see eg. the development of ‘Song in My Head’ for a good example of the mix). \n\nThere’s a lightness and a freshness to the album that belies some of its lyrical weight, with Cunningham’s voice effortlessly somersaulting over (deceptively complex) acoustic guitar. ‘Something To Believe In’ features an expressive piano arrangement as an exception to prove the rule. This lightness of touch mixed with often stark emotion has secured the record a Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Americana Album’, which feels richly deserved even if I’m not sure of the category definition. \n\nReleased in summer, this has really come into its own for me as the days got colder and the evenings longer.\n\n###  2. Jade Bird — *Jade Bird*\n\nFirst you have to get over the voice: it sounds like it’s that of a seasoned folk-rock trooper who has been on the road since the 70s with a pack of Marlboros tucked in her sleeve, but it actually belongs to a 22 year old from Northumberland.\n\nOnce you’re past that you can enjoy some of the most enjoyable, well crafted voice-and-a-guitar songs I’ve heard in quite some time. Like a louder, brasher Laura Marling who sounds like she might have a knife in her boot, Bird lays out beautiful, impassioned stories of love and loss one after another as though it’s easy to do. The voice *or* the songwriting would likely place this record on this List, but the combination has it at number two because it’s nothing short of magical.\n\nSliding up four notes in the final moments of ‘Side Effects’, shifting from fragile to indomitable on ‘My Motto’, or somehow conveying both regret and strength in the same line: “Are you sure you wanna do this now?” (‘Ruins’). There’s also a key change on that last song (in fact the album’s opener) which just about kills me every time. And those are just the first examples that come to mind.\n\n‘Uh Huh’ & ‘Good at It’ are a kind of one-two punch of an update to Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, and in fact the comparison feels apt. This is top tier songwriting and one of the most compelling deliveries I’ve heard in some time.\n\n###  1. Taylor Swift — *Lover*\n\nIt seems to me that each of the past few years when putting together this list I’ve mounted a case for one straight-ahead pop record or another. (Tove Styrke’s *Sway* (#13 last year) being the most recent example.) It felt inevitable that at some point one of those records was going to plant its flag this deep in my heart. Top spot this year goes to the record I played more than any other, by the artist I played more than any other.\nAccording to Music I’ve listened to 1,155 hours’ of music this year. That’s 143 different artists, and 186 different releases. And yet seven out of my top ten most listened-to tracks, including the entire top five, come from one record. And I’m not nearly done playing any of them. In reverse order then:\n\n• ‘I Forgot that You Existed’: the album opener is the sound of someone reclaiming their power with as assured a light touch as you can imagine. A sparse musical bed over which Swift’s voice floats, saying goodbye to something she doesn’t need anymore.\n\n• ‘The Man’: an upbeat synth-pop masterpiece by way of feminist anthem, and like every song here entirely impossible not to sing along to every time you hear it.\n\n• ‘The Archer’: a downbeat synth-pop masterpiece showcasing Swift at her most emotionally vulnerable as it builds to something more powerful. \n\n• ‘You Need to Calm Down’: instantly ranks alongside my favourite pop tracks of all time. The five layered “uh ohs” of the bridge have pretty much been stuck in my head all year. A beautiful, righteous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community. \n\n• ‘Lover’: my most-listened to song of 2019 is an exquisite, tender ballad about holding close that which you love. \n\nAnd then there’s ‘Paper Rings’, ‘ME!’, ‘I Think He Knows’….\n\nIt’s kind of fitting that it’s Swift who takes this giant leap for pop music kind and claims top spot on my List. I’ve been increasingly impressed with her as a cultural figure since she handled the whole Kanye West / VMAs debacle with such grace. It was Swift’s protest that single-handedly got Apple to agree to pay artists when their music was listened to during the free trial period of the Music streaming service. And most recently she has been both an increasingly vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and an increasingly visible opponent of industry practices that place record companies entirely in control of artists’ work. \n\nSo, alongside becoming the most decorated performer in the history of the American Music Awards, and being heralded their ‘Artist of the Decade’, here’s another trophy for Taylor’s shelf: she made my favourite album of 2019.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"title": "The List 2018",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-jaguwar--ringthing\">20. JAGUWAR — <em>Ringthing</em></h3>\n<p>Sometimes you need some shoegaze. Or, rather, sometimes I just need a sound I can hide my head inside like a great cloud of candyfloss. The peddles are less aggressively tuned, and the layering of tracks frequently too sparse for this to be considered <em>true</em> shoegaze, but JAGUWAR have put my bloody valentine and Battles in a blender, with a dash of The Cure, and poured something out. Sometimes it sounds amiably mournful (‘Crystal’), sometimes it’s mournfully amiable (‘Away’). In either case, I’ve been happy to spend quite a bit of time with headphones on letting this rain down on me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-john-tejada--dead-start-program\">19. John Tejada — <em>Dead Start Program</em></h3>\n<p>Headphone electronica from a journeyman of the genre. This is a record that is uneven in terms of its moods, but unflagging in terms of quality. Tempos and timbres alter from track to track – frenetic and impatient on ‘All at Sea’, upbeat and celebratory on ‘Heal’ – but throughout there’s an attention to detail, and a well-honed sense of experimentation that keeps the listener guessing and the rhythms interesting. Album highlight for me since first listen has been the joyously off-kilter ‘Detector’, which seems to dare you to connect either with its cheeky melody or its grimy bass, and then try to marry the two in your mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-snail-mail--lush\">18. Snail Mail — <em>Lush</em></h3>\n<p>I closed last year’s list with a note on my amazement that Jay Som’s <em>Everybody Works</em> had emerged from one woman’s bedroom a finished and singular project. I’d like to reiterate those sentiments here with respect to <em>Lush</em> – I don’t understand how a 19 year old can listen (in all likelihood) to a whole bunch of Sonic Youth and Elliot Smith records, and then produce something this heartfelt and eloquent. Even though, in this instance, she’s playing with a band rather than multi-instrumenting it, the question remains: how does one find one’s artistic voice with such clarity? In particular there are some really nice lyrical moments here that elevate simple but effective song structures to something very memorable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-this-will-destroy-you--new-others-part-one--two\">17. This Will Destroy You — <em>New Others Part One / Two</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve been awaiting a new TWDY release since I discovered their self-titled album a few years ago in a lull between Explosions in the Sky LPs. And that’s what’s on offer here. Given to slightly less bombast than their fellow Texans, but painting with similar colours in a similar style, this is wide open music with a big heart and dreams as big as its regrets.</p>\n<p>Two albums by the same band, which share a title, but were released weeks apart. So… you’re not going to let me have both, are you? In which case I choose the slightly more familiar, warm embrace of <em>New Others Part One</em> over the marginally more experimental, slightly rougher-around-the-edges, <em>…Part Two</em>. If only they’d released this as a double album though!</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-black-belt-eagle-scout--mother-of-my-children\">16. Black Belt Eagle Scout — <em>Mother of My Children</em></h3>\n<p>The DNA of this record sounds more complicated to me with each passing listen. What I thought, at first, was a relatively straightforward collection of heartfelt, understated indie-folk started to express different parts of itself the more I replayed the album. There’s some Hole in there somewhere, and some influences or at least similarities with other acts on Saddle Creek. The guitars are by turns strummed or else distorted and contorted. The drums sometimes think they’d like to be on a different album. The vocals are perhaps the most consistent element of the record’s shifting composition, but they’re used to convey lyrics that first burn then soothe; that are twisted with grief, and then adamant with resilience.</p>\n<p>All of this starts to make more sense when you learn that the woman behind the record – it’s a solo project by Katherine Paul – identifies as a radical indigenous queer feminist. This is an album that is grown from the soil of both personal losses, and the protests at Standing Rock. It strives to capture something both intimate and universal about loss and change. And from the fuzzed up opener ‘Soft Stud’ to the sad, slight closer ‘Sam, A Dream’, it succeeds again and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-oh-pep--i-wasnt-only-thinking-about-you\">15. Oh Pep! — <em>I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You…</em></h3>\n<p>Listening to this record calls up for me a history of enjoying the output of Laura Veirs, Azure Ray, Jenny Lewis et al. It’s a lightly whipped mix of indie guitar and personal vocals with the kind of modest scale that means I would rather see them perform at Camden Lock than Brixton Academy. There’s a cute PR backstory about how the two members met by accident and formed a band out of necessity, but the important part is that their twin vocals work superbly well together. The instrumentation is relatively slight, and everything is handled with a deft lightness of touch, counterpointing the sometimes downbeat lyrics. This isn’t a record that demands much of the listener, but provides excellent company whether used as walking-around music, or bright afternoon stereo listening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-screaming-females--all-at-once\">14. Screaming Females — <em>All At Once</em></h3>\n<p>The bedrock of Screaming Females’ sound is a combination of moderately treated guitar, fuzzed-up bass, and largely simple-but-effective drums. Theirs is a sound that, if encountered on the radio, would these days leave you guessing which of the last three decades it had come from. The key is doing it well, and this record is proof enough that the formula still works. The band’s marquee attraction comes in the form of Marissa Paternoster’s vocals. There’s a little Kim Deal here, and a dash of Laura Jane Grace: as driving as the guitars, as rough edged as the bass, and as straight-to-business as the drums. The record’s signature attraction for me is her ability to wind the vocal melodies around her own impressive guitar lines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-tove-styrke--sway\">13. Tove Styrke — <em>Sway</em></h3>\n<p>Pop music! Who doesn’t love (some of) it? Over the years I’ve learned to accept that when a song or album or artist just <em>works</em> for me, I shouldn’t question it, just enjoy it. So, here’s the third album by a Swedish electropop artist I’ve never heard of before.</p>\n<p>‘Mistakes’ is a brain limpet of a potency only equalled by a few songs this year; one of them is titled ‘Sway’ and it opens this album with an impossible-to-follow dopamine pop of pure, fleeting pleasure.</p>\n<p>Will I still be listening to this album in a couple of years? Unlikely. Did it offer me a lot of unfiltered joy this year? Yes, yes it did.</p>\n<p>(For the record, my favourite pop song of the year was probably Ariana Grande’s ‘the light is coming’.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-young-fathers--cocoa-sugar\">12. Young Fathers — <em>Cocoa Sugar</em></h3>\n<p>Like most, I first encountered Young Fathers when they won the Mercury in 2014. I’m remiss in not doing my due diligence in the years since, only catching up with their second LP (<em>White Men are Black Men Too</em> (2015)) late. But I was there for the release of <em>Cocoa Sugar</em>, which immediately won a place on this list with its mercurial strangeness. Like a more introverted TV On The Radio, this is a group that seems to make its music by taking a melody or a bass line or a lyric, and twisting it until it deforms into something else.</p>\n<p>‘In My View’ is the album highlight, doing something with syncopation and muted vocals that I haven’t heard used as effectively since Woodkid’s ‘Iron’ (2011). But there’s plenty to love and explore here, whether it’s the dark thicket of ‘Wow’ or the upside-down anthem ‘Picking You’ that closes the record. Come for the eye-catching album cover, stay for… whatever is happening sonically here. You’ll get something from it, even if it’s difficult to predict what, exactly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-say-sue-me--where-we-were-together\">11. Say Sue Me — <em>Where We Were Together</em></h3>\n<p>If a Korean band release a pop record, is it K-pop? Actually, this couldn’t be further from the hyper-stylised output that’s increasingly making its presence felt in western charts. This is as good a collection of understated pop-verging-into-rock songs as any I heard this year. It’s warm and enthusiastic, and cribs from a whole range of western pop influences going back as far as maybe the Beach Boys. The production also has a glow to it that I really like, making it sound at times like elements were recorded in a large room, whilst the vocals remain up close and personal - sometimes barely above a whisper. The effortless, propulsive ’Old Town’ and ‘I Just Wanna Dance’ are where the record really shines, but epic closer ‘Coming to the End’ also deserves a shout out for hinting at ambition the rest of the album hadn’t showcased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-gogo-penguin--a-humdrum-star\">10. GoGo Penguin — <em>A Humdrum Star</em></h3>\n<p>I cheated a bit when searching for a way to describe GoGo Penguin (who are new to me this year despite several records and a Mercury nomination in their past). Here’s a quote pulled from their official site:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their music has been described as acoustic-electronica but they draw equally on rock, jazz and minimalism, game soundtracks and glitchy-electronica…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure that enables you to guess precisely what this record sounds like (if you haven’t heard it). For me the closest touchstone is perhaps Portico Quartet in their original incarnation, before they discovered synths. ‘Transient State’ almost runs away with itself, but deceptively complex jazz drumming keeps the piano just about in check. ‘Reactor’ rides its funky bass line down a series of tilting corridors, and ends up somewhere interesting. Sub 3-minute tracks sit alongside 8-minute plus odysseys, as this group of fine musicians seem to just enjoy exploring where they can take their sound.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-dott--heart-swell\">9. DOTT — <em>Heart Swell</em></h3>\n<p>There’s nothing new or particularly inventive about this record. I haven’t gone back through the band’s catalogue, but I’m guessing they have been doing more or less exactly this for a while. Power-chord pop, lightly treated vocals, bouncy bass lines, sometimes over-enthusiastic drum fills. They’re simple proof that these particular mines still have some gems left in them to find.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Bleached Blonde’ is a clarion call for enthusiasm, requesting that the listener throw caution to the wind and their arms to the sky. ’Like A Girl’ is a feminist anthem in the making (with a fun video to match). The stand out, for me, is the almost-too-simple ‘How Do I Feel?’: under 2 minutes of pop perfection that could have been released any year since the mid 50s, but still fresh sounding after it has been playing in my head all day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-middle-kids--lost-friends\">8. Middle Kids — <em>Lost Friends</em></h3>\n<p>Every year I have at least one record full of three minute pop songs. This year it comes from an Australian trio, and it’s a little more emotionally diverse than perhaps is usual. ‘On My Knees’ is raucous and built for festival crowds, ‘Hole’ is plaintive, ‘Please’ is anthemic and optimistic, and ‘Mistake’ just might be my favourite song of the whole year (it’s certainly among the most infectious).</p>\n<p>Hannah Joy’s vocals are characterised by a strength shot through with wavering vulnerability, and it feels as though the rest of the band’s sound has been modelled around it. This is a sweet record, but one with bruises. Its heart is on its sleeve, and it wants to link arms with you and sing together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-shinya-fukumori-trio--for-2-akis\">7. Shinya Fukumori Trio — <em>For 2 Akis</em></h3>\n<p>You might be expecting by now that each of my lists comes with a token jazz record. I listened to less of the genre than I would have liked this year, with only a handful of releases really breaking through. The most notable amongst them, and the one I played more than any other by some margin, was this debut offering by the Japanese drummer’s newly-formed ensemble. Subtle, creative percussion; sweet, explorative tenor saxophone; contemplative piano. I could listen to this sound all day, preferably on headphones so as to get the most out of the record’s production, which allows each instrument a lot of space and the listener room enough to wander between them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-low--double-negative\">6. Low — <em>Double Negative</em></h3>\n<p>Low are a band that sit squarely within my pile of shame. Formed in 1993, and with no fewer than eleven albums preceding this one, I’ve paid criminally little attention to them if this record is anything to judge by. My guess however (and it is just a guess, since I haven’t done the legwork), is that they weren’t making music that sounded like this in the mid-90s. I could be wrong, but in particular the use of decayed samples here seems very much of the moment.</p>\n<p>I love everything about this record, starting with the art direction, and on through its warm production, its subtle instrumentation, and the dreamy texture of the vocals. (This is also my headphone album of the year!) I feel like there’s at least one record every year that I say this about, but every moment of <em>Double Negative</em> speaks to a band at full command of their powers, masterfully employing every tool at their disposal to get the sound in their heads onto tape. On every listen through, 49 minutes flies by and I’m left wanting to re-experience the whole thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-beacon--gravity-pairs\">5. Beacon — <em>Gravity Pairs</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s a case of first-listen certainty. In fact, arguably, this was a near lock for the list after I had heard only the leading single ‘Be My Organ’, which remains among my favourite tracks of the year.</p>\n<p>This is an electronica of smooth, reflective surfaces, that also makes use of acoustic instrumentation (notably piano) to augment it. Layered on top are subtle vocals that are almost played like an additional instrument rather than being the focal point of any of the tracks. It’s melancholy stuff in places (eg. ‘Bending Light’), but many of the melodies are quite beautiful. The group’s most valuable talent seems to be a sense of exactly when to modulate emotions either within individual tracks, or over the album as a whole. As a result <em>Gravity Pairs</em> fits together like a polished crystal - smooth to the touch, but full of fragments and distortions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-elohim--elohim\">4. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s a slightly confusing situation. You may recall that the number 3 spot on 2016’s list was held by Elohim’s self-titled debut album. At the time she was very much talking about it as her first album, but at some point since has decided it was a 10-track EP. To make matters worse, this year she released what she now considers her debut LP… and gave it the same title.</p>\n<p>Forget all of that. It makes no difference to the fact that ‘I Want You’ is light and breezy electronic pop of the highest order, ‘F**k Your Money’ is understated and darkly sly, and ‘Panic Attacks’ is an exquisite club anthem with the volume turned waaaaay down.</p>\n<p>As far as I’m concerned, Elohim can make whatever she wants and title it whatever she likes. After these two releases, I’ll be there to find out how it gets weirder.</p>\n<p>(PS. I <em>really</em> wanted to put this at number 3, just for the symmetry, but…)</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-takeleave--inner-sea\">3. Takeleave — <em>Inner Sea</em></h3>\n<p>In a year without an album release from my soul’s resident musician Submerse, to whom am I to turn for premium grade liminal electronica™? This is literally the thought process that found me listening to everything Berlin label Project Mooncircle put out this year. And among a veritable bevy of delights I was relieved and overjoyed to find this from Takeleave. It shifts, it glows, it washes over you in waves timed to your slowing heartbeat. Call it downtempo house, or ambient techno, or broken beats… I don’t mind. This is the sound I need to frequently bathe my brain in, and it was so nice to find someone else making it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-anna-burch--quit-the-curse\">2. Anna Burch — <em>Quit the Curse</em></h3>\n<p>On her debut record, Anna Burch sounds like the finished article. And she’s bringing along a complex melding of folk, art-rock, indie, and old-fashioned pop hooks. I don’t know how she got surf-adjacent guitar to sit alongside Pavement vocal stylings. Maybe if Ben Kweller and Lana Del Ray covered Surfer Blood, and you played it back at 2/3 speed it would sound like this?</p>\n<p>However she’s managing to do it, and make it sound effortless, <em>Quit The Curse</em> is a very pretty record with its makeup smudged, wearing the same clothes it wore yesterday. I could listen to it all day. Try ‘2 Cool 2 Care’ and ‘In Your Dreams’ and you’ll either fall head over heels for it, or discover your heart has been hardened against all the world’s beauty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-aal-against-all-logic--2012-2017\">1. AAL (Against All Logic) — <em>2012-2017</em></h3>\n<p>OK, this is where the fun begins. First of all, don’t be fooled by the artist’s name: this is a new record by Nicolas Jaar, working under one of his many monikers – presumably to avoid being pigeonholed. His previous release, <em>Sirens</em> (2016), was one I struggled with leaving off my list for that year. I had no such internal conflict with this one; right from the first time I heard it (in February), I knew that <em>2012-2017</em> would make the final cut.</p>\n<p>Where I do need to make special pleading, arguably, is the fact that some of the work here has appeared within continuous mixes that Jaar has done for various outlets over the last couple of years. Many tracks are entirely new, but portions of a few have cropped up before. Nevertheless, this is the first time any of the work has been released in record format, so I’m claiming it.</p>\n<p>This is precisely at the epicentre of one of my favourite electronica subgenres: endlessly exploratory, and happy to bring in influences from all over the musical spectrum to colour its own sound. Opener ‘This Old House Is All I Have’ twists blues into the mix, album highlight ’Know You’ hijacks soul and funk… and so on. But the record’s sound is also miraculously cohesive and quite singular, providing consistent thrills throughout. Some of music’s most thrilling moments of 2018 are contained herein for me, and they’re couched in a shifting bed of melody that I was absolutely entranced by.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"notable-mentions-aka-the-next-30-in-alphabetical-order\">Notable Mentions (aka the next 30, in alphabetical order)</h3>\n<p>• The Beths – Future Me Hates Me<br>\n• The Breeders – All Nerve<br>\n• Cat Power – Wanderer<br>\n• Chastity – Death Lust<br>\n• Cosmic Thoughts – Work Night Out<br>\n• CUTS – A Gradual Decline<br>\n• Lucy Dacus – Historian<br>\n• Djrum – Portrait With Firewood<br>\n• Father John Misty – God’s Favorite Customer<br>\n• Forth Wanderers – Forth Wanderers<br>\n• GoGo Penguin – A Humdrum Star<br>\n• Mass Gothic – I’ve Tortured You Long Enough<br>\n• Holly Miranda – Mutual Horse<br>\n• Nas – NASIR<br>\n• Prefuse 73 – Sacrifices<br>\n• Profligate – Somewhere Else<br>\n• Proud Parents – Proud Parents<br>\n• Rejoicer – Energy Dreams<br>\n• Rival Consoles – Persona<br>\n• Robyn – Honey<br>\n• Caroline Rose – Loner<br>\n• Jeff Rosenstock – POST–<br>\n• Ross From Friends – Family Portrait<br>\n• Superchunk – What A Time To Be Alive<br>\n• TSVI – Inner Worlds<br>\n• Tangents – New Bodies<br>\n• Tanukichan – Sundays<br>\n• Throwing Snow – Loma<br>\n• Tirzah – Devotion<br>\n• ZHU – RINGOS BEACH</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. JAGUWAR — *Ringthing*\n\nSometimes you need some shoegaze. Or, rather, sometimes I just need a sound I can hide my head inside like a great cloud of candyfloss. The peddles are less aggressively tuned, and the layering of tracks frequently too sparse for this to be considered *true* shoegaze, but JAGUWAR have put my bloody valentine and Battles in a blender, with a dash of The Cure, and poured something out. Sometimes it sounds amiably mournful (‘Crystal’), sometimes it’s mournfully amiable (‘Away’). In either case, I’ve been happy to spend quite a bit of time with headphones on letting this rain down on me. \n\n###  19. John Tejada — *Dead Start Program*\n\nHeadphone electronica from a journeyman of the genre. This is a record that is uneven in terms of its moods, but unflagging in terms of quality. Tempos and timbres alter from track to track – frenetic and impatient on ‘All at Sea’, upbeat and celebratory on ‘Heal’ – but throughout there’s an attention to detail, and a well-honed sense of experimentation that keeps the listener guessing and the rhythms interesting. Album highlight for me since first listen has been the joyously off-kilter ‘Detector’, which seems to dare you to connect either with its cheeky melody or its grimy bass, and then try to marry the two in your mind.\n\n###  18. Snail Mail — *Lush*\n\nI closed last year’s list with a note on my amazement that Jay Som’s *Everybody Works* had emerged from one woman’s bedroom a finished and singular project. I’d like to reiterate those sentiments here with respect to *Lush* – I don’t understand how a 19 year old can listen (in all likelihood) to a whole bunch of Sonic Youth and Elliot Smith records, and then produce something this heartfelt and eloquent. Even though, in this instance, she’s playing with a band rather than multi-instrumenting it, the question remains: how does one find one’s artistic voice with such clarity? In particular there are some really nice lyrical moments here that elevate simple but effective song structures to something very memorable. \n\n###  17. This Will Destroy You — *New Others Part One / Two*\n\nI’ve been awaiting a new TWDY release since I discovered their self-titled album a few years ago in a lull between Explosions in the Sky LPs. And that’s what’s on offer here. Given to slightly less bombast than their fellow Texans, but painting with similar colours in a similar style, this is wide open music with a big heart and dreams as big as its regrets. \n\nTwo albums by the same band, which share a title, but were released weeks apart. So… you’re not going to let me have both, are you? In which case I choose the slightly more familiar, warm embrace of *New Others Part One* over the marginally more experimental, slightly rougher-around-the-edges, *…Part Two*. If only they’d released this as a double album though!\n\n###  16. Black Belt Eagle Scout — *Mother of My Children*\n\nThe DNA of this record sounds more complicated to me with each passing listen. What I thought, at first, was a relatively straightforward collection of heartfelt, understated indie-folk started to express different parts of itself the more I replayed the album. There’s some Hole in there somewhere, and some influences or at least similarities with other acts on Saddle Creek. The guitars are by turns strummed or else distorted and contorted. The drums sometimes think they’d like to be on a different album. The vocals are perhaps the most consistent element of the record’s shifting composition, but they’re used to convey lyrics that first burn then soothe; that are twisted with grief, and then adamant with resilience. \n\nAll of this starts to make more sense when you learn that the woman behind the record – it’s a solo project by Katherine Paul – identifies as a radical indigenous queer feminist. This is an album that is grown from the soil of both personal losses, and the protests at Standing Rock. It strives to capture something both intimate and universal about loss and change. And from the fuzzed up opener ‘Soft Stud’ to the sad, slight closer ‘Sam, A Dream’, it succeeds again and again. \n\n###  15. Oh Pep! — *I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You…*\n\nListening to this record calls up for me a history of enjoying the output of Laura Veirs, Azure Ray, Jenny Lewis et al. It’s a lightly whipped mix of indie guitar and personal vocals with the kind of modest scale that means I would rather see them perform at Camden Lock than Brixton Academy. There’s a cute PR backstory about how the two members met by accident and formed a band out of necessity, but the important part is that their twin vocals work superbly well together. The instrumentation is relatively slight, and everything is handled with a deft lightness of touch, counterpointing the sometimes downbeat lyrics. This isn’t a record that demands much of the listener, but provides excellent company whether used as walking-around music, or bright afternoon stereo listening.\n\n###  14. Screaming Females — *All At Once*\n\nThe bedrock of Screaming Females’ sound is a combination of moderately treated guitar, fuzzed-up bass, and largely simple-but-effective drums. Theirs is a sound that, if encountered on the radio, would these days leave you guessing which of the last three decades it had come from. The key is doing it well, and this record is proof enough that the formula still works. The band’s marquee attraction comes in the form of Marissa Paternoster’s vocals. There’s a little Kim Deal here, and a dash of Laura Jane Grace: as driving as the guitars, as rough edged as the bass, and as straight-to-business as the drums. The record’s signature attraction for me is her ability to wind the vocal melodies around her own impressive guitar lines. \n\n### 13. Tove Styrke — *Sway*\n\nPop music! Who doesn’t love (some of) it? Over the years I’ve learned to accept that when a song or album or artist just *works* for me, I shouldn’t question it, just enjoy it. So, here’s the third album by a Swedish electropop artist I’ve never heard of before. \n\n‘Mistakes’ is a brain limpet of a potency only equalled by a few songs this year; one of them is titled ‘Sway’ and it opens this album with an impossible-to-follow dopamine pop of pure, fleeting pleasure. \n\nWill I still be listening to this album in a couple of years? Unlikely. Did it offer me a lot of unfiltered joy this year? Yes, yes it did. \n\n(For the record, my favourite pop song of the year was probably Ariana Grande’s ‘the light is coming’.)\n\n###  12. Young Fathers — *Cocoa Sugar*\n\nLike most, I first encountered Young Fathers when they won the Mercury in 2014. I’m remiss in not doing my due diligence in the years since, only catching up with their second LP (*White Men are Black Men Too* (2015)) late. But I was there for the release of *Cocoa Sugar*, which immediately won a place on this list with its mercurial strangeness. Like a more introverted TV On The Radio, this is a group that seems to make its music by taking a melody or a bass line or a lyric, and twisting it until it deforms into something else. \n\n‘In My View’ is the album highlight, doing something with syncopation and muted vocals that I haven’t heard used as effectively since Woodkid’s ‘Iron’ (2011). But there’s plenty to love and explore here, whether it’s the dark thicket of ‘Wow’ or the upside-down anthem ‘Picking You’ that closes the record. Come for the eye-catching album cover, stay for… whatever is happening sonically here. You’ll get something from it, even if it’s difficult to predict what, exactly.\n\n###  11. Say Sue Me — *Where We Were Together*\n\nIf a Korean band release a pop record, is it K-pop? Actually, this couldn’t be further from the hyper-stylised output that’s increasingly making its presence felt in western charts. This is as good a collection of understated pop-verging-into-rock songs as any I heard this year. It’s warm and enthusiastic, and cribs from a whole range of western pop influences going back as far as maybe the Beach Boys. The production also has a glow to it that I really like, making it sound at times like elements were recorded in a large room, whilst the vocals remain up close and personal - sometimes barely above a whisper. The effortless, propulsive ’Old Town’ and ‘I Just Wanna Dance’ are where the record really shines, but epic closer ‘Coming to the End’ also deserves a shout out for hinting at ambition the rest of the album hadn’t showcased.\n\n###  10. GoGo Penguin — *A Humdrum Star*\n\nI cheated a bit when searching for a way to describe GoGo Penguin (who are new to me this year despite several records and a Mercury nomination in their past). Here’s a quote pulled from their official site: \n\n> Their music has been described as acoustic-electronica but they draw equally on rock, jazz and minimalism, game soundtracks and glitchy-electronica…\n\nI’m sure that enables you to guess precisely what this record sounds like (if you haven’t heard it). For me the closest touchstone is perhaps Portico Quartet in their original incarnation, before they discovered synths. ‘Transient State’ almost runs away with itself, but deceptively complex jazz drumming keeps the piano just about in check. ‘Reactor’ rides its funky bass line down a series of tilting corridors, and ends up somewhere interesting. Sub 3-minute tracks sit alongside 8-minute plus odysseys, as this group of fine musicians seem to just enjoy exploring where they can take their sound. \n\n###  9. DOTT — *Heart Swell*\n\nThere’s nothing new or particularly inventive about this record. I haven’t gone back through the band’s catalogue, but I’m guessing they have been doing more or less exactly this for a while. Power-chord pop, lightly treated vocals, bouncy bass lines, sometimes over-enthusiastic drum fills. They’re simple proof that these particular mines still have some gems left in them to find. \n\nOpener ‘Bleached Blonde’ is a clarion call for enthusiasm, requesting that the listener throw caution to the wind and their arms to the sky. ’Like A Girl’ is a feminist anthem in the making (with a fun video to match). The stand out, for me, is the almost-too-simple ‘How Do I Feel?’: under 2 minutes of pop perfection that could have been released any year since the mid 50s, but still fresh sounding after it has been playing in my head all day.\n\n###  8. Middle Kids — *Lost Friends*\n\nEvery year I have at least one record full of three minute pop songs. This year it comes from an Australian trio, and it’s a little more emotionally diverse than perhaps is usual. ‘On My Knees’ is raucous and built for festival crowds, ‘Hole’ is plaintive, ‘Please’ is anthemic and optimistic, and ‘Mistake’ just might be my favourite song of the whole year (it’s certainly among the most infectious). \n\nHannah Joy’s vocals are characterised by a strength shot through with wavering vulnerability, and it feels as though the rest of the band’s sound has been modelled around it. This is a sweet record, but one with bruises. Its heart is on its sleeve, and it wants to link arms with you and sing together.\n\n###  7. Shinya Fukumori Trio — *For 2 Akis*\n\nYou might be expecting by now that each of my lists comes with a token jazz record. I listened to less of the genre than I would have liked this year, with only a handful of releases really breaking through. The most notable amongst them, and the one I played more than any other by some margin, was this debut offering by the Japanese drummer’s newly-formed ensemble. Subtle, creative percussion; sweet, explorative tenor saxophone; contemplative piano. I could listen to this sound all day, preferably on headphones so as to get the most out of the record’s production, which allows each instrument a lot of space and the listener room enough to wander between them. \n\n###  6. Low — *Double Negative*\n\nLow are a band that sit squarely within my pile of shame. Formed in 1993, and with no fewer than eleven albums preceding this one, I’ve paid criminally little attention to them if this record is anything to judge by. My guess however (and it is just a guess, since I haven’t done the legwork), is that they weren’t making music that sounded like this in the mid-90s. I could be wrong, but in particular the use of decayed samples here seems very much of the moment. \n\nI love everything about this record, starting with the art direction, and on through its warm production, its subtle instrumentation, and the dreamy texture of the vocals.

I feel like there’s at least one record every year that I say this about, but every moment of *Double Negative* speaks to a band at full command of their powers, masterfully employing every tool at their disposal to get the sound in their heads onto tape.

In fact, arguably, this was a near lock for the list after I had heard only the leading single ‘Be My Organ’, which remains among my favourite tracks of the year. \n\nThis is an electronica of smooth, reflective surfaces, that also makes use of acoustic instrumentation (notably piano) to augment it.

You may recall that the number 3 spot on 2016’s list was held by Elohim’s self-titled debut album. At the time she was very much talking about it as her first album, but at some point since has decided it was a 10-track EP.

After these two releases, I’ll be there to find out how it gets weirder.\n\n(PS. I *really* wanted to put this at number 3, just for the symmetry, but…)\n\n###  3. Takeleave — *Inner Sea*\n\nIn a year without an album release from my soul’s resident musician Submerse, to whom am I to turn for premium grade liminal electronica™? This is literally the thought process that found me listening to everything Berlin label Project Mooncircle put out this year. And among a veritable bevy of delights I was relieved and overjoyed to find this from Takeleave. It shifts, it glows, it washes over you in waves timed to your slowing heartbeat.

AAL (Against All Logic) — *2012-2017*\n\nOK, this is where the fun begins. First of all, don’t be fooled by the artist’s name: this is a new record by Nicolas Jaar, working under one of his many monikers – presumably to avoid being pigeonholed.

				"title": "Public Metrics on Social Networks",
				"content_html": "<p>I’m convinced that many of the problems with social networks are attributable primarily to the way in which they handle metrics. Data is routinely made public without consideration as to its utility, and as a direct result users are coached to use the services in ways counter to their own interests.</p>\n<p>Taking Twitter as an example, consider the various things for which the user is presented a numerical value on their own profile: Tweets; Tweets &amp; Replies; Followers; Following; Lists; Likes; Moments; Notifications; Direct Messages. For the most part these are purely informational with respect to one’s own account; only Notifications and Direct Messages may include calls to action. Now consider the categories of information available when viewing another user’s public account: Tweets; Following; Followers; Likes; Lists. Do any of these numbers, as they relate to another person’s account, have any value to you? Let’s take each one in turn:</p>\n<p>• <strong>Tweets</strong>: Reading an account’s public posts is obviously central to how Twitter functions, but there is no need to display a count of how many posts they’ve made overall.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Following</strong>: It may be of interest to you to see which accounts a person follows. I would argue that this should be something that each individual user of Twitter should have the ability to share or keep private. In either case, there is no good reason to display the number of accounts they follow.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Followers</strong>: The same is true here. You might be interested to see who follows an account, but this should be something the account holder chooses whether or not to share. Regardless, there is no need to display the number of followers an account has.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Likes</strong>: I can see no reason to display the number of posts an account holder has liked. As above with Following &amp; Followers, this should be something the account holder can choose to reveal or not. I feel Twitter’s <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html\">introduction of Bookmarks</a> in February 2018 — whilst they certainly have valid alternative uses — was partly a tacit admission that Likes being public isn’t ideal.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Lists</strong>: Compared with the others the number next to Lists is of little consequence, but the reasons why are revealing. Firstly, Lists are an aspect of Twitter over which the user <em>does</em> have complete control with respect to their public / private status. Private Lists do not show on a user’s Profile, and are not included in the count of Lists. Secondly, there is no judgment associated with the number of Lists one maintains.</p>\n<p>This last point brings us to the second part of the argument. Not only does the public nature of these numbers have no <em>positive</em> value, it is often detrimental to the functioning of the service. Social networks are a messy hybrid of communication, publication, and advertising.

				"content_text": "I’m convinced that many of the problems with social networks are attributable primarily to the way in which they handle metrics. Data is routinely made public without consideration as to its utility, and as a direct result users are coached to use the services in ways counter to their own interests. \n\nTaking Twitter as an example, consider the various things for which the user is presented a numerical value on their own profile: Tweets; Tweets & Replies; Followers; Following; Lists; Likes; Moments; Notifications; Direct Messages. For the most part these are purely informational with respect to one’s own account; only Notifications and Direct Messages may include calls to action. Now consider the categories of information available when viewing another user’s public account: Tweets; Following; Followers; Likes; Lists. Do any of these numbers, as they relate to another person’s account, have any value to you? Let’s take each one in turn:\n\n• **Tweets**: Reading an account’s public posts is obviously central to how Twitter functions, but there is no need to display a count of how many posts they’ve made overall.   \n\n• **Following**: It may be of interest to you to see which accounts a person follows. I would argue that this should be something that each individual user of Twitter should have the ability to share or keep private. In either case, there is no good reason to display the number of accounts they follow.\n\n• **Followers**: The same is true here. You might be interested to see who follows an account, but this should be something the account holder chooses whether or not to share. Regardless, there is no need to display the number of followers an account has.\n\n• **Likes**: I can see no reason to display the number of posts an account holder has liked. As above with Following & Followers, this should be something the account holder can choose to reveal or not. I feel Twitter’s [introduction of Bookmarks](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html) in February 2018 — whilst they certainly have valid alternative uses — was partly a tacit admission that Likes being public isn’t ideal.\n\n• **Lists**: Compared with the others the number next to Lists is of little consequence, but the reasons why are revealing. Firstly, Lists are an aspect of Twitter over which the user *does* have complete control with respect to their public / private status. Private Lists do not show on a user’s Profile, and are not included in the count of Lists. Secondly, there is no judgment associated with the number of Lists one maintains. \n\nThis last point brings us to the second part of the argument. Not only does the public nature of these numbers have no *positive* value, it is often detrimental to the functioning of the service. Social networks are a messy hybrid of communication, publication, and advertising. Nothing good comes of the lines between these functions being blurred or erased, and nothing contributes more to this problem than public metrics. When the count of one’s Tweets, Followers, and Likes is unalterably public, one feels some pressure to keep an eye on the numbers, and quite possibly alter one’s behaviour on the platform (to one degree or another) to change them in the manner one desires to see them change. There is an important distinction here: for example between ‘wanting more followers’ and ‘wanting to *be seen* to have more followers’. The former may be rooted in a number of motivations, some of them beneficent. The latter is only really attributable to anxiety over reputation, and does no one any good. \n\nThe effect of this is even more detrimental in the case of individual posts.

I don’t remember where I first learned about the idea, but since I became aware of it I’ve seen it pitched as the centre of a Venn diagram between spa treatment and mindfulness experience. The core principle is simply to remove as much external stimulus as possible. That means absolute darkness, near silence, and weightless suspension in water heated to your body temperature, such that gravity and touch are counterbalanced.</p>\n<p>In a private room, the first step is to take a quick shower whilst the pod finishes its cleaning cycle. Whilst it’s doing this the water bubbles gently and is lit pink by an underwater LED. I felt a little apprehensive about the whole thing at this point, simply because it’s so unlike anything else I’ve done. I would class myself as an experienced novice at meditation. It has been a while since I maintained a regular practice, but I probably have a few hundred hours’ of zazen over the course of two decades. In theory the state inside the tank is one that you seek during meditation: a still place in which to be alone with the breath. But any meditator will tell you that it’s not <em>external</em> stimuli, but the mind, that presents the most persistent obstacle – and I was due to take my mind in with me.</p>\n<p>My entry into the tank was graceless. Not only are the surfaces plastic, and as such kind of slippy like the average bathtub, but the water fights you immediately. The 300kg of magnesium sulfate dissolved in the 1,000L of water means you float like a rubber duck. Whilst bobbing around, trying to reach up behind me to pull the lid of the tank down, I felt as ridiculous as I likely looked.</p>\n<p>Once that was out of the way, I had a few moments to try and settle in. The pink light remained on in the pod, and the water continued to bubble gently around me. I considered and then rejected the earplugs that had been provided, and made several attempts to find a comfortable position for my arms. In the end I opted to have my hands resting underneath my head. And no sooner had I got that figured out, than the light and the pump shut off. Absolute darkness. Darkness that felt like it had a weight and texture. And complete silence unless I actively made a sound. I’ll admit that the nullification of my senses freaked me out at first. Understanding intellectually what the experience entails, and going into it, are two very different things.

I found that, just like meditation when you’re not in the habit, the trickiest part was remembering that there was nothing to do – nothing I <em>should</em> be doing. I, at least, am so accustomed to asking myself whether I’m doing any given task ‘correctly’ or ‘well’ that it becomes reflexive for those questions to arise consistently in my subconscious. Several times throughout the hour I caught myself wondering whether I was floating as I ‘should’ be, or if I was having the ‘right’ thoughts during the experience. In meditation you learn that the mind thinks like the lungs breathe and the heart beats – it happens naturally and it’s not something you can stop; the key is in how you direct you attention. I found floating to be a similar experience.</p>\n<p>I had heard beforehand that to many people the hour doesn’t feel like an hour. I didn’t sleep, as some people choose to do, but I did have the experience that the time seemed to pass quite quickly. I have certainly sat half hour sessions of zazen, with a sore lower back and numbing butt, that felt <em>a lot</em> longer. My uneducated guess is that this has something to do with how the mind processes time: that devoid of external stimulus your ability to approximate duration becomes increasingly inexact. When the water began to bubble gently, and then the pink light came on, I climbed (gracelessly) out of the pod. Momentarily it was odd to feel the weight of my own limbs again, and under my feet the grit of a little epsomite that dusted the floor. I showered once more, rinsing the salts off my skin and out of my hair, dressed, and made my way back out of the spa to surprisingly bright sunlight.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the day I felt calm, and more comfortable than normal moving at a slower pace, both physically and mentally.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-3\">20. Run The Jewels — <em>Run the Jewels 3</em></h3>\n<p>As I write this Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Damn</em> is topping year-end lists left and right and I’m wondering what I missed on an album I just didn’t connect with. Of the hip-hop that passed through my headphones this year I had a good time with Vince Staples’s <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, really liked Open Mike Eagle’s <em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em> (but spent too little time with it), and bounced off most of the big hitters to one degree or another: as well as <em>Damn</em>, Jay-Z’s lukewarm <em>4:44</em> and Drake’s <em>More Life</em> did little for me, and I’ve never clicked with the Migos thing.</p>\n<p>That leaves room for only one rap record on this year’s list, but it’s a doozy. RTJ remain a complete enigma to me: I don’t know how they came together, I don’t know why they give every record away instead of selling them, and I don’t know why their combo of braggadocio, political engagement, and downright silliness works (this is a mix that only seems to work in hip-hop, with Beastie Boys as perhaps the flag-bearers) – I’m just grateful for it all.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Legend Has It’ is one of my most quoted songs of the year (for better or worse). It’s just the right mix of all the magic elements that make RTJ special. The moment when El P’s girlfriend interrupts to stop him completing one particularly crude line makes me smile, if not laugh, every time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-portico-quartet--art-in-the-age-of-automation\">19. Portico Quartet — <em>Art in the Age of Automation</em></h3>\n<p>There were three records this year that I returned to time and again for a dose of calm, reflective ambience: one didn’t quite make the list (Andrew Bird’s <em>Echolocations: River</em>), one is further up this list, and the latest from Portico Quartet is the third.\nOnce again a four-piece following the departure of founding member Nick Mulvey and one record as a trio (renamed, simply Portico), <em>AitAoA</em> finds the band taking another progressive step with their sound. When they took 8th spot on my list in 2012 (with their eponymous LP), I ended my write-up by saying I was excited to see what was next. Actually, 2015’s <em>Living Fields</em> didn’t quite chime for me – essentially an electronica album, with some guest vocals I could live without, it felt like a band deliberately trying to make a clean break with the past, and ignoring their strengths to do so. This year’s record (following the addition to the roster of Kier Vine) feels like a very deliberate further sonic evolution, which brings back the more organic instrumentation and cuts the vocals. It’s precisely what I wanted from the follow up to Portico Quartet, and perhaps their strongest album to date.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Current History’ takes as its base an effervescent, <em>Amnesiac</em>-style percussion pattern and layers tones and loops on top.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-death-from-above--outrage-is-now\">18. Death From Above — <em>Outrage! Is Now</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s something I wrote when DFA’s <em>The Physical World</em> took top spot in my list for 2014:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power is a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who knows what kind of albums this band could have made in the decade-long interval between their studio debut and its follow-up? Perhaps it took that time, and the up &amp; down intra-bandmate relationship, to make that second record. Whatever the case, I’m glad we didn’t have to wait so long for a third LP.</p>\n<p>Sebastien Grainger is a great drummer and Jesse F. Keeler is a great bassist; both have a great ear for infectious hooks, and they share a willingness to push their compositions as far as they’ll go: harder, faster, heavier, groovier. Perhaps the least talked about weapon in the band’s arsenal is Grainger’s voice; it’s a passionate, vaulting, wonderfully tuneful thing that serves as a solid third pillar in their song-craft.</p>\n<p><em>Outrage! Is Now</em> sounds like DFA. It sounds like someone lent them a couple of synths, but it’s unmistakably the same racket they made on the previous records. And man does it still get me!?</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Nvr 4Evr’ is classic DFA; the kind of track that bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club wish they’d written.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-beck--colors\">17. Beck — <em>Colors</em></h3>\n<p>Do you remember that part in <em>Superman Returns</em> where Lex Luther explains to Kitty Kowalski that crystals take on the properties of the elements that surround them? I feel that Beck operates in a similar fashion: whatever given sound or vibe he turns his attention to, he’s able to produce music that feels authentic. Sometimes it’s meditative (eg. <em>Sea Change</em> (2002)), sometimes a little sombre (eg. <em>Morning Phase</em> (2014)), and sometimes poppy and easygoing (eg. <em>Odelay</em> (1996) &amp; <em>Guero</em> (2005)). And no matter which category he’s playing in, Beck’s consistently doing something interesting with it. Whether it’s Brazilian influences on <em>Guero</em>, or the hip-hop touches to <em>The Information</em> (2006), Beck is a restlessly inventive artist in the same mould as Madonna or Björk (perhaps it’s something to do with the mononyms?).\n<em>Colors</em> is Beck in full-on pop assault mode. And he’s happy to pull from anywhere and everywhere to make it happen. Shamelessly detuned guitars and anthemic choruses; jaunty Beatles-esque piano; ’No Distraction’ sounds like Sting collaborating with The Killers.\nIn sum it’s the same trick that Daniel Johns et al managed to pull off with <em>Young Modern</em> (2007): the making of a pop album on one’s own artistic terms. It’s not quite as strange (or as sublime) as that Silverchair record, but both are unmistakably the work of diversely-talented musicians making a direct assault on whatever part of the brain responds to catchy pop music.</p>\n<p>Highlight: The panpipe melody that runs through title track ‘Colors’ – anything that can make me love the sound of an instrument I previously hated has to be doing something right.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-the-xx--i-see-you\">16. The xx — <em>I See You</em></h3>\n<p>To my ears the third album from The xx sounds like a natural progression of a sound that started off very simple and somewhat reserved, and has blossomed into a form somewhat brighter, self-assured, and colourful. It’s only natural, in fact, that the band’s third album as a trio takes notes from <em>In Colour</em>, Jamie xx’s vibrant, dance-floor friendly solo album of 2015 (#8 on that year’s List). The blaring horns that start the record were called out by several reviewers as a shock departure for The xx’s sound; but the shock was far less if you’d allowed Jamie’s solo LP to work its magic on you a couple of years previously.</p>\n<p>All of which is not to say that <em>I See You</em> sounds entirely different from its predecessors. The heart of the record is still the haunted, sleek blend of trip-hop and the lighter side of the EDM spectrum. And the songwriting is still coming from somewhere intensely personal. It’s not necessary to know about the friction between bandmates that sits behind tracks like ‘Say Something Loving’, and ‘Test Me’ in order to feel that these are songs crafted by people who felt them intensely.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘On Hold’ seemed a bit divisive when it was released ahead of the album, as it calls out the departures that The xx’s sound was taking on the record. Some reacted with shock or disappointment, but I was onboard immediately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-submerse--are-you-anywhere\">15. Submerse — <em>Are You Anywhere</em></h3>\n<p>For my money <em>Are You Anywhere</em> represents as strong a set of tracks as Submerse has released since I’ve been listening to him, starting with <em>Slow Waves</em> – which was my number 5 album of 2014. (<em>Stay Home</em> just missed out on a spot in 2015, and in 2016 he grabbed 13th for <em>Awake</em>.) Both the mix of organic &amp; electronic elements, and the dazed-sounding production, are familiar from previous albums, and the spell that’s cast here is just as effective on me as ever.</p>\n<p>In four albums and a couple of EPs over the last four years Submerse hasn’t really made much of a departure from his core sound. However, it’s a sound that I can’t get enough of, and my only complaint here is that 31 minutes is too short a time to spend in this sonic space.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Too Many Sidequests’ makes use of Submerse’s knack for incorporating video game sound effects into alien soundscapes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-inheaven--inheaven\">14. INHEAVEN — <em>INHEAVEN</em></h3>\n<p>What happened to The Subways? Wikipedia says they’re still extant, but nothing’s been released in 5 years, and I don’t remember hearing anything in nearly a decade. Anyway: INHEAVEN have made a pretty great record in the same mould, with perhaps a bit more Pixies influence (hence the name, I guess), and a bit more lightness in its step. It’s loud, it’s brash, and it’s unashamedly fun more-or-less from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Songs like ‘Treats’ &amp; ‘Vulture’ are designed for chanting along to, and I can’t listen to them without imagining what they would do to the front half of Brixton Academy. But this is a band that does have at least one gear above ‘simple crowd-pleasing stomper’ and it’s telling that several of the tracks here very quickly feel as though you’ve known them for a long time.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Stupid Things’ is half sickly-sweet pop song and half tender-hearted confession.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-toro-y-moi--boo-boo\">13. Toro y Moi — <em>Boo Boo</em></h3>\n<p>Chaz Bear took fourth spot in 2015 with <em>What For?</em>, and it’s largely the same formula of dreamy tones, soft beats, and lightly-treated vocals that has him back on the list this time. ‘Mirage’ kicks off the album as it means to go on, and when it pauses three minutes in for Chaz to intone “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there”, I 100% believe that this music is just the soundtrack to his life, and we’re just showing up to peep in for another 50 minute dose.</p>\n<p>The sound palate that <em>Boo Boo</em> shares with <em>What For?</em> is pretty singular – it’s identifiable within a couple of bars as TyM – and, as such, it’s likely to be a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Personally I find the relaxed, pastel-infused vibes on these records to be borderline medicinal.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Girl Like You’ sounds like an 80s chart pop song (which I absolutely do not intend as a pejorative) fed through Chaz’s particular filter, and it comes out sounding no less sweet but perhaps a bit more interesting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-charly-bliss--guppy\">12. Charly Bliss — <em>Guppy</em></h3>\n<p>Remember that dog. (mandatory lower case and full stop) – 90s grunge-influenced, optimismcore / original recipe emo LA outfit who released at least one and maybe two masterpieces on Geffen? There’s still a part of me that identifies strongly with late 90s cartoon misanthrope Daria, and in that guise I love both that dog. and, now, Charly Bliss. They’re from the other coast, and they’re 20 years late, but there’s no doubting they’re playing from the heart, and maybe that’s all you need to rekindle an old sound. It certainly worked on me instantly; there are guitar sounds on this record I haven’t heard since <em>Pinkerton</em> and, turns out, I’ve been missing them dearly.</p>\n<p>Infectious; exuberant; wilfully, naively upbeat… I need more of this sound in my life. There’s not much depth to what’s on offer here, but there doesn’t have to be. At least for a couple of records let’s just close our eyes and pretend it’s a couple of decades ago.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Ruby’ just might be my favourite song of the year. Pixies bass, vintage Weezer guitar, and one of the album’s best lilting, acrobatic vocals. If you’ll forgive the pun, it’s kind of blissful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-shigeto--the-new-monday\">11. Shigeto — <em>The New Monday</em></h3>\n<p>When I grow up I want to be Jason Heyward, five-time Gold Glove winner and flawless right-fielder for the Chicago Cubs. One of the many problems with that is that Heyward is eight years younger than me. So my second choice is Zachary Shigeto Saginaw. (I’m pretty sure Shigeto is also younger than me, but I don’t know that for a fact!)</p>\n<p>My first Shigeto record was <em>No Better Time Than Now</em>, 17th spot on this list for 2013, and I’ve been captivated ever since by his particular blend of electronica, hip-hop, and jazz. He’s endlessly inventive, effortlessly cool, and seemingly always able to capture a new sound or put a new spin on an old one. He’s also a ridiculous drummer. (I highly recommend watching some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DduNRXh3h3o\">videos of his live performances</a>.)</p>\n<p><em>The New Monday</em> is right up there with <em>No Better Time…</em> for me. I’m still listening to the earlier record, and I have no trouble believing I’ll still be playing this in five years.</p>\n<p>Highlight: Opener ‘Detroit Pt II’ is an evolution of one of <em>No Better Time Than Now’s</em> strongest tracks: ‘Detroit Pt I’.</p>\n<p>(Side note: Shigeto isn’t flawless. He put out another record this year as a duo with vocalist ZelooperZ, as ZGTO. I did not get on with that album at all! Still, even Jason Heyward drops a ball now and then.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-paramore--after-laughter\">10. Paramore — <em>After Laughter</em></h3>\n<p>On 2013’s list I excused Paramore’s inclusion at number 12 by joking that I am, in fact, a 15-year old girl. Quite why one tends to feel some form of guilt or shame for liking certain things, I don’t know. So in that spirit, though I might like to make another joke, I have to hold my hand up now and say that this band makes really good pop-rock albums, and I love them without reservation.</p>\n<p>There is likely nothing here to win over new fans. But, that said, there are some new departures in terms of sound. Overall the instrumentation feels more heavily weighted to electronic drums and synths where it would have been more uniformly guitars previously. Several of the tracks have a synthy, 80s vibe to them, telegraphed upfront by the Kraftwerk outro to opener ‘Hard Times’. Hayley Williams’s voice remains the group’s distinguishing factor, and is in fine form throughout here: by turns angry, soothing, empowered &amp; empowering, and never less than note-perfect.</p>\n<p>More of this please. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Fake Happy’ begins as an acoustic sketch and blossoms into a Cyndi Lauper-esque stomper straight from the heart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-arcade-fire--everything-now\">9. Arcade Fire — <em>Everything Now</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know how they do it, but every time a new Arcade Fire album comes out I go through a period of disappointment, which lasts a few listens, before ultimately it wins me over completely and captures top spot on my year-end list. Well, everything except the final part of that process happened this time around also.</p>\n<p>I think there’s something about AF’s music that has this polarising effect on listeners. Spin called <em>Everything Now</em> “deeply cynical” and “joyless”; Pitchfork termed it “pale” and “joyless”, and yet I honestly don’t know what they’re hearing that I’m not, or what I’m hearing that they’re not. There are at least three tracks here that rank among the most musically euphoric the band have ever recorded. Which is maybe why just as many reviewers gave opinions similar to that of Slant, who thought <em>Everything Now</em> “by far Arcade Fire&rsquo;s most upbeat… album to date”.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to disagree on the quality of an album, but in my experience this level of disparity on something like a record’s tone is very unusual. Maybe this is a band that makes emotionally confusing music, that takes the listener a while to catch up to.\nIn short, this is still a band without a bad song in their catalogue. ‘Everything Now’, ‘Creature Comfort’, and ‘Put Your Money on Me’ are some of the best songs they’ve recorded, and yet this is their weakest album as a whole. After <em>White Blood Cells</em> and <em>Elephant</em> sometimes there’s an <em>Icky Thump</em>; after <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em> you’re allowed to make <em>The King of Limbs</em>. In both cases, as here, those are very strong records outshone by all their siblings.</p>\n<p>Highlight: The slow build of the ABBA-indebted ‘Put Your Money on Me’ is masterly. How something can sound simultaneously sad and like an 80s disco classic is… confusing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-lusine--sensorimotor\">8. Lusine — <em>Sensorimotor</em></h3>\n<p>Back in March I was taking an early morning flight to the UK. It was due to depart Iceland at just after 06:00, which meant arriving at the airport sometime around 04:00; and to get to the airport there’s a ~45 minute coach ride from Reykjavik. That’s too early to pay attention to a podcast, or to concentrate on a book under some tiny, ineffective reading light. So I pressed play on a record I’d added to my library simply because I add everything that Ghostly International release to my library. It seems probable to me that <em>Sensorimotor</em> will always remind me of that drive out to the airport in the early morning dark. That’s just what the album sounds like to me now.\nThe backbone of the record is a collection of bass beats and superior electronic sweeps. Out of which are composed a series of haunted sonic landscapes that feel monochromatic and restless, like a brain roused too early from sleep it would prefer to return to.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Slow Motion’ is a bundle of nervous energy laid over a kick that sounds like a skipping heartbeat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-four-tet--new-energy\">7. Four Tet — <em>New Energy</em></h3>\n<p>I’ve been listening to Four Tet now for a little less than 15 years. In that time there have been some notable shifts in focus for the music that Kieran Hebden is creating. <em>Rounds</em> (2003) was the record that kicked off my interest, and is still held as the epitome of a certain (now possibly extinct?) sub-sub-genre somewhat awkwardly termed &lsquo;folktronica&rsquo;. <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> (2005) was vibrant and urgent, and in some ways presaged the shift that followed it. <em>There is Love in You</em> (2010) &amp; <em>Pink</em> (2012) felt more like collections of tracks designed for the dance-floor. Not that they weren’t enjoyable coming through headphones or home speakers, just that the records themselves felt a little less cohesive even if they still retained the power to excite and move. This period was capped off with <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> (2013), which felt like the culmination of that particular sound for Hebden. The bifurcated nature of the EP <em>Morning / Evening</em> (2015) was a leading sign of the next shift that Four Tet’s music would take.</p>\n<p>To me, even on first listen, <em>New Energy</em> feels like that latest sound’s full arrival. Unmistakably there are call-backs to what has come before – in fact the sound might best be thought of as a seamless amalgamation of everything Four Tet has released to this point. And that’s some feat. This is a complex, multi-layered work that bears repeated listening, but which engages the listener on a very human level. Warm, open, and never less than a joy to listen to.</p>\n<p>Highlight: Tough to pick one, but right now the steady, hypnotic ebb of ‘Daughter’ is my favourite. That will change tomorrow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-st-vincent--masseduction\">6. St. Vincent — <em>MASSEDUCTION</em></h3>\n<p>Annie Clark nabbed second spot in 2014 with her previous, eponymous album; I’ve been waiting impatiently ever since to find out what would come next. The answer, it seems, is another very fine collection of postmodern agit-pop that contains more ideas in each song than many bands have on a record.</p>\n<p>For me, there’s no ‘Digital Witness’ here, and perhaps not quite a ‘Birth in Reverse’, but this is one of those cases where comparison purely to the artist’s own catalogue gives a misleading picture. Simply put: not many musicians are making music like Annie Clark. Maybe it feels particularly acute in the post-Bowie / post-Prince world, but I find myself at pains to find and applaud this kind of brave, soul-searching, uncomfortable artistry. St. Vincent is an artist working in rarified air, way up there on the art-rock mountain. I will gladly continue to receive any and every transmission she sends down to us.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ’Pills’ is the off-kilter, whirligig result of Clark processing the modern condition, both her own and society’s. It’s wild-eyed and sarcastic, but also compassionate. (I recommend <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/st-vincents-seduction-and-my-mothers-career-at-playboy\">Clark’s appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour</a>, where she talks about the record and this song in particular.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-sampha--process\">5. Sampha — <em>Process</em></h3>\n<p>I knew Sampha’s voice from no fewer than three 5-star tracks on SBTRKT’s 2014 record <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em> (#3 on my list that year), and a feature on Kanye’s ‘Saint Pablo’. Additionally, though the exact vector escapes me now, somehow I heard Sampha’s track ‘Blood on Me’ toward the end of last year, and knew I had to look out for the album. That song has lost none of its power for me, and is surrounded here by immaculate pieces of songwriting that balance strength and tenderness both sonically and lyrically. Warm beats matched with soft tones play host to Sampha’s voice, which is perhaps the album’s most singular instrument as it floats above the music and dips down into it to play amongst the melodies. Throughout it’s a spectacularly accomplished and self-assured debut, clearly the product of a phenomenally talented musician bringing forth precisely the sound that’s in his head.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano’ is one of those tracks where a musician strips everything back to voice and one instrument and leaves you in awe. As emotionally raw as it is stark in its composition; it’s a striking moment at the centre of the album.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-fazerdaze--morningside\">4. Fazerdaze — <em>Morningside</em></h3>\n<p>There are some albums that you want to live inside. Imbued with warmth and brightness throughout, and a sense of weightless flow, <em>Morningside</em> joins my shortlist.\nThere are elements of shoegaze to the sound, particularly in the way the vocals are treated, but the relative sparseness of the instrumentation and lightness of the production leaves the record feeling open and inviting. It’s notable that several of the tracks get their pace from prominent bass lines that are very effective despite (or perhaps because of) their simplicity. There’s not a great variety to the sound, but the record is only just over the half-hour mark and at ~3 minutes per song it can feel as though each track is a variation on a theme. The result is an understated gem of an indie pop record that I expect to be playing for some time to come.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Lucky Girl’ is perhaps the most distilled form of the record’s sound, and eminently danceable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-bing--ruth--no-home-of-the-mind\">3. Bing &amp; Ruth — <em>No Home of the Mind</em></h3>\n<p>I know very little about the artist(s) behind this record, and I realise that I’ve unconsciously been safeguarding that ignorance so as not to spoil the mystique. This is ambient, post-classic music of precisely the kind I feel most in tune with. By turns haunting, uplifting, and meditative, these are pieces of tremendously adroit, understated composition. The piano is at each track’s centre, but is often found drifting in a sea of warm, shifting tones. The more I listened to it I started to feel as though this album sits somewhere halfway between the Radiohead of ‘Videotape’ &amp; ‘Give Up the Ghost’, and William Basinski’s <em>The Disintegration Loops</em>. It’s a more abstracted version of the former, which retains more of its formal integrity than that latter. And, similar to Basinski’s pieces, I’d be quite happy to play this for hours.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘The How of it Sped’ sounds as though it is accompanying some moment of heartbreak from an unseen film.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-joywave--content\">2. Joywave — <em>Content</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t know what to do with this record. It snuck up on me. Joywave have one previous album to their name, which remains unknown to me because I have enough on my plate trying to digest this one.</p>\n<p>Comprising an eclectic sound palate (including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…) <em>Content</em> is mercurial in the extreme. The post-nu-metal riff that closes the otherwise danceable paean to lost innocence ‘Rumors’ doesn’t belong on the same album as the quiet, solo-piano lament of ‘Confidence’. But they’re actually sequenced right next to each other. And the latter is 48 seconds long. And it works!\nThere are obvious allusions to Radiohead circa <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) here, but Joywave occupy a dancier, groovier space than the Oxford set. Lyrically though, they’re dealing with similar themes – technology and its effect on humanity, feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-worth – and, being something like 25 years younger, coming at them from a different point of view.</p>\n<p>I find this record fascinating, and this band very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘Going to a Place’ sounds like Keane got trapped in another dimension and sent a cry for help… and then it completely switches up half-way through and becomes something transportive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-jay-som--everybody-works\">1. Jay Som — <em>Everybody Works</em></h3>\n<p>Not infrequently it still amazes me what can come out of one person’s bedroom. Speaking personally for a moment, as someone who has spent the past year coming to terms with their own artistic limitations, it’s nothing short of astounding to me that one person, skilled in the use of the tools of a craft, can bring something as beautiful as <em>Everybody Works</em> forth from nothing.</p>\n<p>I could list some presumed influences on this record (shoegaze &amp; post-rock for example) but there’s at least a half-dozen distinct genres in the blend here. The result is an album that feels truly singular and of a piece to me: a 36 minute work of artistic expression, filled with human warmth, colour, and feeling.</p>\n<p>Highlight: ‘One More Time, Please’ is a perfect microcosm of the record in some respects. A disarming vocal, shining keys, and subtle low-key percussion, which all builds to a crescendoing guitar solo. Every note of every instrument performed by a 22 year old in her bedroom, sending something remarkable out into the world.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most.

Run The Jewels — *Run the Jewels 3*\n\nAs I write this Kendrick Lamar’s *Damn* is topping year-end lists left and right and I’m wondering what I missed on an album I just didn’t connect with. Of the hip-hop that passed through my headphones this year I had a good time with Vince Staples’s *Big Fish Theory*, really liked Open Mike Eagle’s *Brick Body Kids Still Daydream* (but spent too little time with it), and bounced off most of the big hitters to one degree or another: as well as *Damn*, Jay-Z’s lukewarm *4:44* and Drake’s *More Life* did little for me, and I’ve never clicked with the Migos thing. \n\nThat leaves room for only one rap record on this year’s list, but it’s a doozy. RTJ remain a complete enigma to me: I don’t know how they came together, I don’t know why they give every record away instead of selling them, and I don’t know why their combo of braggadocio, political engagement, and downright silliness works (this is a mix that only seems to work in hip-hop, with Beastie Boys as perhaps the flag-bearers) – I’m just grateful for it all. \n\nHighlight: ‘Legend Has It’ is one of my most quoted songs of the year (for better or worse). It’s just the right mix of all the magic elements that make RTJ special. The moment when El P’s girlfriend interrupts to stop him completing one particularly crude line makes me smile, if not laugh, every time.\n\n\n###  19. Portico Quartet — *Art in the Age of Automation*\n\nThere were three records this year that I returned to time and again for a dose of calm, reflective ambience: one didn’t quite make the list (Andrew Bird’s *Echolocations: River*), one is further up this list, and the latest from Portico Quartet is the third.\nOnce again a four-piece following the departure of founding member Nick Mulvey and one record as a trio (renamed, simply Portico), *AitAoA* finds the band taking another progressive step with their sound. When they took 8th spot on my list in 2012 (with their eponymous LP), I ended my write-up by saying I was excited to see what was next. Actually, 2015’s *Living Fields* didn’t quite chime for me – essentially an electronica album, with some guest vocals I could live without, it felt like a band deliberately trying to make a clean break with the past, and ignoring their strengths to do so. This year’s record (following the addition to the roster of Kier Vine) feels like a very deliberate further sonic evolution, which brings back the more organic instrumentation and cuts the vocals. It’s precisely what I wanted from the follow up to Portico Quartet, and perhaps their strongest album to date.\n\nHighlight: ‘Current History’ takes as its base an effervescent, *Amnesiac*-style percussion pattern and layers tones and loops on top. \n\n\n###  18. Death From Above — *Outrage! Is Now*\n\nHere’s something I wrote when DFA’s *The Physical World* took top spot in my list for 2014:\n\n> It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of this second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of the first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve the band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power is a kind of compound triptych miracle. \n\nWho knows what kind of albums this band could have made in the decade-long interval between their studio debut and its follow-up? Perhaps it took that time, and the up & down intra-bandmate relationship, to make that second record. Whatever the case, I’m glad we didn’t have to wait so long for a third LP. \n\nSebastien Grainger is a great drummer and Jesse F. Keeler is a great bassist; both have a great ear for infectious hooks, and they share a willingness to push their compositions as far as they’ll go: harder, faster, heavier, groovier. Perhaps the least talked about weapon in the band’s arsenal is Grainger’s voice; it’s a passionate, vaulting, wonderfully tuneful thing that serves as a solid third pillar in their song-craft. \n\n*Outrage! Is Now* sounds like DFA. It sounds like someone lent them a couple of synths, but it’s unmistakably the same racket they made on the previous records. And man does it still get me!?\n\nHighlight: ‘Nvr 4Evr’ is classic DFA; the kind of track that bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club wish they’d written. \n\n\n###  17. Beck — *Colors*\n\nDo you remember that part in *Superman Returns* where Lex Luther explains to Kitty Kowalski that crystals take on the properties of the elements that surround them? I feel that Beck operates in a similar fashion: whatever given sound or vibe he turns his attention to, he’s able to produce music that feels authentic. Sometimes it’s meditative (eg. *Sea Change* (2002)), sometimes a little sombre (eg. *Morning Phase* (2014)), and sometimes poppy and easygoing (eg. *Odelay* (1996) & *Guero* (2005)). And no matter which category he’s playing in, Beck’s consistently doing something interesting with it. Whether it’s Brazilian influences on *Guero*, or the hip-hop touches to *The Information* (2006), Beck is a restlessly inventive artist in the same mould as Madonna or Björk (perhaps it’s something to do with the mononyms?). \n*Colors* is Beck in full-on pop assault mode. And he’s happy to pull from anywhere and everywhere to make it happen. Shamelessly detuned guitars and anthemic choruses; jaunty Beatles-esque piano; ’No Distraction’ sounds like Sting collaborating with The Killers. \nIn sum it’s the same trick that Daniel Johns et al managed to pull off with *Young Modern* (2007): the making of a pop album on one’s own artistic terms. It’s not quite as strange (or as sublime) as that Silverchair record, but both are unmistakably the work of diversely-talented musicians making a direct assault on whatever part of the brain responds to catchy pop music. \n\nHighlight: The panpipe melody that runs through title track ‘Colors’ – anything that can make me love the sound of an instrument I previously hated has to be doing something right.\n\n\n###  16. The xx — *I See You*\n\nTo my ears the third album from The xx sounds like a natural progression of a sound that started off very simple and somewhat reserved, and has blossomed into a form somewhat brighter, self-assured, and colourful. It’s only natural, in fact, that the band’s third album as a trio takes notes from *In Colour*, Jamie xx’s vibrant, dance-floor friendly solo album of 2015 (#8 on that year’s List). The blaring horns that start the record were called out by several reviewers as a shock departure for The xx’s sound; but the shock was far less if you’d allowed Jamie’s solo LP to work its magic on you a couple of years previously. \n\nAll of which is not to say that *I See You* sounds entirely different from its predecessors. The heart of the record is still the haunted, sleek blend of trip-hop and the lighter side of the EDM spectrum. And the songwriting is still coming from somewhere intensely personal. It’s not necessary to know about the friction between bandmates that sits behind tracks like ‘Say Something Loving’, and ‘Test Me’ in order to feel that these are songs crafted by people who felt them intensely. \n\nHighlight: ‘On Hold’ seemed a bit divisive when it was released ahead of the album, as it calls out the departures that The xx’s sound was taking on the record. Some reacted with shock or disappointment, but I was onboard immediately. \n\n\n###  15. Submerse — *Are You Anywhere*\n\nFor my money *Are You Anywhere* represents as strong a set of tracks as Submerse has released since I’ve been listening to him, starting with *Slow Waves* – which was my number 5 album of 2014. (*Stay Home* just missed out on a spot in 2015, and in 2016 he grabbed 13th for *Awake*.) Both the mix of organic & electronic elements, and the dazed-sounding production, are familiar from previous albums, and the spell that’s cast here is just as effective on me as ever. \n\nIn four albums and a couple of EPs over the last four years Submerse hasn’t really made much of a departure from his core sound. However, it’s a sound that I can’t get enough of, and my only complaint here is that 31 minutes is too short a time to spend in this sonic space.\n\nHighlight: ‘Too Many Sidequests’ makes use of Submerse’s knack for incorporating video game sound effects into alien soundscapes.\n\n\n###  14. INHEAVEN — *INHEAVEN*\n\nWhat happened to The Subways? Wikipedia says they’re still extant, but nothing’s been released in 5 years, and I don’t remember hearing anything in nearly a decade. Anyway: INHEAVEN have made a pretty great record in the same mould, with perhaps a bit more Pixies influence (hence the name, I guess), and a bit more lightness in its step. It’s loud, it’s brash, and it’s unashamedly fun more-or-less from start to finish. \n\nSongs like ‘Treats’ & ‘Vulture’ are designed for chanting along to, and I can’t listen to them without imagining what they would do to the front half of Brixton Academy. But this is a band that does have at least one gear above ‘simple crowd-pleasing stomper’ and it’s telling that several of the tracks here very quickly feel as though you’ve known them for a long time. \n\nHighlight: ‘Stupid Things’ is half sickly-sweet pop song and half tender-hearted confession. \n\n\n###  13. Toro y Moi — *Boo Boo*\n\nChaz Bear took fourth spot in 2015 with *What For?*, and it’s largely the same formula of dreamy tones, soft beats, and lightly-treated vocals that has him back on the list this time. ‘Mirage’ kicks off the album as it means to go on, and when it pauses three minutes in for Chaz to intone “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there”, I 100% believe that this music is just the soundtrack to his life, and we’re just showing up to peep in for another 50 minute dose. \n\nThe sound palate that *Boo Boo* shares with *What For?* is pretty singular – it’s identifiable within a couple of bars as TyM – and, as such, it’s likely to be a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Personally I find the relaxed, pastel-infused vibes on these records to be borderline medicinal. \n\nHighlight: ‘Girl Like You’ sounds like an 80s chart pop song (which I absolutely do not intend as a pejorative) fed through Chaz’s particular filter, and it comes out sounding no less sweet but perhaps a bit more interesting. \n\n\n###  12. Charly Bliss — *Guppy*\n\nRemember that dog. (mandatory lower case and full stop) – 90s grunge-influenced, optimismcore / original recipe emo LA outfit who released at least one and maybe two masterpieces on Geffen? There’s still a part of me that identifies strongly with late 90s cartoon misanthrope Daria, and in that guise I love both that dog. and, now, Charly Bliss. They’re from the other coast, and they’re 20 years late, but there’s no doubting they’re playing from the heart, and maybe that’s all you need to rekindle an old sound. It certainly worked on me instantly; there are guitar sounds on this record I haven’t heard since *Pinkerton* and, turns out, I’ve been missing them dearly.\n \nInfectious; exuberant; wilfully, naively upbeat… I need more of this sound in my life. There’s not much depth to what’s on offer here, but there doesn’t have to be. At least for a couple of records let’s just close our eyes and pretend it’s a couple of decades ago. \n\nHighlight: ‘Ruby’ just might be my favourite song of the year. Pixies bass, vintage Weezer guitar, and one of the album’s best lilting, acrobatic vocals. If you’ll forgive the pun, it’s kind of blissful. \n\n\n###  11. Shigeto — *The New Monday*\n\nWhen I grow up I want to be Jason Heyward, five-time Gold Glove winner and flawless right-fielder for the Chicago Cubs. One of the many problems with that is that Heyward is eight years younger than me. So my second choice is Zachary Shigeto Saginaw. (I’m pretty sure Shigeto is also younger than me, but I don’t know that for a fact!)\n\nMy first Shigeto record was *No Better Time Than Now*, 17th spot on this list for 2013, and I’ve been captivated ever since by his particular blend of electronica, hip-hop, and jazz. He’s endlessly inventive, effortlessly cool, and seemingly always able to capture a new sound or put a new spin on an old one. He’s also a ridiculous drummer. (I highly recommend watching some [videos of his live performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DduNRXh3h3o).)\n\n*The New Monday* is right up there with *No Better Time…* for me. I’m still listening to the earlier record, and I have no trouble believing I’ll still be playing this in five years. \n\nHighlight: Opener ‘Detroit Pt II’ is an evolution of one of *No Better Time Than Now’s* strongest tracks: ‘Detroit Pt I’. \n\n(Side note: Shigeto isn’t flawless. He put out another record this year as a duo with vocalist ZelooperZ, as ZGTO. I did not get on with that album at all! Still, even Jason Heyward drops a ball now and then.)\n\n\n###  10. Paramore — *After Laughter*\n\nOn 2013’s list I excused Paramore’s inclusion at number 12 by joking that I am, in fact, a 15-year old girl. Quite why one tends to feel some form of guilt or shame for liking certain things, I don’t know. So in that spirit, though I might like to make another joke, I have to hold my hand up now and say that this band makes really good pop-rock albums, and I love them without reservation. \n\nThere is likely nothing here to win over new fans. But, that said, there are some new departures in terms of sound. Overall the instrumentation feels more heavily weighted to electronic drums and synths where it would have been more uniformly guitars previously. Several of the tracks have a synthy, 80s vibe to them, telegraphed upfront by the Kraftwerk outro to opener ‘Hard Times’. Hayley Williams’s voice remains the group’s distinguishing factor, and is in fine form throughout here: by turns angry, soothing, empowered & empowering, and never less than note-perfect. \n\nMore of this please. Thanks.\n\nHighlight: ‘Fake Happy’ begins as an acoustic sketch and blossoms into a Cyndi Lauper-esque stomper straight from the heart. \n\n\n###  9. Arcade Fire — *Everything Now*\n\nI don’t know how they do it, but every time a new Arcade Fire album comes out I go through a period of disappointment, which lasts a few listens, before ultimately it wins me over completely and captures top spot on my year-end list. Well, everything except the final part of that process happened this time around also. \n\nI think there’s something about AF’s music that has this polarising effect on listeners. Spin called *Everything Now* “deeply cynical” and “joyless”; Pitchfork termed it “pale” and “joyless”, and yet I honestly don’t know what they’re hearing that I’m not, or what I’m hearing that they’re not. There are at least three tracks here that rank among the most musically euphoric the band have ever recorded. Which is maybe why just as many reviewers gave opinions similar to that of Slant, who thought *Everything Now* “by far Arcade Fire's most upbeat… album to date”.\n\nIt’s one thing to disagree on the quality of an album, but in my experience this level of disparity on something like a record’s tone is very unusual. Maybe this is a band that makes emotionally confusing music, that takes the listener a while to catch up to. \nIn short, this is still a band without a bad song in their catalogue. ‘Everything Now’, ‘Creature Comfort’, and ‘Put Your Money on Me’ are some of the best songs they’ve recorded, and yet this is their weakest album as a whole. After *White Blood Cells* and *Elephant* sometimes there’s an *Icky Thump*; after *OK Computer* and *Kid A* you’re allowed to make *The King of Limbs*. In both cases, as here, those are very strong records outshone by all their siblings.\n\nHighlight: The slow build of the ABBA-indebted ‘Put Your Money on Me’ is masterly. How something can sound simultaneously sad and like an 80s disco classic is… confusing. \n\n\n###  8. Lusine — *Sensorimotor*\n\nBack in March I was taking an early morning flight to the UK. It was due to depart Iceland at just after 06:00, which meant arriving at the airport sometime around 04:00; and to get to the airport there’s a ~45 minute coach ride from Reykjavik. That’s too early to pay attention to a podcast, or to concentrate on a book under some tiny, ineffective reading light. So I pressed play on a record I’d added to my library simply because I add everything that Ghostly International release to my library. It seems probable to me that *Sensorimotor* will always remind me of that drive out to the airport in the early morning dark. That’s just what the album sounds like to me now. \nThe backbone of the record is a collection of bass beats and superior electronic sweeps. Out of which are composed a series of haunted sonic landscapes that feel monochromatic and restless, like a brain roused too early from sleep it would prefer to return to. \n\nHighlight: ‘Slow Motion’ is a bundle of nervous energy laid over a kick that sounds like a skipping heartbeat. \n\n\n###  7. Four Tet — *New Energy*\n\nI’ve been listening to Four Tet now for a little less than 15 years. In that time there have been some notable shifts in focus for the music that Kieran Hebden is creating. *Rounds* (2003) was the record that kicked off my interest, and is still held as the epitome of a certain (now possibly extinct?) sub-sub-genre somewhat awkwardly termed 'folktronica'. *Everything Ecstatic* (2005) was vibrant and urgent, and in some ways presaged the shift that followed it. *There is Love in You* (2010) & *Pink* (2012) felt more like collections of tracks designed for the dance-floor. Not that they weren’t enjoyable coming through headphones or home speakers, just that the records themselves felt a little less cohesive even if they still retained the power to excite and move. This period was capped off with *Beautiful Rewind* (2013), which felt like the culmination of that particular sound for Hebden. The bifurcated nature of the EP *Morning / Evening* (2015) was a leading sign of the next shift that Four Tet’s music would take. \n\nTo me, even on first listen, *New Energy* feels like that latest sound’s full arrival. Unmistakably there are call-backs to what has come before – in fact the sound might best be thought of as a seamless amalgamation of everything Four Tet has released to this point. And that’s some feat. This is a complex, multi-layered work that bears repeated listening, but which engages the listener on a very human level. Warm, open, and never less than a joy to listen to. \n\nHighlight: Tough to pick one, but right now the steady, hypnotic ebb of ‘Daughter’ is my favourite. That will change tomorrow. \n\n\n###  6. St. Vincent — *MASSEDUCTION*\n\nAnnie Clark nabbed second spot in 2014 with her previous, eponymous album; I’ve been waiting impatiently ever since to find out what would come next. The answer, it seems, is another very fine collection of postmodern agit-pop that contains more ideas in each song than many bands have on a record. \n\nFor me, there’s no ‘Digital Witness’ here, and perhaps not quite a ‘Birth in Reverse’, but this is one of those cases where comparison purely to the artist’s own catalogue gives a misleading picture. Simply put: not many musicians are making music like Annie Clark. Maybe it feels particularly acute in the post-Bowie / post-Prince world, but I find myself at pains to find and applaud this kind of brave, soul-searching, uncomfortable artistry. St. Vincent is an artist working in rarified air, way up there on the art-rock mountain. I will gladly continue to receive any and every transmission she sends down to us. \n\nHighlight: ’Pills’ is the off-kilter, whirligig result of Clark processing the modern condition, both her own and society’s. It’s wild-eyed and sarcastic, but also compassionate. (I recommend [Clark’s appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/st-vincents-seduction-and-my-mothers-career-at-playboy), where she talks about the record and this song in particular.)\n\n\n###  5. Sampha — *Process*\n\nI knew Sampha’s voice from no fewer than three 5-star tracks on SBTRKT’s 2014 record *Wonder Where We’ll Land* (#3 on my list that year), and a feature on Kanye’s ‘Saint Pablo’. Additionally, though the exact vector escapes me now, somehow I heard Sampha’s track ‘Blood on Me’ toward the end of last year, and knew I had to look out for the album. That song has lost none of its power for me, and is surrounded here by immaculate pieces of songwriting that balance strength and tenderness both sonically and lyrically. Warm beats matched with soft tones play host to Sampha’s voice, which is perhaps the album’s most singular instrument as it floats above the music and dips down into it to play amongst the melodies. Throughout it’s a spectacularly accomplished and self-assured debut, clearly the product of a phenomenally talented musician bringing forth precisely the sound that’s in his head.\n\nHighlight: ‘(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano’ is one of those tracks where a musician strips everything back to voice and one instrument and leaves you in awe. As emotionally raw as it is stark in its composition; it’s a striking moment at the centre of the album. \n\n\n###  4. Fazerdaze — *Morningside*\n\nThere are some albums that you want to live inside. Imbued with warmth and brightness throughout, and a sense of weightless flow, *Morningside* joins my shortlist. \nThere are elements of shoegaze to the sound, particularly in the way the vocals are treated, but the relative sparseness of the instrumentation and lightness of the production leaves the record feeling open and inviting. It’s notable that several of the tracks get their pace from prominent bass lines that are very effective despite (or perhaps because of) their simplicity. There’s not a great variety to the sound, but the record is only just over the half-hour mark and at ~3 minutes per song it can feel as though each track is a variation on a theme. The result is an understated gem of an indie pop record that I expect to be playing for some time to come.\n\nHighlight: ‘Lucky Girl’ is perhaps the most distilled form of the record’s sound, and eminently danceable.\n\n\n###  3. Bing & Ruth — *No Home of the Mind*\n\nI know very little about the artist(s) behind this record, and I realise that I’ve unconsciously been safeguarding that ignorance so as not to spoil the mystique. This is ambient, post-classic music of precisely the kind I feel most in tune with. By turns haunting, uplifting, and meditative, these are pieces of tremendously adroit, understated composition. The piano is at each track’s centre, but is often found drifting in a sea of warm, shifting tones. The more I listened to it I started to feel as though this album sits somewhere halfway between the Radiohead of ‘Videotape’ & ‘Give Up the Ghost’, and William Basinski’s *The Disintegration Loops*. It’s a more abstracted version of the former, which retains more of its formal integrity than that latter. And, similar to Basinski’s pieces, I’d be quite happy to play this for hours. \n\nHighlight: ‘The How of it Sped’ sounds as though it is accompanying some moment of heartbreak from an unseen film. \n\n\n###  2. Joywave — *Content*\n\nI don’t know what to do with this record. It snuck up on me. Joywave have one previous album to their name, which remains unknown to me because I have enough on my plate trying to digest this one. \n\nComprising an eclectic sound palate (including, but not limited to: math rock, electronica, dance, soul…) *Content* is mercurial in the extreme. The post-nu-metal riff that closes the otherwise danceable paean to lost innocence ‘Rumors’ doesn’t belong on the same album as the quiet, solo-piano lament of ‘Confidence’. But they’re actually sequenced right next to each other. And the latter is 48 seconds long. And it works!\nThere are obvious allusions to Radiohead circa *OK Computer* (1997) here, but Joywave occupy a dancier, groovier space than the Oxford set. Lyrically though, they’re dealing with similar themes – technology and its effect on humanity, feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-worth – and, being something like 25 years younger, coming at them from a different point of view.\n\nI find this record fascinating, and this band very exciting if they’re going to keep making music this inventive and urgent.\n\nHighlight: ‘Going to a Place’ sounds like Keane got trapped in another dimension and sent a cry for help… and then it completely switches up half-way through and becomes something transportive. \n\n\n### 1. Jay Som — *Everybody Works*\n\nNot infrequently it still amazes me what can come out of one person’s bedroom. Speaking personally for a moment, as someone who has spent the past year coming to terms with their own artistic limitations, it’s nothing short of astounding to me that one person, skilled in the use of the tools of a craft, can bring something as beautiful as *Everybody Works* forth from nothing. \n\nI could list some presumed influences on this record (shoegaze & post-rock for example) but there’s at least a half-dozen distinct genres in the blend here. The result is an album that feels truly singular and of a piece to me: a 36 minute work of artistic expression, filled with human warmth, colour, and feeling. \n\nHighlight: ‘One More Time, Please’ is a perfect microcosm of the record in some respects. A disarming vocal, shining keys, and subtle low-key percussion, which all builds to a crescendoing guitar solo. Every note of every instrument performed by a 22 year old in her bedroom, sending something remarkable out into the world.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-deftones--gore\">20. Deftones — <em>Gore</em></h3>\n<p>Deftones topped 2012’s List with <em>Koi No Yokan</em> after a stretch of three albums in ten years that\ndidn&rsquo;t live up to the promise of 2000’s career-defining <em>White Pony</em>. Four years\nlater I’m happy to find <em>Gore</em> again hitting all of the right notes and innovating a\nlittle further sonically to keep them where they belong (as pretty much the\nonly heavy rock act I pay attention to any more). <em>Gore</em> is the first album to be\nreleased since the death of original bassist Chi Cheng in 2013 (following the\ncar crash in 2008 that left him in a coma). As such it is necessarily coloured\n(particularly lyrically) by Chino Moreno dealing with the final loss of his friend\nand bandmate. As with much of Deftones’ previous work, there is an expert\nblending of darkness &amp; anger with lighter, more emotionally nuanced\nelements that allow the band to access a lot of places that other acts in the\nsame space can&rsquo;t or don’t. There’s a finesse to their art, with Moreno’s voice\nstill setting the tone, and the instrumentation as adept as ever in supporting\nthe emotional direction(s) of the songs.</p>\n<p>Following Cheng’s death there has been talk of releasing the now legendary\n<em>Eros</em>, the album that was near-complete at the time of his accident. It would\nbe very interesting to know what a Deftones album recorded in 2008 would\nsound like were it released now. As it is, I’m just happy that the band are still\nmaking new music of this standard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-honeyblood--babes-never-die\">19. Honeyblood — <em>Babes Never Die</em></h3>\n<p>After a swelling intro, the title track establishes quickly exactly what kind of\nrecord Honeyblood have made: post-bubblegum garage pop, and throughout\na dozen tracks it’s delivered here in excellent form. Album high-point ‘Ready\nfor the Magic’ has detuned bass, handclaps, and a chorus to die for or dance\nto (take your pick). There are a couple of down-tempo moments (such as the\nMelvins-meet-Breeders dirge of ‘Love is a Disease’), but the main vibe is a\nkind of slant coyness, showcased in various attitudes from the sweeping\n‘Gangs’ to the low thrum of ‘Walking at Midnight’. Honeyblood know how to\ncraft a bridge, and at 39 minutes they also know how to get in and get out\nhaving delivered a few body blows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-chance-the-rapper--coloring-book\">18. Chance the Rapper — <em>Coloring Book</em></h3>\n<p>Spoilers: you’re not going to find Kanye West’s <em>The Life of Pablo</em> on this list. That\nrecord is overly long, very self-indulgent (as you might expect), occasionally\ntranscendently masterful, but often frustratingly pedestrian or confused. As\nevents surrounding its release may have hinted, and events since have\nconfirmed, Kanye isn’t in a great place right now, and personally I think that\ncontributed to <em>…Pablo</em> being a bit of a mess.</p>\n<p>Chance’s <em>Coloring Book</em> is the record I wish Kanye still feels he could make.\nIt’s the record that <em>Late Registration</em>-era Kanye could have put together in two\nweeks, but its relaxed attitude, sunny vibes, and good humour now seem\n(temporarily at least) beyond Chicago’s first son of rap; that baton has been\npassed, and Chance is running with it. Perhaps ironically it picks up precisely\nwhere Chance’s contribution to Kanye’s best track of 2016 — ‘Ultralight\nBeam’ — left off, and from there it soars through bouncy floor-fillers and\nrelaxed summer jams, rarely pausing to take a breath. With ‘Blessings’\nChance has fashioned perhaps what amounts to a sonic calling card: humble,\nnot overworked, relaxed, and fairly glowing right out the speakers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-thao--the-get-down-stay-down--a-man-alive\">17. Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down — <em>A Man Alive</em></h3>\n<p>30 seconds or so into album opener ‘Astonished Man’ one thinks ‘this sounds\nkinda like tUnE-yArDs’, and one is not wrong: produced by Merrill Garbus,\nthis set of quirky dark-pop belays her ear for space and gain, for fuzz and\nweird editing choices and for simple, driving percussion that holds down\nsomething otherwise less grounded. (‘Astonished Man’ was also the subject\nof an excellent <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/thao\">episode of Song Exploder</a> this year, which reveals the song’s\ndeeply-personal roots.) Thao’s voice is an instrument perfectly-suited to\nswitching from conversational to plaintive to innocent and sing-songy. It’s in\nparticularly good form somersaulting all over the Pixies-ish ‘The Evening’,\nwhich just about loses out on album-highlight honours in favour of the catchy\nmoodswing of ‘Nobody Dies’, which is possessed of the kind of chorus you’ll\nsing the first time, hum for days, and then just bellow out the next time you\nhear it. Every part of the band gets a moment to shine on <em>A Man Alive</em>, but I\nfound that my favourite moments were often the Regina Spektor-esque\nconfessional moments, such as on ‘Guts’ (the second-best song with that title\nin 2016). Come for the pop, stay for the barrage of interesting ideas and left-\nof-centre hooks.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-beyonce--lemonade\">16. Beyonce — <em>Lemonade</em></h3>\n<p>To this point Beyonce hasn’t been an album artist for me. There have been a\nhandful of singles through the years that have lit up my radar and caught in\nmy mind, but it hasn’t been enough to convince me to spend an hour with her\nmusic. The 65 minute music video that accompanied the release of\n<em>Lemonade</em> was more than enough to change my mind: beautiful, inventive,\nand extraordinarily accomplished, the first watch of that film remains one of\nmy cultural high-points of 2016. It also serves as an excellent showcase of\nwhat a diverse collection of music is to be found on the album itself. Hip-hop,\nR&amp;B, soul-flavours, a little country on ‘Daddy Lessons’, a pure-bred ballad\nlike ‘Sandcastles’, whatever garage rock-vibed thing Jack White’s helping bring\nforth on ‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’&hellip; there’s a lot here. And it’s all delivered with\nenergy to spare and immaculately produced. There’s also the much-\npublicised matter of the album’s central subject: her husband’s infidelity. It’s a\ntheme that provides the emotional fuel for all of the music here, and keeps\nit feeling honest, and it’s also the joining thread that runs through what\notherwise may have felt like a disparate collection of tracks. It should also be\nnoted that ‘Freedom’ is top 5 songs of the year material, and felt increasingly\nprophetic and necessary as 2016 wore on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-olafur-arnalds--nils-frahm--trance-frendz\">15. Olafur Arnalds &amp; Nils Frahm — <em>Trance Frendz</em></h3>\n<p>Arnalds’s solo record <em>&hellip;And They Have Escaped\nthe Weight of Darkness</em> places 12th on my List in 2010, and represents both my serious\nintroduction to his work and the reason I’ve followed him since. Nils Frahm\ntook a deserved 12th spot with <em>Solo</em> last year (a record given some new life\nthis year by the release of a kind of director’s cut edition: <em>Solo Remains</em>).\nTheir working together is the kind of partnership that seems so inevitable that\nit must surely have been a case of when as opposed to whether. Pleasingly,\nthe fruits of the partnership, whilst familiar-sounding, are different enough that\nthey seem unlikely to have ever emerged from one or other of the artists\nalone. Spare and delicate in composition as they both are they have taken\nobvious care not to do too much here, and to facilitate one another where it\nwould have been easy for toes to be trodden upon. An ill-fitting title (it would\nhave been incredible if they’d made a trance record though), inscrutable track\nnames, and an album cover that looks like something they decided wasn’t\nquite interesting enough to go on Instagram, is all par for the course, and all\nmeaningless once ‘20:17’ begins and you can forget everything else in the\nworld for three-quarters of an hour. Beautiful stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-flume--skin\">14. Flume — <em>Skin</em></h3>\n<p>The last few years I’ve seemingly latched on to at least one album of bright,\nwarm electronica that stays on heavy rotation for months. Fort Romeau’s\n<em>Insides</em> played the role last year, and it was SBTRKT’s sublime <em>Wonder\nWhere We&rsquo;ll Land</em> in 2014; this year the task falls to <em>Flume</em>. Similarly to that\nSBTRKT record this is a set of songs that benefit from a host of guest\nvocalists lending distinct flavours to a number of tracks throughout, but it’s all\nunderpinned with the a softly undulating blanket of pastel-coloured warmth\nthat ebbs and flows to its own hypnotising rhythm. Album-opener ‘Helix’\ncrests with a minute to go, and sets the relaxed tempo, then picked up by\nhighlight track ‘Never Be Like You’. Raekwon makes a notable appearance,\nand the record closes on a mellow high with Beck lending vocals to ‘Tiny\nCities’, but what kept this playing for me was the soundscape that Flume\nconjures throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-submerse--awake\">13. Submerse — <em>Awake</em></h3>\n<p>Submerse took 5th spot in 2014 with the wonderful <em>Slow Waves</em>, and whilst I\nenjoyed the follow-up (2015’s <em>Stay Home</em>) it just missed out on last year’s list.\n<em>Awake</em> finds Submerse back on The List and further securing his place as\none of my desert island artists. Ethereal opener &lsquo;Too Late, They’re Already\nHere’ is transportive, and gives way to perhaps my favourite Submerse track,\n‘Sidequests’: a shimmering pool of muted pops, shining chimes, and a mellow\nsynth are met by a minimal refrain in a climbing register. Like many of his\ntracks, it blends the electronic and the acoustic seamlessly into something\nunique-feeling and oddly alive. I listened to this set of tracks dozens of times\nthis year and found new things on each play through. At this point it would be\na shock if the next Submerse release sounded dramatically different to this,\nsince his recent output is all quite similar, but I’m excited for it regardless.\nThis is a sonic space I&rsquo;ll happily return to time and time again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-solange--a-seat-at-the-table\">12. Solange — <em>A Seat at the Table</em></h3>\n<p>Here’s something I’ve struggled with a bit this year: a prevailing sense that\nsome of the music I got the most enjoyment from is not intended for me.\nWhilst sensitive to cultural heritage I’m not a believer that such broad\ndistinctions as ‘white music’ and ‘black music’ exist; I don’t subscribe to the\nreductive idea that entire genres of music are the province of one set of\npeople or another. However, when an album like <em>A Seat at the Table</em> comes\nalong, and speaks in large part about the black experience, there’s a reflexive\nguilt and fear of cultural appropriation that rises in me at claiming it as one of\nmy favourite albums of the year. Oddly, this isn’t something that seems to\ntranslate to other media: I have no problem saying that Ta-Nehisi Coates’s\n<em>Between the World and Me</em> was one of the very best books I read this year, or\nthat <em>The Get Down</em> and <em>Atlanta</em> were two of my favourite TV shows of 2016 -\nall exemplary pieces of art that deal directly, primarily with black cultural\nhistory. Still, in the final analysis it would be disingenuous of me to leave\nSolange off this list. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is a collection of beautifully crafted,\nsoul-infused R&amp;B songs that mix the deeply personal with insightful social\ncommentary like few records I’ve heard the last couple of years. It is bold and\nvital, and despite all the ways in which it’s not for me it gave me too much not\nto recognise the important role it played in my listening in 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-angel-olsen--my-woman\">11. Angel Olsen — <em>MY WOMAN</em></h3>\n<p>What drew me to the (obligatorily fully capped-up) MY WOMAN in the first\nplace was catching the track ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ being played on Beats1. Had\nthe album been a wash that still would have been fine, since that one track — with it’s endearing mix of bokeh warmth and aching longing — ended up being\nprobably my favourite song of 2016. Fortunately there are plenty of other\ntreats in store on an album that puts garage pop-rock through its paces,\nwhilst bending it to all of its intended purposes: exciting, yearning,\ncommiserating, celebrating, and the painting of personal stories of loss and\nmisunderstanding in love. Olsen’s voice is the right balance between\nemotionally affected and lackadaisical, and her guitar is usually found in a\nsimilar (Ben Kweller-esque) attitude, moving between relaxed strum and\nenergised pounding of the three or four chords that make up each song.</p>\n<p>This is an easygoing album full of memorable, hummable, sing-alongable\nsongs. It spawned a couple of the year’s stickiest tracks as far as my inner\near was concerned, with ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ not the only song from the\ncollection that continued spinning ad infinitum in my mind. (PS The roller-skating video to that song is also a lot of fun.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-ryo-fukui--mellow-dream\">10. Ryo Fukui — <em>Mellow Dream</em></h3>\n<p>I listened to a bit more jazz this year than has been the case the last couple,\nand whilst there have been a few records I’ve enjoyed (shouts to Takuya\nKuroda’s <em>Zigzagger</em> and Shabaka &amp; the Ancestors’ <em>Wisdom of Elders</em>) only\none really got its hooks into me in a serious must-play-every-other-day kind of\nway. <em>Mellow Dream</em> is aptly titled, and I never got tired of closing my eyes and\nrevisiting Fukui’s lively, colourful compositions. Some of the absolute best,\nmost energetic and surprising piano playing I’ve heard in years over the top of\na bass and percussion line that always knows just what’s required to keep\neach piece flowing. The title track / opener and follow-up ‘My Foolish Heart’\nare light and breezy, where ‘Baron Potato Blues’ has a bit more of a swagger,\nand the closing rendition of ‘My Funny Valentine’ is a little sad and demure. Throughout it’s impossible not to be impressed by Fukui’s playing, but taken holistically the\nalbum is an equally impressive achievement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-gold-panda--good-luck-and-do-your-best\">9. Gold Panda — <em>Good Luck and Do Your Best</em></h3>\n<p>The charming friendliness of this album’s title is carried over into its\nwelcoming ambience. Though occasionally employing some harder edges\n(such as on the haunting ‘Song for a Dead Friend’), the album’s overall vibe is\nof easygoing acceptance. Acoustic instruments layer upon drum patterns and\nsparingly-employed synth to make beautiful sculptures of sound like the\nmeditative and hypnotic ‘Time Eater’, and the resigned, good-natured\n‘Autumn Fall’. At the album’s centre is a track called ‘I Am Real Punk’ which\ndespite its title displays a kind of measured grace; its a microcosm of this self-\nassured, slightly odd collection of electronica.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-lone--levitate\">8. Lone — <em>Levitate</em></h3>\n<p>I find it difficult to believe now that Lone’s 2014 record <em>Reality Testing</em> didn&rsquo;t\nmake my top 20 for that year, but there you go: times change. Much like on\nthat record <em>Lone</em> has here put together a dazzling set of breakbeats over and\nthrough which he weaves hard-edged synth in deeply rhythmic patterns. Very\nfew tracks swung harder for me this year than ‘Backtail Was Heavy’, and it\nhas a couple of nice counterpoints here in the frenetic ‘Triple Helix’ and the\nslowly imploding ‘Sleepwalkers’. Levitate is a record that finds that sweet\nspot: at 34 minutes (good portions of which push the BPMs) it doesn’t outstay\nits welcome, but it also never runs out of ideas. As the closing moments of\n‘Hiraeth’ ebb away I almost always wanted to loop back to the start and take\nthe journey again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-holy-fuck--congrats\">7. Holy Fuck — <em>Congrats</em></h3>\n<p>Holy Fuck are one of those bands that I’ve been hearing about for years, and\nhave never taken the time to get to know. When I finally saw too many\nrecommendations for <em>Congrats</em> to ignore, and tuned in, I was immediately\nglad that I did. For one thing — speaking a bit reductively — in a year with no\nLiars LP and no Battles LP this helped fill a requirement for a particular type\nof over-energised, spiralling, de-tuned noise. Taken on its own merits though\n(as it should be) <em>Congrats</em> is raucous, sonically all-encompassing, and\nendlessly inventive: it keeps you off balance throughout in the same way the\nbetter Mars Volta records do. Album high point ‘House of Glass’ takes turns at\nbeing punishing, then jaunty, then punishing again as it unleashes a central\nbass-heavy refrain that sounds like a heart attack. There are certainly subtler\nmoments, such as on the interlude ‘Shimmering’ and the rather poppier ‘Neon\nDad’, but this isn’t pretending to be a pop album. It’s an odd thing, which\nchallenges you to wrestle with it and in doing so dig out some hidden\ntreasures. It’s well worth the effort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-tegan--sara--love-you-to-death\">6. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Love You To Death</em></h3>\n<p>A new T&amp;S album will likely always remain a landmark release for me purely\non the strength of 2004’s near-flawless <em>So Jealous</em>. But it would be wrong to\nthink of the Quins as still riding the wake of one great album as they’ve\nconsistently found ways to experiment with their own sound in new and\nimpressive ways. <em>The Con</em> (2007) managed to find a way out of <em>So Jealous’s</em>\nshadow by virtue of being odder, exhibiting rougher textures and sharper\nangles; <em>Sainthood</em> in 2009 took a larger step towards synth-based\ncompositions, and <em>Heartthrob</em> doubled down on that in 2013. If anything I feel\nlike I was a little behind the curve on those last two records, feeling a little\ndisappointed by them in the first instance before being won over by their\ninfectious charms. I felt more prepared for <em>Love You To Death</em>, and sure\nenough I was on board from Music’s first plays of ‘Boyfriend’, ‘100x’ and\npersonal favourite ‘Stop Desire’ that preceded the albums release. 32\nminutes, 10 tracks, not a bad one in sight (despite some occasionally\nquestionable half-rhyme lyrics here and there) and this record takes its place\namongst my top 5 Tegan &amp; Sara albums. It’s testament to their enduring\nexcellence that that is rare company to be in.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-explosions-in-the-sky--the-wilderness\">5. Explosions in the Sky — <em>The Wilderness</em></h3>\n<p>The short way to encapsulate how I feel about <em>The Wilderness</em> is to say that\nit’s EitS’s best LP since 2003’s <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em>, which\npretty much defined my personal understanding of post-rock. They’ve made\nvery good albums since, but this is the first to light up my synapses like the\nalbum that introduced me to them. Built largely of the same stuff as previous\nalbums — percussion that has the force of weather events, and great, snaking\nrivers of melody carving through canyon walls of guitar — this record also finds\nplaces to introduce some muted electronic elements; never in a way that\nradically alters the band’s now-signature sound, but certainly in ways that\ncomplement and tweak it in subtle ways, surely make long-term\nlisteners to EitS prick up their ears. My favourite of the record’s tracks is a\ntoss-up between the propulsive, evangelic currant of ‘Tangle Formations’, and\nthe darker, Basinski-referencing first single ‘Disintegration Anxiety’. Nothing\nhere is going to change anyone’s mind about the band (I wonder sometimes\nwhether their rapturous live show might have the power to do so), but it is a\nwelcome thing to find a band 17 years on from their formation still making\ncompelling music that is very much their own.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bloc-party--hymns\">4. Bloc Party — <em>Hymns</em></h3>\n<p>In some respects the most quietly revolutionary album of 2016. After a four\nyear break following <em>Intimacy</em> it didn’t feel like a sure thing that we’d see\nanother Bloc Party album. And even after the successes of <em>Four</em> (2012) the\nfour year break that followed that album had a ring of finality about it.\nIn some bands (even four-pieces) it would be no big thing to replace the\ndrummer and bassist; not so with Bloc Party, where Matt Tong and Gordon\nMoakes’s contributions were always beyond the average. Sure enough\n<em>Hymns</em> isn’t showcase to the same kind of frenetic, self-perpetuating drum\npatterns as previous of the band’s albums, and there are perhaps fewer truly\nmemorable bass lines. However, that is at least in part down to the way in\nwhich the band’s sound has reconfigured itself here. The tempos are often\nmore forgiving (certainly than was the case on <em>Four</em>), there is greater\nemphasis on Kele’s voice (with which he seems to feel increasingly\ncomfortable). What remains is songwriting split fairly evenly between\nconfessional and social commentary, and equally strong at each. But the\ntextures that are new to Bloc Party offer an opportunity to reach into new\nspaces: the unsettled oddness of ‘Different Drugs’; the romantic swell of ‘My\nTrue Name’ undercut by a haunting choral vocal; the proto-gospel euphoria of\n‘Only He Can Heal Me’, which takes its place amongst the band’s best tracks.\nI remain happy just to have this band around, I’m always excited to see what\nBloc Party do next, and for the first time I don’t really have a good idea what it\nmight sound like.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-elohim--elohim\">3. Elohim — <em>Elohim</em></h3>\n<p>Elohim was the discovery of 2016 for me, and several months on this record\nremains just as alluring and confounding as when I first ran across it. Opener\n‘Sensations’ is all you need in order to know whether this will be a record for\nyou; it hooked me after a single verse and chorus and hasn’t let go since.\nPoppier than Bat for Lashes and less angular than Grimes, this is still\ndefiantly odd alt-pop music and with a dark edge that’s reflected in the\nperformer’s penchant for wearing masks onstage and in her videos. (It’s\nworth mentioning that one of Elohim’s strongest tracks from 2016 —’Hallucinations’ —isn’t on this album, but was released on a subsequent EP\nand is also accompanied by perhaps my favourite (single-track) music video\nof the year.) ‘She Talks Too Much’ is winking and a little giddy; ‘Xanax’ is aptly\nwashed out and dreamlike, and feature’s one of 2016’s most memorable\nrefrains (“every day of my day of my day of my life”); ‘Guts’, though, squeaks\ninto the album-highlight spot by somehow channeling both Robyn and Jim\nGuthrie. Singular but all the more magnetic for it, I couldn’t get enough of this.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-rihanna--anti\">2. Rihanna — <em>ANTI</em></h3>\n<p>As I wrote above in relation to Beyoncé, despite a set of jewel-perfect singles\nI had not previously thought of Rihanna as an album artist. Like the rest of the\nworld then (if for different reasons), I wasn’t prepared for <em>ANTI</em>. Long in\ncoming though it has been, when the album finally arrived at the tail end of\nthe kind of wilfully obfuscatory social-media marketing campaign that is\nseemingly now de rigueur (see also <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, <em>Views</em>, <em>Lemonade</em>,\n<em>Blond(e)</em>) the reaction from music press and listening public alike was a near-\nuniversal: ‘wha?’. I lost track of the number of times people pointed out there\nwas no ‘Umbrella’ here, no ‘Take a Bow’ or ‘Only Girl’, as though a pop artist\nis expected to work to a quota of one banger per x number of other songs,\nwith which they can do what they like. On <em>ANTI</em> Rihanna is plainly not\ninterested in working to the one-for-me-one-for-the-dancefloor model. Instead\nshe’s happy to be flirtatious and demanding on ‘Work’, coy on ‘Kiss it Better’,\nand somewhat terrifying on ‘Needed Me’, all the while delivering flawless\nvocal performances (seriously, ‘Higher’ alone remains near-unbelievable after\n100+ listens) over the top of immaculate, captivating beats. If you need\nsomething else you can go listen to those Calvin Harris tracks that she makes\ninto pop masterpieces just by showing up. I’ll be here swaying to ‘Love on the\nBrain’ or crying to ‘Close to You’.\u2029</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-radiohead--a-moon-shaped-pool\">1. Radiohead — <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em></h3>\n<p>I honestly don’t know where to start when talking about Radiohead. Perhaps\nit’s enough to say that I’ve been on a quest for about 10 years to find anyone\nwho makes music that sounds anything like theirs, and I haven’t come up with\nanything. Radiohead, at this point, is a one-band genre, but one that shifts\nand re-colours itself to always remain stunningly relevant and new-seeming.\n<em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em> isn’t so much an album of music as it is the latest\ndispatch in the cataloguing of the British liberal psyche: this is who we are at\nthe moment, and how we feel, it seems to say. Still concerned about our\nlonelinesses and our failures, still preoccupied with finding a place in the\nworld, but also increasingly overwhelmed by larger events, and frightened by\nthe evanescence of hope.</p>\n<p>Arcade Fire do voice and hope, and are similarly documentarian; Liars do\ncomplex and dense layers of confused feeling; Sigur Ros do rapture;\nExplosions in the Sky do overwhelm and exorcism… only Radiohead\nconsistently find a way to put all of those components together, and always in\nbeautiful new ways that continue to awe me. We’re so very lucky to have\nthem.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Deftones — *Gore*\n\nDeftones topped 2012’s List with *Koi No Yokan* after a stretch of three albums in ten years that\ndidn't live up to the promise of 2000’s career-defining *White Pony*. Four years\nlater I’m happy to find *Gore* again hitting all of the right notes and innovating a\nlittle further sonically to keep them where they belong (as pretty much the\nonly heavy rock act I pay attention to any more). *Gore* is the first album to be\nreleased since the death of original bassist Chi Cheng in 2013 (following the\ncar crash in 2008 that left him in a coma). As such it is necessarily coloured\n(particularly lyrically) by Chino Moreno dealing with the final loss of his friend\nand bandmate. As with much of Deftones’ previous work, there is an expert\nblending of darkness & anger with lighter, more emotionally nuanced\nelements that allow the band to access a lot of places that other acts in the\nsame space can't or don’t. There’s a finesse to their art, with Moreno’s voice\nstill setting the tone, and the instrumentation as adept as ever in supporting\nthe emotional direction(s) of the songs.\n\nFollowing Cheng’s death there has been talk of releasing the now legendary\n*Eros*, the album that was near-complete at the time of his accident. It would\nbe very interesting to know what a Deftones album recorded in 2008 would\nsound like were it released now. As it is, I’m just happy that the band are still\nmaking new music of this standard.\n\n###  19. Honeyblood — *Babes Never Die*\n\nAfter a swelling intro, the title track establishes quickly exactly what kind of\nrecord Honeyblood have made: post-bubblegum garage pop, and throughout\na dozen tracks it’s delivered here in excellent form. Album high-point ‘Ready\nfor the Magic’ has detuned bass, handclaps, and a chorus to die for or dance\nto (take your pick). There are a couple of down-tempo moments (such as the\nMelvins-meet-Breeders dirge of ‘Love is a Disease’), but the main vibe is a\nkind of slant coyness, showcased in various attitudes from the sweeping\n‘Gangs’ to the low thrum of ‘Walking at Midnight’. Honeyblood know how to\ncraft a bridge, and at 39 minutes they also know how to get in and get out\nhaving delivered a few body blows.\n\n###  18. Chance the Rapper — *Coloring Book*\n\nSpoilers: you’re not going to find Kanye West’s *The Life of Pablo* on this list. That\nrecord is overly long, very self-indulgent (as you might expect), occasionally\ntranscendently masterful, but often frustratingly pedestrian or confused. As\nevents surrounding its release may have hinted, and events since have\nconfirmed, Kanye isn’t in a great place right now, and personally I think that\ncontributed to *…Pablo* being a bit of a mess.\n\nChance’s *Coloring Book* is the record I wish Kanye still feels he could make.\nIt’s the record that *Late Registration*-era Kanye could have put together in two\nweeks, but its relaxed attitude, sunny vibes, and good humour now seem\n(temporarily at least) beyond Chicago’s first son of rap; that baton has been\npassed, and Chance is running with it. Perhaps ironically it picks up precisely\nwhere Chance’s contribution to Kanye’s best track of 2016 — ‘Ultralight\nBeam’ — left off, and from there it soars through bouncy floor-fillers and\nrelaxed summer jams, rarely pausing to take a breath. With ‘Blessings’\nChance has fashioned perhaps what amounts to a sonic calling card: humble,\nnot overworked, relaxed, and fairly glowing right out the speakers.\n\n###  17. Thao & The Get Down Stay Down — *A Man Alive*\n\n30 seconds or so into album opener ‘Astonished Man’ one thinks ‘this sounds\nkinda like tUnE-yArDs’, and one is not wrong: produced by Merrill Garbus,\nthis set of quirky dark-pop belays her ear for space and gain, for fuzz and\nweird editing choices and for simple, driving percussion that holds down\nsomething otherwise less grounded. (‘Astonished Man’ was also the subject\nof an excellent [episode of Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/thao) this year, which reveals the song’s\ndeeply-personal roots.) Thao’s voice is an instrument perfectly-suited to\nswitching from conversational to plaintive to innocent and sing-songy. It’s in\nparticularly good form somersaulting all over the Pixies-ish ‘The Evening’,\nwhich just about loses out on album-highlight honours in favour of the catchy\nmoodswing of ‘Nobody Dies’, which is possessed of the kind of chorus you’ll\nsing the first time, hum for days, and then just bellow out the next time you\nhear it. Every part of the band gets a moment to shine on *A Man Alive*, but I\nfound that my favourite moments were often the Regina Spektor-esque\nconfessional moments, such as on ‘Guts’ (the second-best song with that title\nin 2016). Come for the pop, stay for the barrage of interesting ideas and left-\nof-centre hooks.\u2029\n\n###  16. Beyonce — *Lemonade*\n\nTo this point Beyonce hasn’t been an album artist for me. There have been a\nhandful of singles through the years that have lit up my radar and caught in\nmy mind, but it hasn’t been enough to convince me to spend an hour with her\nmusic. The 65 minute music video that accompanied the release of\n*Lemonade* was more than enough to change my mind: beautiful, inventive,\nand extraordinarily accomplished, the first watch of that film remains one of\nmy cultural high-points of 2016. It also serves as an excellent showcase of\nwhat a diverse collection of music is to be found on the album itself. Hip-hop,\nR&B, soul-flavours, a little country on ‘Daddy Lessons’, a pure-bred ballad\nlike ‘Sandcastles’, whatever garage rock-vibed thing Jack White’s helping bring\nforth on ‘Don’t Hurt Yourself’... there’s a lot here. And it’s all delivered with\nenergy to spare and immaculately produced. There’s also the much-\npublicised matter of the album’s central subject: her husband’s infidelity. It’s a\ntheme that provides the emotional fuel for all of the music here, and keeps\nit feeling honest, and it’s also the joining thread that runs through what\notherwise may have felt like a disparate collection of tracks. It should also be\nnoted that ‘Freedom’ is top 5 songs of the year material, and felt increasingly\nprophetic and necessary as 2016 wore on.\n\n###  15. Olafur Arnalds & Nils Frahm — *Trance Frendz*\n\nArnalds’s solo record *...And They Have Escaped\nthe Weight of Darkness* places 12th on my List in 2010, and represents both my serious\nintroduction to his work and the reason I’ve followed him since. Nils Frahm\ntook a deserved 12th spot with *Solo* last year (a record given some new life\nthis year by the release of a kind of director’s cut edition: *Solo Remains*).\nTheir working together is the kind of partnership that seems so inevitable that\nit must surely have been a case of when as opposed to whether. Pleasingly,\nthe fruits of the partnership, whilst familiar-sounding, are different enough that\nthey seem unlikely to have ever emerged from one or other of the artists\nalone. Spare and delicate in composition as they both are they have taken\nobvious care not to do too much here, and to facilitate one another where it\nwould have been easy for toes to be trodden upon. An ill-fitting title (it would\nhave been incredible if they’d made a trance record though), inscrutable track\nnames, and an album cover that looks like something they decided wasn’t\nquite interesting enough to go on Instagram, is all par for the course, and all\nmeaningless once ‘20:17’ begins and you can forget everything else in the\nworld for three-quarters of an hour. Beautiful stuff.\n\n###  14. Flume — *Skin*\n\nThe last few years I’ve seemingly latched on to at least one album of bright,\nwarm electronica that stays on heavy rotation for months. Fort Romeau’s\n*Insides* played the role last year, and it was SBTRKT’s sublime *Wonder\nWhere We'll Land* in 2014; this year the task falls to *Flume*. Similarly to that\nSBTRKT record this is a set of songs that benefit from a host of guest\nvocalists lending distinct flavours to a number of tracks throughout, but it’s all\nunderpinned with the a softly undulating blanket of pastel-coloured warmth\nthat ebbs and flows to its own hypnotising rhythm. Album-opener ‘Helix’\ncrests with a minute to go, and sets the relaxed tempo, then picked up by\nhighlight track ‘Never Be Like You’. Raekwon makes a notable appearance,\nand the record closes on a mellow high with Beck lending vocals to ‘Tiny\nCities’, but what kept this playing for me was the soundscape that Flume\nconjures throughout.\n\n###  13. Submerse — *Awake*\n\nSubmerse took 5th spot in 2014 with the wonderful *Slow Waves*, and whilst I\nenjoyed the follow-up (2015’s *Stay Home*) it just missed out on last year’s list.\n*Awake* finds Submerse back on The List and further securing his place as\none of my desert island artists. Ethereal opener 'Too Late, They’re Already\nHere’ is transportive, and gives way to perhaps my favourite Submerse track,\n‘Sidequests’: a shimmering pool of muted pops, shining chimes, and a mellow\nsynth are met by a minimal refrain in a climbing register. Like many of his\ntracks, it blends the electronic and the acoustic seamlessly into something\nunique-feeling and oddly alive. I listened to this set of tracks dozens of times\nthis year and found new things on each play through. At this point it would be\na shock if the next Submerse release sounded dramatically different to this,\nsince his recent output is all quite similar, but I’m excited for it regardless.\nThis is a sonic space I'll happily return to time and time again.\n\n###  12. Solange — *A Seat at the Table*\n\nHere’s something I’ve struggled with a bit this year: a prevailing sense that\nsome of the music I got the most enjoyment from is not intended for me.\nWhilst sensitive to cultural heritage I’m not a believer that such broad\ndistinctions as ‘white music’ and ‘black music’ exist; I don’t subscribe to the\nreductive idea that entire genres of music are the province of one set of\npeople or another. However, when an album like *A Seat at the Table* comes\nalong, and speaks in large part about the black experience, there’s a reflexive\nguilt and fear of cultural appropriation that rises in me at claiming it as one of\nmy favourite albums of the year. Oddly, this isn’t something that seems to\ntranslate to other media: I have no problem saying that Ta-Nehisi Coates’s\n*Between the World and Me* was one of the very best books I read this year, or\nthat *The Get Down* and *Atlanta* were two of my favourite TV shows of 2016 -\nall exemplary pieces of art that deal directly, primarily with black cultural\nhistory. Still, in the final analysis it would be disingenuous of me to leave\nSolange off this list. *A Seat at the Table* is a collection of beautifully crafted,\nsoul-infused R&B songs that mix the deeply personal with insightful social\ncommentary like few records I’ve heard the last couple of years. It is bold and\nvital, and despite all the ways in which it’s not for me it gave me too much not\nto recognise the important role it played in my listening in 2016.\n\n###  11. Angel Olsen — *MY WOMAN*\n\nWhat drew me to the (obligatorily fully capped-up) MY WOMAN in the first\nplace was catching the track ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ being played on Beats1. Had\nthe album been a wash that still would have been fine, since that one track — with it’s endearing mix of bokeh warmth and aching longing — ended up being\nprobably my favourite song of 2016. Fortunately there are plenty of other\ntreats in store on an album that puts garage pop-rock through its paces,\nwhilst bending it to all of its intended purposes: exciting, yearning,\ncommiserating, celebrating, and the painting of personal stories of loss and\nmisunderstanding in love. Olsen’s voice is the right balance between\nemotionally affected and lackadaisical, and her guitar is usually found in a\nsimilar (Ben Kweller-esque) attitude, moving between relaxed strum and\nenergised pounding of the three or four chords that make up each song.\n\nThis is an easygoing album full of memorable, hummable, sing-alongable\nsongs. It spawned a couple of the year’s stickiest tracks as far as my inner\near was concerned, with ‘Shut Up Kiss Me’ not the only song from the\ncollection that continued spinning ad infinitum in my mind. (PS The roller-skating video to that song is also a lot of fun.)\n\n###  10. Ryo Fukui — *Mellow Dream*\n\nI listened to a bit more jazz this year than has been the case the last couple,\nand whilst there have been a few records I’ve enjoyed (shouts to Takuya\nKuroda’s *Zigzagger* and Shabaka & the Ancestors’ *Wisdom of Elders*) only\none really got its hooks into me in a serious must-play-every-other-day kind of\nway. *Mellow Dream* is aptly titled, and I never got tired of closing my eyes and\nrevisiting Fukui’s lively, colourful compositions. Some of the absolute best,\nmost energetic and surprising piano playing I’ve heard in years over the top of\na bass and percussion line that always knows just what’s required to keep\neach piece flowing. The title track / opener and follow-up ‘My Foolish Heart’\nare light and breezy, where ‘Baron Potato Blues’ has a bit more of a swagger,\nand the closing rendition of ‘My Funny Valentine’ is a little sad and demure. Throughout it’s impossible not to be impressed by Fukui’s playing, but taken holistically the\nalbum is an equally impressive achievement.\n\n###  9. Gold Panda — *Good Luck and Do Your Best*\n\nThe charming friendliness of this album’s title is carried over into its\nwelcoming ambience. Though occasionally employing some harder edges\n(such as on the haunting ‘Song for a Dead Friend’), the album’s overall vibe is\nof easygoing acceptance. Acoustic instruments layer upon drum patterns and\nsparingly-employed synth to make beautiful sculptures of sound like the\nmeditative and hypnotic ‘Time Eater’, and the resigned, good-natured\n‘Autumn Fall’. At the album’s centre is a track called ‘I Am Real Punk’ which\ndespite its title displays a kind of measured grace; its a microcosm of this self-\nassured, slightly odd collection of electronica.\n\n###  8. Lone — *Levitate*\n\nI find it difficult to believe now that Lone’s 2014 record *Reality Testing* didn't\nmake my top 20 for that year, but there you go: times change. Much like on\nthat record *Lone* has here put together a dazzling set of breakbeats over and\nthrough which he weaves hard-edged synth in deeply rhythmic patterns. Very\nfew tracks swung harder for me this year than ‘Backtail Was Heavy’, and it\nhas a couple of nice counterpoints here in the frenetic ‘Triple Helix’ and the\nslowly imploding ‘Sleepwalkers’. Levitate is a record that finds that sweet\nspot: at 34 minutes (good portions of which push the BPMs) it doesn’t outstay\nits welcome, but it also never runs out of ideas. As the closing moments of\n‘Hiraeth’ ebb away I almost always wanted to loop back to the start and take\nthe journey again.\n\n###  7. Holy Fuck — *Congrats*\n\nHoly Fuck are one of those bands that I’ve been hearing about for years, and\nhave never taken the time to get to know. When I finally saw too many\nrecommendations for *Congrats* to ignore, and tuned in, I was immediately\nglad that I did. For one thing — speaking a bit reductively — in a year with no\nLiars LP and no Battles LP this helped fill a requirement for a particular type\nof over-energised, spiralling, de-tuned noise. Taken on its own merits though\n(as it should be) *Congrats* is raucous, sonically all-encompassing, and\nendlessly inventive: it keeps you off balance throughout in the same way the\nbetter Mars Volta records do. Album high point ‘House of Glass’ takes turns at\nbeing punishing, then jaunty, then punishing again as it unleashes a central\nbass-heavy refrain that sounds like a heart attack. There are certainly subtler\nmoments, such as on the interlude ‘Shimmering’ and the rather poppier ‘Neon\nDad’, but this isn’t pretending to be a pop album. It’s an odd thing, which\nchallenges you to wrestle with it and in doing so dig out some hidden\ntreasures. It’s well worth the effort.\n\n###  6. Tegan & Sara — *Love You To Death*\n\nA new T&S album will likely always remain a landmark release for me purely\non the strength of 2004’s near-flawless *So Jealous*. But it would be wrong to\nthink of the Quins as still riding the wake of one great album as they’ve\nconsistently found ways to experiment with their own sound in new and\nimpressive ways. *The Con* (2007) managed to find a way out of *So Jealous’s*\nshadow by virtue of being odder, exhibiting rougher textures and sharper\nangles; *Sainthood* in 2009 took a larger step towards synth-based\ncompositions, and *Heartthrob* doubled down on that in 2013. If anything I feel\nlike I was a little behind the curve on those last two records, feeling a little\ndisappointed by them in the first instance before being won over by their\ninfectious charms. I felt more prepared for *Love You To Death*, and sure\nenough I was on board from Music’s first plays of ‘Boyfriend’, ‘100x’ and\npersonal favourite ‘Stop Desire’ that preceded the albums release. 32\nminutes, 10 tracks, not a bad one in sight (despite some occasionally\nquestionable half-rhyme lyrics here and there) and this record takes its place\namongst my top 5 Tegan & Sara albums. It’s testament to their enduring\nexcellence that that is rare company to be in.\u2029\n\n###  5. Explosions in the Sky — *The Wilderness*\n\nThe short way to encapsulate how I feel about *The Wilderness* is to say that\nit’s EitS’s best LP since 2003’s *The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place*, which\npretty much defined my personal understanding of post-rock. They’ve made\nvery good albums since, but this is the first to light up my synapses like the\nalbum that introduced me to them. Built largely of the same stuff as previous\nalbums — percussion that has the force of weather events, and great, snaking\nrivers of melody carving through canyon walls of guitar — this record also finds\nplaces to introduce some muted electronic elements; never in a way that\nradically alters the band’s now-signature sound, but certainly in ways that\ncomplement and tweak it in subtle ways, surely make long-term\nlisteners to EitS prick up their ears. My favourite of the record’s tracks is a\ntoss-up between the propulsive, evangelic currant of ‘Tangle Formations’, and\nthe darker, Basinski-referencing first single ‘Disintegration Anxiety’. Nothing\nhere is going to change anyone’s mind about the band (I wonder sometimes\nwhether their rapturous live show might have the power to do so), but it is a\nwelcome thing to find a band 17 years on from their formation still making\ncompelling music that is very much their own.\u2029\n\n### 4. Bloc Party — *Hymns*\n\nIn some respects the most quietly revolutionary album of 2016. After a four\nyear break following *Intimacy* it didn’t feel like a sure thing that we’d see\nanother Bloc Party album. And even after the successes of *Four* (2012) the\nfour year break that followed that album had a ring of finality about it.\nIn some bands (even four-pieces) it would be no big thing to replace the\ndrummer and bassist; not so with Bloc Party, where Matt Tong and Gordon\nMoakes’s contributions were always beyond the average. Sure enough\n*Hymns* isn’t showcase to the same kind of frenetic, self-perpetuating drum\npatterns as previous of the band’s albums, and there are perhaps fewer truly\nmemorable bass lines. However, that is at least in part down to the way in\nwhich the band’s sound has reconfigured itself here. The tempos are often\nmore forgiving (certainly than was the case on *Four*), there is greater\nemphasis on Kele’s voice (with which he seems to feel increasingly\ncomfortable). What remains is songwriting split fairly evenly between\nconfessional and social commentary, and equally strong at each. But the\ntextures that are new to Bloc Party offer an opportunity to reach into new\nspaces: the unsettled oddness of ‘Different Drugs’; the romantic swell of ‘My\nTrue Name’ undercut by a haunting choral vocal; the proto-gospel euphoria of\n‘Only He Can Heal Me’, which takes its place amongst the band’s best tracks.\nI remain happy just to have this band around, I’m always excited to see what\nBloc Party do next, and for the first time I don’t really have a good idea what it\nmight sound like.\u2029\n\n###  3. Elohim — *Elohim*\n\nElohim was the discovery of 2016 for me, and several months on this record\nremains just as alluring and confounding as when I first ran across it. Opener\n‘Sensations’ is all you need in order to know whether this will be a record for\nyou; it hooked me after a single verse and chorus and hasn’t let go since.\nPoppier than Bat for Lashes and less angular than Grimes, this is still\ndefiantly odd alt-pop music and with a dark edge that’s reflected in the\nperformer’s penchant for wearing masks onstage and in her videos. (It’s\nworth mentioning that one of Elohim’s strongest tracks from 2016 —’Hallucinations’ —isn’t on this album, but was released on a subsequent EP\nand is also accompanied by perhaps my favourite (single-track) music video\nof the year.) ‘She Talks Too Much’ is winking and a little giddy; ‘Xanax’ is aptly\nwashed out and dreamlike, and feature’s one of 2016’s most memorable\nrefrains (“every day of my day of my day of my life”); ‘Guts’, though, squeaks\ninto the album-highlight spot by somehow channeling both Robyn and Jim\nGuthrie. Singular but all the more magnetic for it, I couldn’t get enough of this.\u2029\n\n###  2. Rihanna — *ANTI*\n\nAs I wrote above in relation to Beyoncé, despite a set of jewel-perfect singles\nI had not previously thought of Rihanna as an album artist. Like the rest of the\nworld then (if for different reasons), I wasn’t prepared for *ANTI*. Long in\ncoming though it has been, when the album finally arrived at the tail end of\nthe kind of wilfully obfuscatory social-media marketing campaign that is\nseemingly now de rigueur (see also *The Life of Pablo*, *Views*, *Lemonade*,\n*Blond(e)*) the reaction from music press and listening public alike was a near-\nuniversal: ‘wha?’. I lost track of the number of times people pointed out there\nwas no ‘Umbrella’ here, no ‘Take a Bow’ or ‘Only Girl’, as though a pop artist\nis expected to work to a quota of one banger per x number of other songs,\nwith which they can do what they like. On *ANTI* Rihanna is plainly not\ninterested in working to the one-for-me-one-for-the-dancefloor model. Instead\nshe’s happy to be flirtatious and demanding on ‘Work’, coy on ‘Kiss it Better’,\nand somewhat terrifying on ‘Needed Me’, all the while delivering flawless\nvocal performances (seriously, ‘Higher’ alone remains near-unbelievable after\n100+ listens) over the top of immaculate, captivating beats. If you need\nsomething else you can go listen to those Calvin Harris tracks that she makes\ninto pop masterpieces just by showing up. I’ll be here swaying to ‘Love on the\nBrain’ or crying to ‘Close to You’.\u2029\n\n###  1. Radiohead — *A Moon Shaped Pool*\n\nI honestly don’t know where to start when talking about Radiohead. Perhaps\nit’s enough to say that I’ve been on a quest for about 10 years to find anyone\nwho makes music that sounds anything like theirs, and I haven’t come up with\nanything. Radiohead, at this point, is a one-band genre, but one that shifts\nand re-colours itself to always remain stunningly relevant and new-seeming.\n*A Moon Shaped Pool* isn’t so much an album of music as it is the latest\ndispatch in the cataloguing of the British liberal psyche: this is who we are at\nthe moment, and how we feel, it seems to say. Still concerned about our\nlonelinesses and our failures, still preoccupied with finding a place in the\nworld, but also increasingly overwhelmed by larger events, and frightened by\nthe evanescence of hope.\n\nArcade Fire do voice and hope, and are similarly documentarian; Liars do\ncomplex and dense layers of confused feeling; Sigur Ros do rapture;\nExplosions in the Sky do overwhelm and exorcism… only Radiohead\nconsistently find a way to put all of those components together, and always in\nbeautiful new ways that continue to awe me. We’re so very lucky to have\nthem.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Michael Ondaatje’s novel <em>In The Skin of a Lion</em> (1987) is full of exquisite detail, used in bringing to life some beautifully crafted characters and extraordinary events. It’s a book that moves from a brilliantly rendered Canadian river to a palatial waterworks plant via a stolen yacht, a mushroom factory, a prison and a house aflame. Ondaatje’s command of language is absolute; no matter how unlikely the situation he does not fall into cartoonishness, and even though some of his more colourful characters risk caricature, he expertly keeps them from crossing that line. And yet for all this, the one sentence of the novel that caught me most off guard is simple and declarative, possessed of some less ornate form of the magic the author uses elsewhere.

The staccato triplet of ‘gave him his’ after the natural pause propels the reader towards the end of the sentence and that second elongated vowel sound.\n\nIt’s wonderful, poetic writing: a simple, finely crafted piece of description that has emotional colour to it and is rhythmically pleasing to the reader’s mind.\n\n[^1]: The sentence in question is on page 128 of the 1988 Picador edition.\n",

				"title": "The List 2015",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-the-necks--vertigo\">20. The Necks — <em>Vertigo</em></h3>\n<p>Kicked off in 2006 when I fell hard for <em>Chemist</em>, and continuing through a dalliance with the peerless <em>Silverwater</em> (2009) as well as an <a href=\"/neckslive\">unforgettable Barbican live performance</a>, my love affair with The Necks continues. There have been a few releases in between, but the 44 minutes of <em>Vertigo’s</em> single track have been the first to stick firmly in my mind and find me consistently playing a Necks release in a little while.</p>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the band’s sound this is exactly what you’d expect, and if you’re not it’s very difficult to describe. The tags you’d apply to it—’improvised’ &amp; ‘jazz’ chief amongst them—are useful to a point, but not necessarily indicative of just how successfully this trio create a singular-feeling music: unrepeatable and yet entirely consistent in terms of the levels of interest and intrigue it sustains. All of which makes it even less palatable that I was in London on the final night of their Café Oto residency and did not manage to secure a ticket!</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-battles--la-di-da-di\">19. Battles — <em>La Di Da Di</em></h3>\n<p>When the new Battles line-up dropped <em>Dross Glop</em> in 2012, five years on and one member down from the glorious debut <em>Mirrored</em> (2007) I was super-excited, and then — once the sugar rush had abated — a little disappointed with the result. The album had its moments, but the loss of Tyondai Braxton was notable (indeed, in retrospect, Braxton’s solo album <em>Central Market</em> (2009) was the stronger post-<em>Mirrored</em> output). It’s gratifying then to find Battles, a couple of years into the new lineup, genuinely returned to their full strength. Opener here ‘The Yabba’ (the track titles make as little sense as ever) is as strong as anything on the debut; both ‘Dot Net’ and ‘FF Bada’ repurpose drum patterns familiar from that first record but find new and inventive ways to use them - woven in with an instrumental palate that has the strange honour of now feeling totally familiar as well as distinctly off-kilter.</p>\n<p>There’s certainly the odd moment when you wonder whether a line has been crossed (such as on the impenetrable opening minute of &lsquo;Tricentennial’) but those can be waived in light of how good it is to hear this band back to their endlessly inventive best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-florence--the-machine--how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful\">18. Florence + The Machine — <em>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</em></h3>\n<p>I haven’t paid all that much attention to Florence Welch since debut album <em>Lungs</em> arrived alongside debuts from Little Boots &amp; La Roux in 2009. It was ‘Bulletproof’ &amp; ‘In For The Kill’ from the latter that stuck with me that year, and then all three artists kind of faded from view for me.</p>\n<p>After an underwhelming return by La Roux last year, it comes as a welcome surprise that F+TM’s record really got to me this time around. I read a review at the time that pointed out the symbolic importance of Welch’s facing forward on the album cover for the first time. And indeed this does feel like a more directly addressed, more personal set of songs. Less obtuse, adorned with less in the way of theatrics, the record embraces naked emotionality as its throughline. There are certainly poetic flourishes to the lyrics, and the album isn’t without bombast (‘Queen of Peace’ rises and blooms like a firework display), but it feels somehow more personal than both the artist’s previous output and that of the majority of her contemporaries.</p>\n<p>It should be mentioned also, that the 4-minute white rapids journey of opener ‘Ship to Wreck’ is quite possibly the best song I heard all year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-squarepusher--damogen-furies\">17. Squarepusher — <em>Damogen Furies</em></h3>\n<p>Over a 20+ year career I’ve payed far too little attention to Squarepusher. The closest I got previously was a dip into 2010’s Shobaleader One: <em>d’Demonstrator</em> - itself a kind of spin-off album featuring an expanded lineup. <em>Damogen Furies</em> is my first exposure to Squarepusher-prime, and it’s left me a little shaken but thrilled and hungry for more. Comprising a host of somewhat raw-sounding electronica elements, settled in a bed of off-kilter, low wind instruments, or 16-bit era videogame chiptune soundscapes, the overall tone of the album is somewhere between menacing and schizophrenic — not dissimilar to Reznor’s OST for <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em>.</p>\n<p>At its most frenetic the drum patterning walks a line between highly measured and almost-freeform jazz, ricocheting all over the map and pulling the melodies into any number of new, convoluted forms. (One of my favourite examples of this is once ‘Baltang Ort’ gets past the 4.30 mark and loses its composure a bit; that last minute is insane.) It’s a remarkable achievement to make something so mechanical seem at the same time organic - responsive to shifts in the music’s mood.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-will-butler--policy\">16. Will Butler — <em>Policy</em></h3>\n<p>Will Butler, here, has the same thing going for him as going against him: his membership of Arcade Fire. It’s doubtful — or at least significantly less likely — that I would have picked up this record without that background, and yet it comes freighted with a baggage that is entirely unfair. What Butler has produced is nothing more and nothing less than a collection of simple songs. Each one has an emotional directness familiar to listeners of his previous works, and they move between valences with aplomb. ‘Finish What I Started’ is a two-minute plea from the heart, and then it’s straight into ‘Son of God’: something close to an understated call for revolution.</p>\n<p>There’s a smattering of multi-instrumentalism, but it sounds more like one man jumping from piano to keyboard to guitar, and less like the glorious, polychromatic racket that the collective of which he’s an integral part are capable of building. There’s also the nagging fact of how close Will’s voice is to that of brother Win. In a year without an Arcade Fire album this was a welcome dose of some watered-down substitute. That’s a very unfair thing to say about a pretty great album of alt-pop songs, but it was the feeling I couldn’t shake on the many occasions I listened to it. Sorry Will.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-wolf-alice--my-love-is-cool\">15. Wolf Alice — <em>My Love is Cool</em></h3>\n<p>The list of bands I listened to religiously in the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s that are obvious influences on Wolf Alice is long. And there’s no effort made to disguise that here, on an album that feels both a little familiar and oddly quaint in its delivery of a 20+ year old sound. Opener ‘Turn to Dust’ is as pretty as it is alluring, with just a hint of sadness enough to make you wonder what other colours the band will paint with. It’s the sort of effortless conjuring of mood that Laura Marling displayed time and again on her first couple of albums. When, after just over 3 minutes, the album shifts into ‘Bros’, the listener is assured that they’re in safe hands; I certainly didn’t hear a prettier straight-ahead, guitar-led pop song this year - so simple in its construction, yet executed beautifully enough to bring a tear to my eye on several listens.</p>\n<p>I’m left with questions about what the future holds for Wolf Alice: another collection of easygoing pop-rock singalongs that risks diminishing returns, or the temptation to risk something that may be outside their comfort zone? For now though, we have a really solid debut that does one thing very well indeed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-fort-romeau--insides\">14. Fort Romeau — <em>Insides</em></h3>\n<p>I’d made the decision before the start of the year to listen to every 2015 release that Ghostly International put out, so – even if this hadn’t come recommended by Kieran Hebden — I would have run across it eventually.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why the man behind Four Tet likes what fellow Brit Mike Greene is doing here: it occupies largely the same space as Hebden’s own <em>Rounds</em> (2003): a kind of warm, comfortable, trancelike feeling somewhere between early morning tiredness and lazy sunbeam comfort. There are denser moments, such as the bass-driven ‘All I Want’, but they are swells upon an otherwise even-tempered expanse of musical ocean.</p>\n<p>(This ended up being my favourite eligible Ghostly release for the year, though Shigeto’s <em>Intermission</em> EP, would be way up there if it was a little longer than 6 tracks &amp; ~20 minutes.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-ibeyi--ibeyi\">13. Ibeyi — <em>Ibeyi</em></h3>\n<p>The two voices at the heart of Ibeyi’s self-titled debut are almost indistinguishable, belonging as they do to twins: Naomi &amp; Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Both are light, playful, and soulful, painting flowing lines over beds of minimal piano and simple beats. At times they’re also haunting, used to great effect in mirroring or weaving in and out of each other, such as on album highlight ‘River’ where they hold a kind of conversation amid the waves of their own background harmonising.</p>\n<p>It no doubt helps that I first heard this record when we were in Copenhagen in February, and it’s linked in my mind with a great week we spent out there. The album’s sonic warmth conjures for me, every time, the warmth of the apartment we were staying in, and to which we returned after days walking in biting cold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-nils-frahm--solo\">12. Nils Frahm — <em>Solo</em></h3>\n<p>In much the same way that Ghostly International started to colonise great swathes of my listening time a couple of years ago, London-based label Erased Tapes have made a huge impact for me recently: I got a lot of listening out of Kiasmos’s self-titled LP last year; A Winged Victory for the Sullen provided me with an unforgettable live experience in a Danish church this February&hellip; and there’s another ET artist elsewhere on this list. Hence it’s fitting that I came to Frahm via labelmate Ólafur Arnalds, a kindred spirit and sometime collaborator (they put out an EP together this year actually, which — though ineligible for The List — is a recommended listen also).</p>\n<p>In terms of the album itself — a collection of masterfully constructed piano pieces —there’s not too much to say. There is some variation: the slightness of ‘Chant’ and the swell of ‘Wall’, but the album is best considered of a piece, and the mood it evokes is singular. The <em>Pitchfork</em> review phrased it this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;[I]t’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me, it was, easily. On several occasions this year it was precisely the record I needed, and to which I turned when nothing else would do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-the-sidekicks--runners-in-the-nerved-world\">11. The Sidekicks — <em>Runners in the Nerved World</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not sure how I came to listen to this; a January release that has stuck around tenaciously to claim a spot on The List, and has done so by charm more than anything else. Touchstones here are bands like The Shins and Saves the Day, and this record firmly filled the same spot this year as Local Natives’ <em>Hummingbird</em> a couple of years ago: the best example that happened to cross into my awareness of a musical style far more prevalent on these lists in the early 2000s and appearing with increasing rarity since. Nevertheless this is the real thing and faithfully delivered. Steve Ciolek’s voice is an empathetic through-line with a range between falsetto fragility and convincing moments of emotional conviction.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Blissfield, MI’ is the record’s high point, though its driving bravado is something of an outlier on an album primarily comprising prettier pop-rock. The track also contains the album’s best lyric; the kind of glimpse into personal emotional-geography that late ‘90s / early ’00s emo at its best did so well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel like how the Bulls felt in 1993<br>\nI feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"10-shamir--ratchet\">10. Shamir — <em>Ratchet</em></h3>\n<p>Another debut album for The List, and another distinct vocal - Shamir Bailey’s performance is by turns fragile (in the manner of a Michael Jackson ballad), cocky, or occasionally fierce. Low-key opener ‘Vegas’ keys the listener into a couple of the record’s themes — sin, pleasure — but is quickly undercut in a piece of genius sequencing by ‘Make A Scene’: a none-more-pop chant littered with unidentifiable sound effects, something that sounds distinctly like cow-bell, and a vaulting laser effect that draws the listener’s ear up and over Bailey’s falsetto.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of catchy — if insubstantial — pleasures on offer, but the best track on the album is inarguably ‘On The Regular’, also probably 2015’s most infectious song. Its blend of lightness, self-assurance, and touches of thematic darkness are a good microcosm of the album in general. In the final analysis though, it was Shamir’s ear for a hook and the wit of his lyrics that brought me back to this time and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-purity-ring--another-eternity\">9. Purity Ring — <em>Another Eternity</em></h3>\n<p>For whatever reason Purity Ring’s debut (<em>Shrines</em> (2012)) didn’t make it onto my radar, and my introduction to the band came when I asked Siri to identify a song which turned out to be ‘Bodyache’ in a coffee shop this summer. Not long after that I was hooked on an album delicately balancing bright, dense synths and a similarly-toned female vocal. There are a few rhythm &amp; blues touches here and there (the cadence of ‘Repetition’ for example), but it’s one influence among a spectrum, all blended here amongst warm synth-swaths to produce an album it’s easy to submerge yourself in and not want to emerge from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing even slightly revolutionary here, but it’s an album — like Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> (2012) and SBTRKT’s <em>Wonder Where We Land</em> (2014) — that builds a cohesive and vibrant world of sound that pulled me in and kept me entranced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-jamie-xx--in-colour\">8. Jamie xx — <em>In Colour</em></h3>\n<p>There’s something very smart about Jamie xx’s marking this solo release by calling out in the title (and album cover) the contrast to The xx’s predominantly monochrome aesthetic. That relationship is carried through to the music also, with the record feeling more expansive, more energetic, and wider-ranging than the (superb) work Jamie’s put out alongside Romy Madley Croft &amp; Oliver Sim. Touching on the same positive-vibes club scene sound as Four Tet’s recent output, the record moves at a pace and imparts a real warmth without ever moving much beyond third gear.</p>\n<p>Opener ‘Gosh’ is a cheeky statement of intent. ’Stranger in a Room’ is night-driving music; traffic-lights refracted through rain music - cool in tone and soporific. ‘Hold Tight’ is a helter-skelter, hypnotic headphone trip. ’Obvs’ even manages to make good use of one of my least-favourite instruments: the steel drum.</p>\n<p>I got a real kick out of this collection of assorted brighter, club-electronica sounds, and it’s left me even more excited for a third LP from The xx in 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-rival-consoles--howl\">7. Rival Consoles — <em>Howl</em></h3>\n<p>And here’s that other member of the Erased Tapes roster alluded to earlier. Ryan Lee West’s set of constantly shifting soundscapes put a spell on me this year. As with Squarepusher earlier in this list, this is electronic music engaged in the exploration of what happens when a pattern is disrupted, complicated, and altered. Not as fraught as the music on <em>Damogen Furies</em>, but just as restless, this is an album for headphones not just because of its density and intricacy, but also because of its propulsiveness. It’s music to walk to, run to, and ride rails to.</p>\n<p>Each track is distinct, none outstay their welcome, and West knows when he’s stretched a beat to its breaking point, and thus when to move on. There’s a melancholy to some of the album’s lower tones, but elsewhere there’s a playfulness, and energy to spare (such as displayed by the shuffling brush-played drums underneath album highlight ‘Low’). Closing track ‘Looming’ is perhaps the collection’s tightest package; the euphoric shivers of synth that run through it ringing out like harbingers of a sunrise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-nosaj-thing--fated\">6. Nosaj Thing — <em>Fated</em></h3>\n<p>There’s a tone and a tempo of electronica that I’ve been continuously hunting since Flying Lotus’s <em>Cosmogramma</em> put me under its spell in 2010. Shigeto’s <em>No Better Time Than Now</em> satisfied the itch in 2013, and last year the role was played by Submerse’s <em>Slow Waves</em>; in 2015 the honour goes to the third record by Jason Chung a.k.a. Nosaj Thing.</p>\n<p>Laid back to the point of near-horizontality, and characterised by nothing so much as a pervading sense of warmth, this is a species of electronic music that finds soul and humanity within the machines - blood in the wires. If I could pick a record of 2015 to live inside, it might well be <em>Fated</em>. The cover image is a simple black &amp; white photo of Chung holding up a fork by the tines, a butter knife suspended from it at 6 o’clock, pulled by gravity and held by some quirk of magnetism. The album somehow feels the same: a long, suspended moment, slightly magical, in tune with chance. For whatever reason I think of this sub-category as liminal electronica - and, considering that that’s a musical genre that doesn’t exist outside of my head, Chung does a remarkable job of getting it just right.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-metric--pagans-in-vegas\">5. Metric — <em>Pagans in Vegas</em></h3>\n<p>This album’s a disappointment within the limited framework of comparison to its predecessor: the flawless <em>Synthetica</em> (2012). Still present are the sure-footedly executed balance of pop sensibilities and underlying electro menace, the flawless understanding of what a key-change or lyrical twist can accomplish, and the sense of a band exploring every corner of their alt-electro-synth-pop palate.</p>\n<p>When the pace dipped I found myself losing interest just a little — something that never happened throughout <em>Synthetica</em> — and overall the quality is merely outstanding rather than genre-defining. There are exceptions: the effervescent ‘The Shade’, and the sly, shifting ’Cascades’ are every bit as good as I’d come to expect from Metric. In the final analysis this is a really solid continuation of the band’s sound, somewhat unfairly made to feel slight in comparison to a vastly superior previous album. And yet, these things must be put in context and this place in the top five is richly deserved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-toro-y-moi--what-for\">4. Toro y Moi — <em>What For?</em></h3>\n<p>This is an album possessed of both a distinct sense of the mood it wants to invoke, and also a sense of humour about the single-mindedness with which it sets about the task. Smart, effortlessly cool, and rendered with a fresh clarity, the soul influences are worn as a badge of honour whilst the mismatch of laid-back delivery and sometimes heavier content is endlessly compelling.</p>\n<p>The vocals are liberally treated with effects, but its done with such a holistic sense of the album’s sonic world that instead of risking distraction it instead echoes the warm distortion of the guitars, and serves to deepen the rich, swaying textures of the lower- tempo tracks. When the pace picks up on tracks like ‘Empty Nesters’ it takes the edge off the more cutting lyrics (“Call Mom &amp; Dad because their nest is empty, and so are you”) and keeps the mood light. Aaron Gold’s drums perform the same trick throughout, keeping things light and moving swiftly.</p>\n<p>The record’s finest moment comes in the shape of ‘Spell It Out’: a three-minute sideswipe that comes off like a simultaneous slap and kiss to the cheek.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-grimes--art-angels\">3. Grimes — <em>Art Angels</em></h3>\n<p>Rumour has it that after the unexpected level of attention garnered by 2012’s <em>Visions</em>, Clare Boucher made an album’s worth of material — including ill-conceived single release ’Go’ — before scrapping the whole thing and starting again. If true it’s perhaps indicative of how seriously Boucher sees the task of representing herself truthfully through her art in the glare of intensified media interest.</p>\n<p>She starts, simply, on the introductory ‘Laughing and Not Being Normal’, by reminding us that she has a spectacular voice, sometimes overlooked in commentary that focusses on her layering techniques and beat-making. From there she progresses into the achingly-beautiful ‘California’, which contains perhaps Grimes’s clearest method statement: &ldquo;I love this music / It sounds just like my soul&rdquo;. And so unfolds a record democratic in its tastes, eclectic in its tone and tempo, and yet singularly focussed on the task of pure artistic expression. Whatever reception the release received it seems clear that the most important thing to the artist here was making a record she was happy with.

Sleater-Kinney — <em>No Cities to Love</em></h3>\n<p>Where did this come from?</p>\n<p>I had a slight familiarity with S-K’s previous album: <em>The Woods</em> (2005), but that was a decade ago, and prior to that — in the pre-streaming / pre-download era — they’d never really crossed my radar other than as mentions in articles analysing the impact of grunge, listed alongside Belly and Sonic Youth, and a dozen other bands I never really connected with for whatever reason. So it comes as something of a surprise that I fell so hard for this album, having tuned in after hearing it compared to Wild Flag’s 2011 debut. (It’s pretty funny how clearly I had that influence the wrong way around.)\nReleased not three weeks into the year it was immediately obvious that this album would stick around for a place on The List. ‘Price Tag’ might be the best opening track of any album this year, and like ‘Surface Envy’, ‘A New Wave’ and&hellip; well, most of the album, it’s a ~3-minute masterpiece of concentrated energy driving forward a smart lyric. This collection of songs is near bursting at the seams with ideas, energy and new directionality; it’s possible that after 10 years away the three members of Sleater-Kinney came back together with so many ideas that <em>No Cities to Love</em> represents the finest 10 tracks of dozens recorded. Whatever the case, they’ve produced a near-perfect rock album with just the right levels of enthusiasm, menace, sadness, and empowering anger. The title track deserves special mention for balancing these elements particularly flawlessly, whilst showcasing the poppy lightness that keeps the whole record effervescing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-chvrches--every-open-eye\">1. Chvrches — <em>Every Open Eye</em></h3>\n<p>Chvrches’ debut album reached number 4 on my 2013 list and so it’s fitting that this record, which represents a simultaneous strengthening and deepening of their sound, claims a higher spot.

Lauren Mayberry’s voice remains the band’s secret weapon: sometimes fragile-seeming and bruised, it is uniquely suited to making anthemic vocals feel tender and personal.

				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. The Necks — *Vertigo*\n\nKicked off in 2006 when I fell hard for *Chemist*, and continuing through a dalliance with the peerless *Silverwater* (2009) as well as an [unforgettable Barbican live performance](/neckslive), my love affair with The Necks continues. There have been a few releases in between, but the 44 minutes of *Vertigo’s* single track have been the first to stick firmly in my mind and find me consistently playing a Necks release in a little while.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the band’s sound this is exactly what you’d expect, and if you’re not it’s very difficult to describe. The tags you’d apply to it—’improvised’ & ‘jazz’ chief amongst them—are useful to a point, but not necessarily indicative of just how successfully this trio create a singular-feeling music: unrepeatable and yet entirely consistent in terms of the levels of interest and intrigue it sustains. All of which makes it even less palatable that I was in London on the final night of their Café Oto residency and did not manage to secure a ticket!\n\n###  19. Battles — *La Di Da Di*\n\nWhen the new Battles line-up dropped *Dross Glop* in 2012, five years on and one member down from the glorious debut *Mirrored* (2007) I was super-excited, and then — once the sugar rush had abated — a little disappointed with the result. The album had its moments, but the loss of Tyondai Braxton was notable (indeed, in retrospect, Braxton’s solo album *Central Market* (2009) was the stronger post-*Mirrored* output). It’s gratifying then to find Battles, a couple of years into the new lineup, genuinely returned to their full strength. Opener here ‘The Yabba’ (the track titles make as little sense as ever) is as strong as anything on the debut; both ‘Dot Net’ and ‘FF Bada’ repurpose drum patterns familiar from that first record but find new and inventive ways to use them - woven in with an instrumental palate that has the strange honour of now feeling totally familiar as well as distinctly off-kilter.\n\nThere’s certainly the odd moment when you wonder whether a line has been crossed (such as on the impenetrable opening minute of 'Tricentennial’) but those can be waived in light of how good it is to hear this band back to their endlessly inventive best.\n\n###  18. Florence + The Machine — *How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful*\n\nI haven’t paid all that much attention to Florence Welch since debut album *Lungs* arrived alongside debuts from Little Boots & La Roux in 2009. It was ‘Bulletproof’ & ‘In For The Kill’ from the latter that stuck with me that year, and then all three artists kind of faded from view for me.\n\nAfter an underwhelming return by La Roux last year, it comes as a welcome surprise that F+TM’s record really got to me this time around. I read a review at the time that pointed out the symbolic importance of Welch’s facing forward on the album cover for the first time. And indeed this does feel like a more directly addressed, more personal set of songs. Less obtuse, adorned with less in the way of theatrics, the record embraces naked emotionality as its throughline. There are certainly poetic flourishes to the lyrics, and the album isn’t without bombast (‘Queen of Peace’ rises and blooms like a firework display), but it feels somehow more personal than both the artist’s previous output and that of the majority of her contemporaries.\n\nIt should be mentioned also, that the 4-minute white rapids journey of opener ‘Ship to Wreck’ is quite possibly the best song I heard all year.\n\n###  17. Squarepusher — *Damogen Furies*\n\nOver a 20+ year career I’ve payed far too little attention to Squarepusher. The closest I got previously was a dip into 2010’s Shobaleader One: *d’Demonstrator* - itself a kind of spin-off album featuring an expanded lineup. *Damogen Furies* is my first exposure to Squarepusher-prime, and it’s left me a little shaken but thrilled and hungry for more. Comprising a host of somewhat raw-sounding electronica elements, settled in a bed of off-kilter, low wind instruments, or 16-bit era videogame chiptune soundscapes, the overall tone of the album is somewhere between menacing and schizophrenic — not dissimilar to Reznor’s OST for *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*.\n\nAt its most frenetic the drum patterning walks a line between highly measured and almost-freeform jazz, ricocheting all over the map and pulling the melodies into any number of new, convoluted forms. (One of my favourite examples of this is once ‘Baltang Ort’ gets past the 4.30 mark and loses its composure a bit; that last minute is insane.) It’s a remarkable achievement to make something so mechanical seem at the same time organic - responsive to shifts in the music’s mood.\n\n###  16. Will Butler — *Policy*\n\nWill Butler, here, has the same thing going for him as going against him: his membership of Arcade Fire. It’s doubtful — or at least significantly less likely — that I would have picked up this record without that background, and yet it comes freighted with a baggage that is entirely unfair. What Butler has produced is nothing more and nothing less than a collection of simple songs. Each one has an emotional directness familiar to listeners of his previous works, and they move between valences with aplomb. ‘Finish What I Started’ is a two-minute plea from the heart, and then it’s straight into ‘Son of God’: something close to an understated call for revolution.\n\nThere’s a smattering of multi-instrumentalism, but it sounds more like one man jumping from piano to keyboard to guitar, and less like the glorious, polychromatic racket that the collective of which he’s an integral part are capable of building. There’s also the nagging fact of how close Will’s voice is to that of brother Win. In a year without an Arcade Fire album this was a welcome dose of some watered-down substitute. That’s a very unfair thing to say about a pretty great album of alt-pop songs, but it was the feeling I couldn’t shake on the many occasions I listened to it. Sorry Will.\n\n###  15. Wolf Alice — *My Love is Cool*\n\nThe list of bands I listened to religiously in the mid-to-late 90s and early 2000s that are obvious influences on Wolf Alice is long. And there’s no effort made to disguise that here, on an album that feels both a little familiar and oddly quaint in its delivery of a 20+ year old sound. Opener ‘Turn to Dust’ is as pretty as it is alluring, with just a hint of sadness enough to make you wonder what other colours the band will paint with. It’s the sort of effortless conjuring of mood that Laura Marling displayed time and again on her first couple of albums. When, after just over 3 minutes, the album shifts into ‘Bros’, the listener is assured that they’re in safe hands; I certainly didn’t hear a prettier straight-ahead, guitar-led pop song this year - so simple in its construction, yet executed beautifully enough to bring a tear to my eye on several listens.\n\nI’m left with questions about what the future holds for Wolf Alice: another collection of easygoing pop-rock singalongs that risks diminishing returns, or the temptation to risk something that may be outside their comfort zone? For now though, we have a really solid debut that does one thing very well indeed.\n\n###  14. Fort Romeau — *Insides*\n\nI’d made the decision before the start of the year to listen to every 2015 release that Ghostly International put out, so – even if this hadn’t come recommended by Kieran Hebden — I would have run across it eventually.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the man behind Four Tet likes what fellow Brit Mike Greene is doing here: it occupies largely the same space as Hebden’s own *Rounds* (2003): a kind of warm, comfortable, trancelike feeling somewhere between early morning tiredness and lazy sunbeam comfort. There are denser moments, such as the bass-driven ‘All I Want’, but they are swells upon an otherwise even-tempered expanse of musical ocean.\n\n(This ended up being my favourite eligible Ghostly release for the year, though Shigeto’s *Intermission* EP, would be way up there if it was a little longer than 6 tracks & ~20 minutes.)\n\n###  13. Ibeyi — *Ibeyi*\n\nThe two voices at the heart of Ibeyi’s self-titled debut are almost indistinguishable, belonging as they do to twins: Naomi & Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Both are light, playful, and soulful, painting flowing lines over beds of minimal piano and simple beats. At times they’re also haunting, used to great effect in mirroring or weaving in and out of each other, such as on album highlight ‘River’ where they hold a kind of conversation amid the waves of their own background harmonising.\n\nIt no doubt helps that I first heard this record when we were in Copenhagen in February, and it’s linked in my mind with a great week we spent out there. The album’s sonic warmth conjures for me, every time, the warmth of the apartment we were staying in, and to which we returned after days walking in biting cold.\n\n###  12. Nils Frahm — *Solo*\n\nIn much the same way that Ghostly International started to colonise great swathes of my listening time a couple of years ago, London-based label Erased Tapes have made a huge impact for me recently: I got a lot of listening out of Kiasmos’s self-titled LP last year; A Winged Victory for the Sullen provided me with an unforgettable live experience in a Danish church this February... and there’s another ET artist elsewhere on this list. Hence it’s fitting that I came to Frahm via labelmate Ólafur Arnalds, a kindred spirit and sometime collaborator (they put out an EP together this year actually, which — though ineligible for The List — is a recommended listen also).\n\nIn terms of the album itself — a collection of masterfully constructed piano pieces —there’s not too much to say. There is some variation: the slightness of ‘Chant’ and the swell of ‘Wall’, but the album is best considered of a piece, and the mood it evokes is singular. The *Pitchfork* review phrased it this way: \n\n> \"[I]t’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.” \n\nFor me, it was, easily. On several occasions this year it was precisely the record I needed, and to which I turned when nothing else would do.\n\n###  11. The Sidekicks — *Runners in the Nerved World*\n\nI’m not sure how I came to listen to this; a January release that has stuck around tenaciously to claim a spot on The List, and has done so by charm more than anything else. Touchstones here are bands like The Shins and Saves the Day, and this record firmly filled the same spot this year as Local Natives’ *Hummingbird* a couple of years ago: the best example that happened to cross into my awareness of a musical style far more prevalent on these lists in the early 2000s and appearing with increasing rarity since. Nevertheless this is the real thing and faithfully delivered. Steve Ciolek’s voice is an empathetic through-line with a range between falsetto fragility and convincing moments of emotional conviction.\n\n'Blissfield, MI’ is the record’s high point, though its driving bravado is something of an outlier on an album primarily comprising prettier pop-rock. The track also contains the album’s best lyric; the kind of glimpse into personal emotional-geography that late ‘90s / early ’00s emo at its best did so well:\n\n> I feel like how the Bulls felt in 1993  \n> I feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me\n\n###  10. Shamir — *Ratchet*\n\nAnother debut album for The List, and another distinct vocal - Shamir Bailey’s performance is by turns fragile (in the manner of a Michael Jackson ballad), cocky, or occasionally fierce. Low-key opener ‘Vegas’ keys the listener into a couple of the record’s themes — sin, pleasure — but is quickly undercut in a piece of genius sequencing by ‘Make A Scene’: a none-more-pop chant littered with unidentifiable sound effects, something that sounds distinctly like cow-bell, and a vaulting laser effect that draws the listener’s ear up and over Bailey’s falsetto.\n\nThere are plenty of catchy — if insubstantial — pleasures on offer, but the best track on the album is inarguably ‘On The Regular’, also probably 2015’s most infectious song. Its blend of lightness, self-assurance, and touches of thematic darkness are a good microcosm of the album in general. In the final analysis though, it was Shamir’s ear for a hook and the wit of his lyrics that brought me back to this time and again.\n\n###  9. Purity Ring — *Another Eternity*\n\nFor whatever reason Purity Ring’s debut (*Shrines* (2012)) didn’t make it onto my radar, and my introduction to the band came when I asked Siri to identify a song which turned out to be ‘Bodyache’ in a coffee shop this summer. Not long after that I was hooked on an album delicately balancing bright, dense synths and a similarly-toned female vocal. There are a few rhythm & blues touches here and there (the cadence of ‘Repetition’ for example), but it’s one influence among a spectrum, all blended here amongst warm synth-swaths to produce an album it’s easy to submerge yourself in and not want to emerge from.\n\nThere’s nothing even slightly revolutionary here, but it’s an album — like Metric’s *Synthetica* (2012) and SBTRKT’s *Wonder Where We Land* (2014) — that builds a cohesive and vibrant world of sound that pulled me in and kept me entranced.\n\n###  8. Jamie xx — *In Colour*\n\nThere’s something very smart about Jamie xx’s marking this solo release by calling out in the title (and album cover) the contrast to The xx’s predominantly monochrome aesthetic. That relationship is carried through to the music also, with the record feeling more expansive, more energetic, and wider-ranging than the (superb) work Jamie’s put out alongside Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim. Touching on the same positive-vibes club scene sound as Four Tet’s recent output, the record moves at a pace and imparts a real warmth without ever moving much beyond third gear.\n\nOpener ‘Gosh’ is a cheeky statement of intent. ’Stranger in a Room’ is night-driving music; traffic-lights refracted through rain music - cool in tone and soporific. ‘Hold Tight’ is a helter-skelter, hypnotic headphone trip. ’Obvs’ even manages to make good use of one of my least-favourite instruments: the steel drum.\n\nI got a real kick out of this collection of assorted brighter, club-electronica sounds, and it’s left me even more excited for a third LP from The xx in 2016.\n\n###  7. Rival Consoles — *Howl*\n\nAnd here’s that other member of the Erased Tapes roster alluded to earlier. Ryan Lee West’s set of constantly shifting soundscapes put a spell on me this year. As with Squarepusher earlier in this list, this is electronic music engaged in the exploration of what happens when a pattern is disrupted, complicated, and altered. Not as fraught as the music on *Damogen Furies*, but just as restless, this is an album for headphones not just because of its density and intricacy, but also because of its propulsiveness. It’s music to walk to, run to, and ride rails to.\n\nEach track is distinct, none outstay their welcome, and West knows when he’s stretched a beat to its breaking point, and thus when to move on. There’s a melancholy to some of the album’s lower tones, but elsewhere there’s a playfulness, and energy to spare (such as displayed by the shuffling brush-played drums underneath album highlight ‘Low’). Closing track ‘Looming’ is perhaps the collection’s tightest package; the euphoric shivers of synth that run through it ringing out like harbingers of a sunrise.\n\n###  6. Nosaj Thing — *Fated*\n\nThere’s a tone and a tempo of electronica that I’ve been continuously hunting since Flying Lotus’s *Cosmogramma* put me under its spell in 2010. Shigeto’s *No Better Time Than Now* satisfied the itch in 2013, and last year the role was played by Submerse’s *Slow Waves*; in 2015 the honour goes to the third record by Jason Chung a.k.a. Nosaj Thing.\n\nLaid back to the point of near-horizontality, and characterised by nothing so much as a pervading sense of warmth, this is a species of electronic music that finds soul and humanity within the machines - blood in the wires. If I could pick a record of 2015 to live inside, it might well be *Fated*. The cover image is a simple black & white photo of Chung holding up a fork by the tines, a butter knife suspended from it at 6 o’clock, pulled by gravity and held by some quirk of magnetism. The album somehow feels the same: a long, suspended moment, slightly magical, in tune with chance. For whatever reason I think of this sub-category as liminal electronica - and, considering that that’s a musical genre that doesn’t exist outside of my head, Chung does a remarkable job of getting it just right.\n\n### 5. Metric — *Pagans in Vegas*\n\nThis album’s a disappointment within the limited framework of comparison to its predecessor: the flawless *Synthetica* (2012). Still present are the sure-footedly executed balance of pop sensibilities and underlying electro menace, the flawless understanding of what a key-change or lyrical twist can accomplish, and the sense of a band exploring every corner of their alt-electro-synth-pop palate.\n\nWhen the pace dipped I found myself losing interest just a little — something that never happened throughout *Synthetica* — and overall the quality is merely outstanding rather than genre-defining. There are exceptions: the effervescent ‘The Shade’, and the sly, shifting ’Cascades’ are every bit as good as I’d come to expect from Metric. In the final analysis this is a really solid continuation of the band’s sound, somewhat unfairly made to feel slight in comparison to a vastly superior previous album. And yet, these things must be put in context and this place in the top five is richly deserved.\n \n###  4. Toro y Moi — *What For?*\n\nThis is an album possessed of both a distinct sense of the mood it wants to invoke, and also a sense of humour about the single-mindedness with which it sets about the task. Smart, effortlessly cool, and rendered with a fresh clarity, the soul influences are worn as a badge of honour whilst the mismatch of laid-back delivery and sometimes heavier content is endlessly compelling.\n\nThe vocals are liberally treated with effects, but its done with such a holistic sense of the album’s sonic world that instead of risking distraction it instead echoes the warm distortion of the guitars, and serves to deepen the rich, swaying textures of the lower- tempo tracks. When the pace picks up on tracks like ‘Empty Nesters’ it takes the edge off the more cutting lyrics (“Call Mom & Dad because their nest is empty, and so are you”) and keeps the mood light. Aaron Gold’s drums perform the same trick throughout, keeping things light and moving swiftly.\n\nThe record’s finest moment comes in the shape of ‘Spell It Out’: a three-minute sideswipe that comes off like a simultaneous slap and kiss to the cheek.\n\n###  3. Grimes — *Art Angels*\n\nRumour has it that after the unexpected level of attention garnered by 2012’s *Visions*, Clare Boucher made an album’s worth of material — including ill-conceived single release ’Go’ — before scrapping the whole thing and starting again. If true it’s perhaps indicative of how seriously Boucher sees the task of representing herself truthfully through her art in the glare of intensified media interest.\n\nShe starts, simply, on the introductory ‘Laughing and Not Being Normal’, by reminding us that she has a spectacular voice, sometimes overlooked in commentary that focusses on her layering techniques and beat-making. From there she progresses into the achingly-beautiful ‘California’, which contains perhaps Grimes’s clearest method statement: \"I love this music / It sounds just like my soul\". And so unfolds a record democratic in its tastes, eclectic in its tone and tempo, and yet singularly focussed on the task of pure artistic expression. Whatever reception the release received it seems clear that the most important thing to the artist here was making a record she was happy with. And so she indulges every whim for the duration that it retains her attention: sweetness, savagery, choral melody, multi-layered spiral-staircase beats... and on.\n\n‘Kill V. Maim’ is the album’s centrepiece, a crucible for all this particularly brilliant form of compositional madness, and — by some miracle — one of the best synth-pop anthems since Robyn’s *Body Talk* five years ago.\n\n###  2. Sleater-Kinney — *No Cities to Love*\n\nWhere did this come from?\n\nI had a slight familiarity with S-K’s previous album: *The Woods* (2005), but that was a decade ago, and prior to that — in the pre-streaming / pre-download era — they’d never really crossed my radar other than as mentions in articles analysing the impact of grunge, listed alongside Belly and Sonic Youth, and a dozen other bands I never really connected with for whatever reason. So it comes as something of a surprise that I fell so hard for this album, having tuned in after hearing it compared to Wild Flag’s 2011 debut. (It’s pretty funny how clearly I had that influence the wrong way around.)\nReleased not three weeks into the year it was immediately obvious that this album would stick around for a place on The List. ‘Price Tag’ might be the best opening track of any album this year, and like ‘Surface Envy’, ‘A New Wave’ and... well, most of the album, it’s a ~3-minute masterpiece of concentrated energy driving forward a smart lyric.

Whatever the case, they’ve produced a near-perfect rock album with just the right levels of enthusiasm, menace, sadness, and empowering anger. The title track deserves special mention for balancing these elements particularly flawlessly, whilst showcasing the poppy lightness that keeps the whole record effervescing.\n\n###  1. Chvrches — *Every Open Eye*\n\nChvrches’ debut album reached number 4 on my 2013 list and so it’s fitting that this record, which represents a simultaneous strengthening and deepening of their sound, claims a higher spot. In truth the top three here came together pretty late. With Sleater-Kinney having been in pole position since release in Jan, and the Grimes LP not arriving until fairly late in the year, there was a bunch of late-in-the-day shuffling going on.\n\n*The Bones of What You Believe* was one of those records that I loved but which left me with questions as to how it would be followed up.

Somehow the fact that it resembles nothing more closely than The Pet Shop Boys does nothing to dilute the sheer joy of it.\n\nIt’s telling that album number two has pushed Chvrches straight to the top of my list of acts to see live ASAP. Bright, sweet, imbued with boundless energy, and yet knowing and highly polished, this record is a confection but one over which I carry no guilt for adoring.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

A thin, rectangular nose doesn’t entirely match the position of either eye, and is too close to the beginnings of a lower lip. The pen marks themselves may not have been enough, but something about the colouration: a reddish shoulder and then a band of yellow moving up through the right side of the face keyed my eye into the image - made it solid for me.</p>\n<p>It arrived this week and I couldn’t be happier with it.

A thin, rectangular nose doesn’t entirely match the position of either eye, and is too close to the beginnings of a lower lip. The pen marks themselves may not have been enough, but something about the colouration: a reddish shoulder and then a band of yellow moving up through the right side of the face keyed my eye into the image - made it solid for me. \n\nIt arrived this week and I couldn’t be happier with it. The next step is to find a frame that suits; in person the piece has subtle patches of translucency, and I’d like to find something that keeps that visible.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/9fef7ea4de.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I haven’t read a lot of Nordic fiction, but having recently returned from a first trip to Denmark, encountering a review of this new volume of Dorthe Nors’s work, I felt compelled to check it out. The book Pushkin Press has put out is actually a combination of Nors’s 2008 short story collection—<em>Karate Chop</em>—and a newer work: 2013’s prose-poem / novella, <em>Minna Needs Rehearsal Space</em>. I chose to dive into the latter first because I was intrigued by the form, and I remained so throughout its 89 pages.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole the work is decidedly more prosaic than poetic, although Nors nevertheless displays an assured understanding of rhythm and pace. To construct a narrative from largely declarative sentences, none of them long enough to break over two lines, demands a kind of discipline. Perhaps unavoidably, because of how the eye is drawn and how the language flows, the piece is quite propulsive. Nors exacerbates that by choosing to repeatedly start successive sentences with the same word. But within these constraints, she displays a great deal of tonal diversity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One shouldn’t hurt others unnecessarily.\nOne should above all be kind.\nMinna would rather not be anything but.\nMinna’s hardly anything but.\nThe email thunders through the ether toward Karin.\n<em>That’s as it should be</em>, thinks Minna.\nThe ether’s full of malicious messages.\nThe ether hums with break-ups and loss.\nThe ether is knives being thrown.\nThe ether is blood surging back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text moves from Minna’s point of view to comment on her inner monologue and shifts so often and so fluidly that it sometimes occupies a position not readily identifiable to the reader.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Minna and Jette sit <em>sans camouflage</em> in the midst of it all.\nJette’s eyes are insistent.\nMinna has a hard time relaxing.\nThe legs biking.\nThe arms warding off blows.\nThe body full of vim.\nThe soul supposed to sit still.\nIt ain’t easy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the bulk of <em>Minna Needs Rehearsal Space</em> in two large gulps. Partly because the text makes it so easy to slip into its stream and get pulled along, but also because it felt that at any one point I was learning something about the central character—either by revelation or inference—that reframed my understanding of the narrative, whilst drawing me forward to discover more. The writing is, in places, quite beautiful, and whilst it felt at the start that the odd format may be a distraction, that never proved to be the case; Nors’s economy of language always allowed the work’s ideas to shine all the more clearly, rather than diminishing them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dad’s hand and Minna’s.\nThe blue delta of Dad’s hand.\nThe sea rises in Minna.\nThe sea finds fissures in Minna.\nMinna’s leaky.\nMinna opens her eyes and blinks.\nThe sea tricks slowly.\nThe sea reaches land.\nThe beads of gravel rattle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Today we reached the end of week 11 of our training plan for this year’s London Marathon, and the order of the day was to go out and run a half marathon. Luckily, there was one being staged 30 minutes away, around the outskirts of Dartford. This was the 39th running of the Dartford Half Marathon, and the first year in which the event had been moved from its previous summer slot to a cooler time of year. This, and the fact that it now falls perfectly for those of us building up towards the big event in six weeks’ time, had swollen the number of participants to more than 600.</p>\n<p>The Dartford course — a little research told me ahead of time — is regarded as one of the toughest in the country, with three or four sizeable hills, the steepest of which comes about 10 miles into the race. Still, I was looking forward to the event. The previous three Sundays in the training plan had been beyond half marathon distance, with last Sunday being an 18 mile stretch that I’d found pretty punishing. I’d been having problems first with my right ankle and then — perhaps owing to overcompensating — my left knee, but the shorter runs during this week hadn’t posed any problems, and I felt good about the prospects of doing 13.1 miles at the pace I was aiming for — despite the hills.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, whilst doing a bit of final preparation — checking I had the details of the day straight in my mind etc. — I stumbled on an item in the FAQs that put a real kink in my race plans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In view of a raised awareness of the threat to safety… runners should not wear personal stereo equipment during this race. [A]nyone wearing such devices during the event will be disqualified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been running for a little over three years and I don’t think I’ve ever gone out for longer than 30 minutes without some form of audio accompaniment: music, podcasts, or an audiobook on longer stints. For me this kind of companionship serves a couple of purposes: music is motivating and helps me keep a rhythm, and listening to conversational podcasts or (usually fiction) audiobooks gives me something to involve myself with mentally as the miles tick past. The most important function, however, is to stop me thinking too much about the run. I have a terrible habit, left to my own devices, of constantly calculating the time elapsed vs. the likely time remaining; the pace of the previous mile and the pace of the present one, how they compare and what overall time would result from carrying on at one pace or altering up or down a gear. The prospect of listening to myself think like this for something like 2.5 hours was exhausting in and of itself.</p>\n<p>During the event however, there was something about running a route that was new to me (instead of my usual route, which I know very well), and being surrounded by other runners, which kept my mind occupied to some degree. There were still stretches, particularly in the latter half of the race when I found myself running alone for a while, that I caught myself doing the maths, but overall my mind felt relaxed and engaged.</p>\n<p>I did find the endeavour of running an ostensibly competitive race to be a bit strange. I’ve never really enjoyed playing competitive sports, and find my personality much more suited to running as I have sold it to myself: as a solo exercise, where my past self is my only competition. There is, however, still room for that conception whilst running within the framework of an organised, competitive event. I enjoyed the camaraderie that many of the competitors showed toward one another, and the encouragement of the course marshals, but when it came down to it I was by myself out there and had only myself to blame if I failed to meet the goals that I had set myself.</p>\n<p>I had in mind the rather arbitrary-sounding finish time of 2h 23m (extrapolated out from the 11 minute miles I had decided upon as my average pace goal), and in the end came in with a time of 2h 14m. My knee hurt a great deal in the aftermath of the race, but I’m convinced that was a result not of the overall length of the course, but of the pounding I gave it in the final two miles as I really pushed towards the line. Had I stuck to putting in miles of between 10m 30s and 11m 30s as planned, I think I could have run on for quite a while without any complaint from my legs.</p>\n<p>As I crossed the line and had the timing chip cut from my shoe, I was handed a medal for completing the race, and a ticket by a marshal who told me I’d won a spot prize: this turned out to be a big tub of chocolates, which were welcome, even if the set of stairs I had to traverse to claim them were not.</p>\n<p>I had only run half marathon distance three times prior to this race, and 2h 14m is a personal best by some way; I’m pretty happy with the effort, especially over such a tough course. The last two miles were done at a pace that I now most likely won’t reach again until after the London Marathon is complete. What remains is another six weeks of slowly, steadily training my body to accept longer distances. Hopefully the ankle problem is truly behind me. Hopefully the knee will repair over the coming week and be stronger for it. Perhaps the most interesting thing I took from today was the idea that just maybe when I take my place at the start line in London on 26 April, I don’t necessarily need to have my earphones in.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>What was the last song you became obsessed with? Around this time last year I was playing St. Vincent’s ‘Digital Witness’ <em>a lot</em>, and singing it, humming it, or running parts through in my mind even when the headphones weren’t in. I have a history of that: songs that hook into some recess in me and loop endlessly, happily away seemingly without much effort on my part to call them to mind.

				"content_text": "What was the last song you became obsessed with? Around this time last year I was playing St. Vincent’s ‘Digital Witness’ *a lot*, and singing it, humming it, or running parts through in my mind even when the headphones weren’t in. I have a history of that: songs that hook into some recess in me and loop endlessly, happily away seemingly without much effort on my part to call them to mind.

The first time I read the book it was as a fan of Murakami’s work, and over the last couple of weeks I’ve gone back through it as someone who is in training for their first marathon. It’s an odd book: a mix of autobiography, a kind of sports reportage, a little travel writing, and a healthy dose of something akin to philosophy.

People’s minds can’t be a complete blank. Human beings’ emotions are not strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum. What I mean is, the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as I run remain subordinate to that void. Lacking content, they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are my favourite passages of the book, when Murakami meditates on what running has meant to him — what it has taught him.

By running longer it’s like I can physically exhaust that portion of my discontent. It also makes me realize again how weak I am, how limited my abilities are. I become aware, physically, of these low points. And one of the results of running a little father than usual is that I become that much stronger. If I’m angry, I direct that anger toward myself. If I have a frustrating experience, I use that to improve myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Murakami gets close to something I have also found, expressing it more eloquently than I could.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-deru--1979\">20. Deru — <em>1979</em></h3>\n<p>I was introduced to Deru via his contributions to the <em>Outliers: Volume 1 - Iceland</em>\nproject, in which his minimalist electronic soundscapes provided the perfect\naccompaniment to long, languorous shots of Iceland’s stark landscapes. Over\nthe duration of an album the tone varies a little more, but retains a chill and a\nslight distance. I kept returning to this record to be present with it, simply\nbecause I like the colours it paints with and the patience with which it unfolds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-kiasmos--kiasmos\">19. Kiasmos — <em>Kiasmos</em></h3>\n<p>Billed as Ólafur Arnalds’s electronica side-project, Kiasmos sounds pretty much\nas that description would lead you to believe. Built around the basis of Arnalds’s\nsweeping strings and intricate, sensitive piano patterns, the augmentation\nprovided here by synths and drum machines simply serves to lend another\ntexture to the sound. Sometimes there’s a switch to a pace Arnalds rarely\nachieves in his solo work, but the majority of this record poses no surprises.\nRegardless, I found myself enjoying this again and again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-thom-yorke--tomorrows-modern-boxes\">18. Thom Yorke — <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em></h3>\n<p>Released by some unusual method — as is now the usual — and instantly\nfamiliar-feeling to anyone who listened to Radiohead’s <em>The King of Limbs</em> (2011)\nor Atoms for Peace’s <em>AMOK</em> (2013), <em>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</em> is nevertheless\nanother fine set of glitchy, angsty, intricate clockworks wound up and let loose\nby a master craftsman and endlessly curious tinkerer. Particularly if you\nenjoyed the album versions of tracks from Yorke’s <em>The Eraser</em> (2006), before\nthey morphed and grew slightly when Atoms for Peace came on board to play them live, you’ll feel right at home with this understated collection of modest\nbut accomplished work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-east-india-youth--total-strife-forever\">17. East India Youth — <em>Total Strife Forever</em></h3>\n<p>A complete mystery to me upon first listen, William Doyle’s set of glittering,\nswimming electronica eventually coalesced into something I felt I could get my\nhands around. Conversely, I learned the best way to do that was simply to allow\nit to wash over me. The titular quartet could have been released as a standalone\nwork, but surrounding those tracks with more tonally-varied pieces really\nserves to bring them into relief as the spine of the album but not its flesh. I’m\nnot a huge fan of Doyle’s falsetto vocal (which creeps in a few times here and\nthere and is underwhelming rather than wholly off-putting), but his ear for the\nmelodic throughline to a complex miasma of sound is impressive throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-liars--mess\">16. Liars — <em>Mess</em></h3>\n<p>No two Liars albums are the same, and in the shape of <em>Mess</em> they’ve released\nperhaps their best since the career high of <em>Drum’s Not Dead</em> (2006). Opener\n‘Mask Maker’ seems like a deliberate attempt to forewarn the listener that\nthey’re in for a rough ride, but if one can learn to lean into the swings and take\nthe bumps there’s so much here to be infected by. The album’s best track ‘Mess\non a Mission’ is perhaps the band’s best to date, not to mention the best theme\ntune for a non-existent, Warren Ellis-scripted, True Detective-on-\namphetamines, HBO show I can imagine. Liars are talented at conjuring the\nsound of nightmares, and are not afraid of unleashing music that is at first\nseemingly incomprehensible. Learn to love it however, and you’ll find a lot to\nlove.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-tycho--awake\">15. Tycho — <em>Awake</em></h3>\n<p>I caught up with this album so, so late in the year and have a feeling that given\ntime to blossom in my mind it may float further up this list. Quickly my\nfavourite release on label-of-the-year contender Ghostly International, <em>Awake</em> is\na stunning collection of sur-ambient tracks that swell and sweep along lines\nthat quickly seem familiar and yet continue to grow in the mind with each\nlisten. I can foresee this being a record I return to for quite a while to come; I’m\nalready kicking myself a little for not picking it up upon release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-sisyphus--sisyphus\">14. Sisyphus — <em>Sisyphus</em></h3>\n<p>I’m not even sure how I came across this record — perhaps via the Son Lux\nconnection — but even on first listen I was fascinated by its variety and by how\nsingular so many of its elements felt. Opening track ‘Calm it Down’ is\ndoubtlessly one of my tracks of 2014, and Serengeti’s laid-back, self-assured\nflow was one of the discoveries of the year for me. The album as a whole is\nrestlessly inventive - constantly trying on new styles, sometimes two or three\nwithin the space of a single track: soul, hip-hop, R&amp;B, electronica - they’re all in\nthe mix here, and the combination was consistently alluring to me. My favourite\nmoment at the time of writing is on ‘Booty Call’: the delivery of the line “Im’a\nkiss you like a bubble in the brooks.” I don’t even need to know what that\nactually means.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-aphex-twin--syro\">13. Aphex Twin — <em>Syro</em></h3>\n<p>The last time Richard James put out an Aphex Twin album my interest in\nelectronic music was very slight, but even then I knew the name and something\nof the reputation. <em>Syro</em> appeared amongst much fanfare in September, and\nhasn’t moved far down my ‘recently played’ list since. I used the term ‘restlessly\ninventive’ above to describe Sisyphus’s melange of styles, but it applies here too;\nI don’t think any two bars of <em>Syro</em> are identical; things are always shifting,\ndifferent elements of a track taking momentary prominence and then being\nsubverted or switched out for some other stem. Four months hasn’t scratched\nthe surface of unlocking <em>Syro</em> in my mind, but there’s something special about a\nrecord that still feels ultimately unknowable after so much play.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-manic-street-preachers--futurology\">12. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Futurology</em></h3>\n<p>At this point in their career it’s a wonder that the Manics are still able to\nsurprise. But, whilst the vast majority of its component parts are drawn from\nelsewhere in their storied history, <em>Futurology</em> still manages to arrange the\nbuilding-blocks into some wonderful new shapes. Billed as a poppier\ncounterpart to last year’s <em>Rewind the Film</em> the album finds the band going\nstraight ahead on some tracks (’Sex, Power, Love and Money’, ‘Between the\nClock and the Bed’) but still finding plenty of room for introspection (‘Walk me\nto the Bridge’) and edgier-sounding fare. ‘The Next Jet to Leave Moscow’ could\nonly have been written by a band old enough to harbour regrets; their\nwillingness to spill them and work them through like this is admirable, and to our benefit. When the sums are totalled up this is the fourth in a run of great,\nand very different-feeling, albums from The Manics since 2009.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-caribou--our-love\">11. Caribou — <em>Our Love</em></h3>\n<p>After a while spent in its company <em>Our Love</em> resolves into a beautiful collection\nof bright, spacious electronica. I found myself returning to it as a default album\nfor lightening an afternoon, or to run to in the evenings. Perfectly paced,\nmeticulously crafted rhythms are brought to life by an inventive instrumental\npalate that kept me guessing until it crept into my head completely. Album\nhighlight ‘Second Chance’ takes a gamble on the kind of vocal that commonly\nrenders tracks skippable for me, but for some indiscernible reason here makes it\nthe song I returned to most often. That’s just one of a thousand impeccable\ndecisions made by Dan Snaith in his production of a record that took up root on\nthe brighter end of my electronica spectrum and stayed firmly planted through\nthe darker months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-the-acid--liminal\">10. The Acid — <em>Liminal</em></h3>\n<p>&lsquo;Liminal&rsquo; is one of my favourite words, and one I perhaps over-used in poetry\nseminars. It’s also a word I apply mentally to certain albums and pieces of\nmusic. Deftones’ <em>White Pony</em> (2000) feels that way to me, as does <em>OK Computer</em> (1997) for some reason. The Acid (of whom the only member I was previously\nfamiliar with is Adam Freeland) have chosen a good title for their debut LP\nhowever: the music on <em>Liminal</em> emerges and grows organically, fades, shifts,\nand evokes powerfully its own sense of place.</p>\n<p>‘Creeper’ is propulsive and straining at itself to break free. ‘Basic Instinct’ is\nunderstated and makes good use of the vocal effect the record’s production\nrelies on throughout to mask a relatively slight range. I found that with this\nrecord, perhaps because it is so successful in evoking a particular mood, I had to\nbe in the right mood to play it - but when that mood hit there was little better\nthan spending time inside the world it builds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-nothing--guilty-of-everything\">9. Nothing — <em>Guilty Of Everything</em></h3>\n<p>The closest stylistic analogue for what Nothing are doing on their debut is\nshoegaze, but various elements of their sound push at and perhaps tear the\nedges of that envelope. Whilst tracks like ‘Endlessly’ are firmly within the tradition of My Bloody Valentine et al, ‘Get Well’ is too rhythmic and danceable, and ‘Somersault’ is closer to something from Hope of the States’ <em>The Lost Riots</em>\n(2004).</p>\n<p>Regardless, the production of the record understands well what the band’s\nambition is: to flood the listener’s head with glorious, monochrome noise so\nthat they feel subsumed by and imbued with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-taylor-mcferrin--early-riser\">8. Taylor McFerrin — <em>Early Riser</em></h3>\n<p>For some reason I didn’t listen to much jazz this year (Otis Brown III’s <em>The\nThought of You</em> perhaps the best jazz qua jazz LP I spent any significant time\nwith), and even this is borderline. McFerrin’s modus operandi is to interweave\nsoulful, understated electronica through elements of jazz (‘4am’, ‘Already\nThere’), R&amp;B (‘The Antidote’), and back into soul itself (opener, and entrant on\nthe track-of-the-year shortlist, ‘Postpartum’). Something about the resulting\nmix (perhaps the way it moves seamlessly from one sound to another) really\nworked for me. On weekend mornings and walks into work it was a pleasure to\nbe accompanied by this album which, in all its forms, suffuses light and good\nfeeling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-run-the-jewels--run-the-jewels-2\">7. Run The Jewels — <em>Run The Jewels 2</em></h3>\n<p>Hip-hop didn’t come through for me this year either. The new Common album\ndidn’t get close to the hype, the long-awaited Wu Tang Clan LP had its moments\nbut was never going to be a classic, and the same goes for The Roots’ <em>…And\nThen You Shoot Your Cousin</em>. Kanye took a year off, Jay-Z took a year off, who\nknows if Yasiin Bey / Mos Def is working on anything?</p>\n<p>Anyway, all of which set the stage for something new and Run The Jewels took\nfull advantage. El-P is a decent rapper and a flat-out great beat-maker. With this\nrecord following up 2013’s <em>R.A.P. Music</em> Killer Mike is making a play for Kanye’s\ncrown, with a knack for twisted, quotable, clever lyrics and an incredible,\nrelaxed flow that drives the record.</p>\n<p>The album is obviously conceived as a whole - it wouldn’t surprise me to find\nthat El-P considered the sequencing as carefully as any individual beat. ‘Jeapordy’ comes with no warning, things build on ‘Oh My Darling Don’t Cry’ and when the beat drops on ‘Blockbuster Night Part 1’ I just about lose it each time. But then it goes up another level on ‘Close Your Eyes’, which also happens to feature Zach de la Rocha’s best verse since he stepped out for Saul Williams in 2004.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-the-new-pornographers--brill-bruisers\">6. The New Pornographers — <em>Brill Bruisers</em></h3>\n<p>I was a big fan of <em>Twin Cinema</em> (2005) but haven’t exactly flipped for the two\nNew Pornographers records between then and now. <em>Brill Bruisers</em>, however, is\nan unqualified triumph. The opening track is bombastic and sing-along whilst\nalso proving a great showcase for the band’s huge sound. I love the way\n‘Champions of Red Wine’ shimmers and builds, and ‘War on the East Coast’\npulls a bait and switch by flipping from dirge to glam in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>Carl Newman refers to Brill Bruisers as &ldquo;a celebration record&rdquo; and certainly it\nsticks to the brighter, more upbeat end of the band’s spectrum. The production\nis outstanding, and having several male and female vocalists allows for a\ndialogue and a lyrical dynamic that works here as it does for Arcade Fire. Take\nfor example album best ‘Born With A Sound’, which could easily find a home on\n<em>The Suburbs</em>: when Amber Webber sings “I want you all of the time” by herself a\nshiver runs through me without fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-submerse--slow-waves\">5. Submerse — <em>Slow Waves</em></h3>\n<p>With the majority of what I listen to these days falling somewhere on the\nelectronica spectrum, Submerse managed to pinpoint precisely where my head\nis with this stuff at the moment. Lushly-produced, infinitely warm\nsoundscapes, and wonderfully balanced instrumentation helped make this\nprobably my most-played album of 2014.</p>\n<p>Other plaudits headed <em>Slow Waves’s</em> way include best album cover of the year\nand best opening track in the form of the stunning ’Let’s Never Come Back Here\nAgain’. Other highlights include the alluring wash of ‘Snorlax’ and ‘VHS.chords’,\nwhich weaves circa–8-bit videogame sound effects subtly through its ebb and\nflow. I’ve been struggling to pinpoint precisely what it is that Rob Orme (aka\nSubmerse) does so well, and I think the key to this sound is the perfect balance\nof organic-seeming electronica: there’s nothing cold here, it all feels very much\nas though each of its musical capillaries is pulsing with warmth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-spoon--they-want-my-soul\">4. Spoon — <em>They Want My Soul</em></h3>\n<p>The narrative around the release of this record was all too concerned with the\nlongevity of the band’s career. As someone with — for better or worse — limited prior\nconnection with Spoon, I was able to look at the album objectively and found it\nto be nothing less or more complicated than a great rock record.</p>\n<p>It’s a cleverly sequenced album: ‘Rent I Pay’ is a statement of intent to open\nwith, ‘Inside Out’ is more ruminative, slightly poppier, and ‘Rainy Taxi’ serves\nto display a cutting edge. Most of these 10 tracks move between moods\nthroughout their runtime, as though the band have too many great ideas for one\nalbum. Nothing feels forced or poorly-executed however - it’s clear without\nknowing the back catalogue that this is a group of musicians very assured in\nwhat they’re making.</p>\n<p>The warm, just-fuzzy-enough production is outstanding, and is tweaked\nmasterfully to fit around each song just perfectly. I’ll be playing the title track\nand the bombastic, anthem to bravery ’Let Me Be Mine’ for a long while to come - as well as most of the rest of the album I should think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-sbtrkt--wonder-where-well-land\">3. SBTRKT — <em>Wonder Where We’ll Land</em></h3>\n<p>Previous to this year my only knowledge of SBTRKT was via a couple of (pretty\ngreat) Radiohead remixes (of ‘Everything In Its Right Place’ &amp; ‘Lotus Flower’).\nThe path to changing that was an odd one: I picked up the single ’NEW DORP.\nNEW YORK’ via Ezra Koenig’s Twitter, and liked but didn’t love it. That was\nenough to get me to tune into the album via Rdio, and soon after I had\npurchased it and was playing a couple of tracks more-or-less daily. There’s a\ngreat variety of styles on display over the generous 15 track running order, but I\nstarted to get even more out of the record when it clicked for me that it had been\nbuilt for consumption as a whole.</p>\n<p>‘The Light’ sounds like it belongs on a sexier version of <em>Hail To The Thief</em>;\n’Temporary View’ — tinged with R&amp;B — is plaintive and uplifting; ‘Higher’\nfeatures Raury delivering probably my favourite hip-hop vocal performance of\nthe year.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason even the outlets I’m usually fairly in sync with on music\nwere relatively down on this record (Pitchfork: 55%; Resident Advisor: 5/10).\nThat’s a puzzle to me as I continue to find new reasons to love a huge, warm\nalbum in which it’s a pleasure to get lost for a while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-st-vincent--st-vincent\">2. St. Vincent — <em>St. Vincent</em></h3>\n<p>I really liked Annie Clark’s 2009 album <em>Actor</em>, but this record quickly inspired a\nwhole new level of devotion. That was the case right from the release of ‘Digital\nWitness’ on the sixth day of the year - a track I’m still playing regularly 12\nmonths later and have not grown the slightest bit tired of.</p>\n<p>‘Birth in Reverse’ is all angular guitar and too-deep grooves, ‘Bring Me Your\nLoves’ makes something astounding out of the under-practiced sub-genre of\nlament-as-anthem. But it’s ‘Digital Witness’ that still rings the clearest for me as\nthe album’s centrepiece: in tone and subject matter a kissing-cousin to much of\nArcade Fire’s <em>Reflektor</em>, and just as stirring to each the heart, head, and hips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-death-from-above-1979--the-physical-world\">1. Death From Above 1979 — <em>The Physical World</em></h3>\n<p>I still remember the day in 2006 when I read the post on DFA1979’s website in\nwhich Jesse Keller used those fateful words: “We decided to stop doing the\nband…”. That was two years after having released the singularly powerful <em>You’re\nA Woman, I’m A Machine</em> and thereby shifting my whole conception of how\nmuch noise two people could make, as well as altering the topography of the\npost-punk landscape.</p>\n<p>It’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of\nthis second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of\nthe first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve\nthe band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power\nis a kind of compound triptych miracle.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, a neat accompaniment to the album was also released this year in\nthe form of Eva Michon’s insightful, up-close-and-personal doc <em>Life After Death\nFrom Above 1979</em>, which chronicles the tour cycle of the first record, the falling\napart, and the reconstitution of the band.)</p>\n<p>‘Right On, Frankenstein!’ &amp; ‘The Physical World’ are my favourite tracks here,\nbut the whole thing is pretty outstanding from start to finish. Brutal, danceable,\nchantable, and full of great hooks - I couldn’t be happier to have DFA1979 back\nin the world.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Deru — *1979*\n\nI was introduced to Deru via his contributions to the *Outliers: Volume 1 - Iceland*\nproject, in which his minimalist electronic soundscapes provided the perfect\naccompaniment to long, languorous shots of Iceland’s stark landscapes. Over\nthe duration of an album the tone varies a little more, but retains a chill and a\nslight distance. I kept returning to this record to be present with it, simply\nbecause I like the colours it paints with and the patience with which it unfolds.\n\n###  19. Kiasmos — *Kiasmos*\n\nBilled as Ólafur Arnalds’s electronica side-project, Kiasmos sounds pretty much\nas that description would lead you to believe. Built around the basis of Arnalds’s\nsweeping strings and intricate, sensitive piano patterns, the augmentation\nprovided here by synths and drum machines simply serves to lend another\ntexture to the sound. Sometimes there’s a switch to a pace Arnalds rarely\nachieves in his solo work, but the majority of this record poses no surprises.\nRegardless, I found myself enjoying this again and again.\n\n###  18. Thom Yorke — *Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes*\n\nReleased by some unusual method — as is now the usual — and instantly\nfamiliar-feeling to anyone who listened to Radiohead’s *The King of Limbs* (2011)\nor Atoms for Peace’s *AMOK* (2013), *Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes* is nevertheless\nanother fine set of glitchy, angsty, intricate clockworks wound up and let loose\nby a master craftsman and endlessly curious tinkerer. Particularly if you\nenjoyed the album versions of tracks from Yorke’s *The Eraser* (2006), before\nthey morphed and grew slightly when Atoms for Peace came on board to play them live, you’ll feel right at home with this understated collection of modest\nbut accomplished work.\n\n###  17. East India Youth — *Total Strife Forever*\n\nA complete mystery to me upon first listen, William Doyle’s set of glittering,\nswimming electronica eventually coalesced into something I felt I could get my\nhands around. Conversely, I learned the best way to do that was simply to allow\nit to wash over me. The titular quartet could have been released as a standalone\nwork, but surrounding those tracks with more tonally-varied pieces really\nserves to bring them into relief as the spine of the album but not its flesh. I’m\nnot a huge fan of Doyle’s falsetto vocal (which creeps in a few times here and\nthere and is underwhelming rather than wholly off-putting), but his ear for the\nmelodic throughline to a complex miasma of sound is impressive throughout.\n\n###  16. Liars — *Mess*\n\nNo two Liars albums are the same, and in the shape of *Mess* they’ve released\nperhaps their best since the career high of *Drum’s Not Dead* (2006). Opener\n‘Mask Maker’ seems like a deliberate attempt to forewarn the listener that\nthey’re in for a rough ride, but if one can learn to lean into the swings and take\nthe bumps there’s so much here to be infected by. The album’s best track ‘Mess\non a Mission’ is perhaps the band’s best to date, not to mention the best theme\ntune for a non-existent, Warren Ellis-scripted, True Detective-on-\namphetamines, HBO show I can imagine. Liars are talented at conjuring the\nsound of nightmares, and are not afraid of unleashing music that is at first\nseemingly incomprehensible. Learn to love it however, and you’ll find a lot to\nlove.\n\n###  15. Tycho — *Awake*\n\nI caught up with this album so, so late in the year and have a feeling that given\ntime to blossom in my mind it may float further up this list. Quickly my\nfavourite release on label-of-the-year contender Ghostly International, *Awake* is\na stunning collection of sur-ambient tracks that swell and sweep along lines\nthat quickly seem familiar and yet continue to grow in the mind with each\nlisten. I can foresee this being a record I return to for quite a while to come; I’m\nalready kicking myself a little for not picking it up upon release.\n\n###  14. Sisyphus — *Sisyphus*\n\nI’m not even sure how I came across this record — perhaps via the Son Lux\nconnection — but even on first listen I was fascinated by its variety and by how\nsingular so many of its elements felt. Opening track ‘Calm it Down’ is\ndoubtlessly one of my tracks of 2014, and Serengeti’s laid-back, self-assured\nflow was one of the discoveries of the year for me. The album as a whole is\nrestlessly inventive - constantly trying on new styles, sometimes two or three\nwithin the space of a single track: soul, hip-hop, R&B, electronica - they’re all in\nthe mix here, and the combination was consistently alluring to me. My favourite\nmoment at the time of writing is on ‘Booty Call’: the delivery of the line “Im’a\nkiss you like a bubble in the brooks.” I don’t even need to know what that\nactually means.\n\n###  13. Aphex Twin — *Syro*\n\nThe last time Richard James put out an Aphex Twin album my interest in\nelectronic music was very slight, but even then I knew the name and something\nof the reputation. *Syro* appeared amongst much fanfare in September, and\nhasn’t moved far down my ‘recently played’ list since. I used the term ‘restlessly\ninventive’ above to describe Sisyphus’s melange of styles, but it applies here too;\nI don’t think any two bars of *Syro* are identical; things are always shifting,\ndifferent elements of a track taking momentary prominence and then being\nsubverted or switched out for some other stem. Four months hasn’t scratched\nthe surface of unlocking *Syro* in my mind, but there’s something special about a\nrecord that still feels ultimately unknowable after so much play.\n\n###  12. Manic Street Preachers — *Futurology*\n\nAt this point in their career it’s a wonder that the Manics are still able to\nsurprise. But, whilst the vast majority of its component parts are drawn from\nelsewhere in their storied history, *Futurology* still manages to arrange the\nbuilding-blocks into some wonderful new shapes. Billed as a poppier\ncounterpart to last year’s *Rewind the Film* the album finds the band going\nstraight ahead on some tracks (’Sex, Power, Love and Money’, ‘Between the\nClock and the Bed’) but still finding plenty of room for introspection (‘Walk me\nto the Bridge’) and edgier-sounding fare. ‘The Next Jet to Leave Moscow’ could\nonly have been written by a band old enough to harbour regrets; their\nwillingness to spill them and work them through like this is admirable, and to our benefit. When the sums are totalled up this is the fourth in a run of great,\nand very different-feeling, albums from The Manics since 2009.\n\n###  11. Caribou — *Our Love*\n\nAfter a while spent in its company *Our Love* resolves into a beautiful collection\nof bright, spacious electronica. I found myself returning to it as a default album\nfor lightening an afternoon, or to run to in the evenings. Perfectly paced,\nmeticulously crafted rhythms are brought to life by an inventive instrumental\npalate that kept me guessing until it crept into my head completely. Album\nhighlight ‘Second Chance’ takes a gamble on the kind of vocal that commonly\nrenders tracks skippable for me, but for some indiscernible reason here makes it\nthe song I returned to most often. That’s just one of a thousand impeccable\ndecisions made by Dan Snaith in his production of a record that took up root on\nthe brighter end of my electronica spectrum and stayed firmly planted through\nthe darker months.\n\n###  10. The Acid — *Liminal*\n\n'Liminal' is one of my favourite words, and one I perhaps over-used in poetry\nseminars. It’s also a word I apply mentally to certain albums and pieces of\nmusic. Deftones’ *White Pony* (2000) feels that way to me, as does *OK Computer* (1997) for some reason. The Acid (of whom the only member I was previously\nfamiliar with is Adam Freeland) have chosen a good title for their debut LP\nhowever: the music on *Liminal* emerges and grows organically, fades, shifts,\nand evokes powerfully its own sense of place.\n\n‘Creeper’ is propulsive and straining at itself to break free. ‘Basic Instinct’ is\nunderstated and makes good use of the vocal effect the record’s production\nrelies on throughout to mask a relatively slight range. I found that with this\nrecord, perhaps because it is so successful in evoking a particular mood, I had to\nbe in the right mood to play it - but when that mood hit there was little better\nthan spending time inside the world it builds.\n\n###  9. Nothing — *Guilty Of Everything*\n\nThe closest stylistic analogue for what Nothing are doing on their debut is\nshoegaze, but various elements of their sound push at and perhaps tear the\nedges of that envelope. Whilst tracks like ‘Endlessly’ are firmly within the tradition of My Bloody Valentine et al, ‘Get Well’ is too rhythmic and danceable, and ‘Somersault’ is closer to something from Hope of the States’ *The Lost Riots*\n(2004).\n\nRegardless, the production of the record understands well what the band’s\nambition is: to flood the listener’s head with glorious, monochrome noise so\nthat they feel subsumed by and imbued with it.\n\n###  8. Taylor McFerrin — *Early Riser*\n\nFor some reason I didn’t listen to much jazz this year (Otis Brown III’s *The\nThought of You* perhaps the best jazz qua jazz LP I spent any significant time\nwith), and even this is borderline. McFerrin’s modus operandi is to interweave\nsoulful, understated electronica through elements of jazz (‘4am’, ‘Already\nThere’), R&B (‘The Antidote’), and back into soul itself (opener, and entrant on\nthe track-of-the-year shortlist, ‘Postpartum’). Something about the resulting\nmix (perhaps the way it moves seamlessly from one sound to another) really\nworked for me. On weekend mornings and walks into work it was a pleasure to\nbe accompanied by this album which, in all its forms, suffuses light and good\nfeeling.\n\n###  7. Run The Jewels — *Run The Jewels 2*\n\nHip-hop didn’t come through for me this year either. The new Common album\ndidn’t get close to the hype, the long-awaited Wu Tang Clan LP had its moments\nbut was never going to be a classic, and the same goes for The Roots’ *…And\nThen You Shoot Your Cousin*. Kanye took a year off, Jay-Z took a year off, who\nknows if Yasiin Bey / Mos Def is working on anything?\n\nAnyway, all of which set the stage for something new and Run The Jewels took\nfull advantage. El-P is a decent rapper and a flat-out great beat-maker. With this\nrecord following up 2013’s *R.A.P. Music* Killer Mike is making a play for Kanye’s\ncrown, with a knack for twisted, quotable, clever lyrics and an incredible,\nrelaxed flow that drives the record.\n\nThe album is obviously conceived as a whole - it wouldn’t surprise me to find\nthat El-P considered the sequencing as carefully as any individual beat. ‘Jeapordy’ comes with no warning, things build on ‘Oh My Darling Don’t Cry’ and when the beat drops on ‘Blockbuster Night Part 1’ I just about lose it each time. But then it goes up another level on ‘Close Your Eyes’, which also happens to feature Zach de la Rocha’s best verse since he stepped out for Saul Williams in 2004.\n\n###  6. The New Pornographers — *Brill Bruisers*\n\nI was a big fan of *Twin Cinema* (2005) but haven’t exactly flipped for the two\nNew Pornographers records between then and now. *Brill Bruisers*, however, is\nan unqualified triumph.

I love the way\n‘Champions of Red Wine’ shimmers and builds, and ‘War on the East Coast’\npulls a bait and switch by flipping from dirge to glam in the blink of an eye.\n\nCarl Newman refers to Brill Bruisers as \"a celebration record\" and certainly it\nsticks to the brighter, more upbeat end of the band’s spectrum. The production\nis outstanding, and having several male and female vocalists allows for a\ndialogue and a lyrical dynamic that works here as it does for Arcade Fire. Take\nfor example album best ‘Born With A Sound’, which could easily find a home on\n*The Suburbs*: when Amber Webber sings “I want you all of the time” by herself a\nshiver runs through me without fail.\n\n###  5. Submerse — *Slow Waves*\n\nWith the majority of what I listen to these days falling somewhere on the\nelectronica spectrum, Submerse managed to pinpoint precisely where my head\nis with this stuff at the moment. Lushly-produced, infinitely warm\nsoundscapes, and wonderfully balanced instrumentation helped make this\nprobably my most-played album of 2014.\n\nOther plaudits headed *Slow Waves’s* way include best album cover of the year\nand best opening track in the form of the stunning ’Let’s Never Come Back Here\nAgain’.

St. Vincent — *St. Vincent*\n\nI really liked Annie Clark’s 2009 album *Actor*, but this record quickly inspired a\nwhole new level of devotion. That was the case right from the release of ‘Digital\nWitness’ on the sixth day of the year - a track I’m still playing regularly 12\nmonths later and have not grown the slightest bit tired of.\n\n‘Birth in Reverse’ is all angular guitar and too-deep grooves, ‘Bring Me Your\nLoves’ makes something astounding out of the under-practiced sub-genre of\nlament-as-anthem.

Death From Above 1979 — *The Physical World*\n\nI still remember the day in 2006 when I read the post on DFA1979’s website in\nwhich Jesse Keller used those fateful words: “We decided to stop doing the\nband…”. That was two years after having released the singularly powerful *You’re\nA Woman, I’m A Machine* and thereby shifting my whole conception of how\nmuch noise two people could make, as well as altering the topography of the\npost-punk landscape.\n\nIt’s been a long decade since that incredible debut, and the mere existence of\nthis second record is something like a miracle; that it lives up to the standard of\nthe first record is a second-order miracle; and that it also finds ways to evolve\nthe band’s unmistakable sound without sacrificing its authenticity or its power\nis a kind of compound triptych miracle.\n\n(As an aside, a neat accompaniment to the album was also released this year in\nthe form of Eva Michon’s insightful, up-close-and-personal doc *Life After Death\nFrom Above 1979*, which chronicles the tour cycle of the first record, the falling\napart, and the reconstitution of the band.)\n\n‘Right On, Frankenstein!’ & ‘The Physical World’ are my favourite tracks here,\nbut the whole thing is pretty outstanding from start to finish. Brutal, danceable,\nchantable, and full of great hooks - I couldn’t be happier to have DFA1979 back\nin the world.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Time for far too many words of tech nerdery, as I put the two premiere &lsquo;read-it-later&rsquo; services head-to-head in order to determine which I should be using at present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"icon\">Icon</h3>\n<p>In the first instance, I place quite a lot of stock—perhaps too much—in how my iPhone’s home screen looks. The Pocket icon is pleasingly colourful and for whatever reason the hint at depth that plays along the lower edge doesn’t look out of place amidst the otherwise flat sensibility of iOS 7.</p>\n<p>The Instapaper icon has two weaknesses as far as my taste is concerned: firstly it’s black and white, so lets the side down a bit in terms of my home screen’s otherwise pretty colourful array, and secondly it features a prominent capital ‘I’ that (through some quirk of how my brain is wired) I cannot help but pronounce to myself, inwardly, every time I see it. (See also why I can’t have the Tumblr, Vine, or Medium apps on the front page.)</p>\n<p>I also quite dig that little Pocket icon, and enjoy seeing it on an extension in Safari, and appearing on tweets that feature links. Far more distinctive, in both cases, than a lone capital letter.</p>\n<p>So, so very subjective but this round goes to: <strong>Pocket</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"web-ui\">Web UI</h3>\n<p>The article list in Pocket doesn’t quite get things right for me in either of its available formats. The tile view looks good, in the majority of cases, for items that feature an image—though sometimes the auto-cropping makes things messy—but pure text items kind of drown and the snippet of text that’s applied as a descriptor is often nonsensical. The list view is similarly short of ideas as to what to do about items without an image, and settles for putting an ugly placeholder next to them. At least the applied tags are visible in the list view however, whereas they’re inexplicably hidden in the tile layout.</p>\n<p>The menus and iconography within the Pocket interface all err on the side of chunkiness. It’s all pretty clean, and the rounded human-sans type makes it seem friendly where Instapaper is more functional, but at times it feels a bit cumbersome - it allows itself too much space and feels inelegant for it. My biggest pet peeve is the occasional appearance of a big yellow button, clearly a hold over from the service’s previous incarnation as Read It Later, it just feels entirely out of place. I do, however, like the choice of a central menu that drops down from the logotype - it looks great and gives quick access to all of the service’s elements.</p>\n<p>Where Pocket is blocky and colourful, Instapaper is stark in black &amp; white and (particularly in the ‘Compact’ iteration I prefer) makes great, functional use of every centimetre of screen space. No clumsily auto-generated snippet text, no mis-cropped images, just a crisp and functional UI with a familiar sidebar element. Though I have come to prefer tagging to folders as an organising principle, the folder implementation of Instapaper works well enough with the one exception that I wish filed items still remained in ‘Archive’, keeping that as a universal list of read items.</p>\n<p>The iconography isn’t quite as good as Pocket’s, but it works, and the split between a sans serif face for UI items and a serif for content works exceptionally well. Perhaps Instapaper’s biggest advantage of all in this area though is the simple inclusion of an edit function. Allowing me to tweak an article title to my liking allows me to keep things nice and neat, especially important when archiving for future consultation.</p>\n<p>Hands down this goes to <strong>Instapaper</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"app-ui\">App UI</h3>\n<p>Pocket’s formatting of its item list is more forgivable within the apps, where the pictures are smaller and items that don’t have them do not look as out of place. The tags are visible too! The slide-out main menu looks great and works well and the iconography is strong enough to make the ‘swipe left and choose an icon’ school of actions work flawlessly. Perhaps it’s my feeble brain, but still when I attempt this move within the Instapaper app I occasionally mistake the ‘Folder’ icon for ‘Archive’, and the ‘Archive’ icon proper for a non-existent ‘Print’ function.</p>\n<p>In fact, Instapaper’s app UI is a backwards step, not allowing the ‘Compact’ view I prefer on the web, the mandatory couple of lines snipped from the body of the icon make things look busy and untidy. On iPad things are even worse: tile view is mandatory and personally I find it ugly as all heck.</p>\n<p>In terms of pure looks, <strong>Pocket</strong> has the upper hand on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reading-experience\">Reading experience</h3>\n<p>There’s really not much in this. On the web both services do a good job of delivering on their <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em>: they get out of the way and leave the screen to cleanly presented text. Pocket only features a binary choice with respect to typography: serif or sans-serif, but the sans that’s provided is pleasant enough on the eye, particularly on iOS. Instapaper has a slight upper hand by providing more options, including Lyon - perhaps my favourite face for longform, screen-based reading.</p>\n<p>It’s a slight shame that the header bar is always present when viewing Pocket content on the web, but equally irritating is the habit of Instapaper’s header to fade eye-catchingly back into view as soon as one scrolls up a few pixels. It’s a tie on that score.</p>\n<p>In fact overall it’s just about even, but I’ll give it to <strong>Instapaper</strong> by a nose just because Lyon is an option.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds\">Feeds</h3>\n<p>This is a tricky one for me because I’m unusually sensitive to the underlying relationships between these read-later apps and other parts of my workflow.</p>\n<p>Taking Instapaper first: the service is owned by Betaworks, who also operate the RSS reader service Digg Reader. To use one without the other seems counterintuitive to me, and yet Betaworks don’t make things easy. Perhaps hedging their bets they have retained a ‘save for later’ function within Digg Reader, as well as an Instapaper option. To further complicate things the option exists to automatically send to Instapaper any item that is marked to save for later. Not a huge deal perhaps, but it bugs me every time I encounter it and have to make a false choice.</p>\n<p>Feedly has been my RSS service of choice since the demise of Google Reader, and its pro version professes close ties to both Pocket and Evernote. That sounds like the sort of airtight setup that holds a lot of appeal to me, but the reality is a little underwhelming… (see below)</p>\n<p>In truth both Pocket &amp; Instapaper are fairly universal export options within most feed reading clients at this point, so it’s hard not to make this one <strong>a tie</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"note-taking--clipping\">Note-taking / clipping</h3>\n<p>Currently at least, Feedly &amp; Pocket’s vaunted close ties to Evernote extend exactly as far as the option to simply send the entire text of an article to a notebook of your choice. Ironically it’s Instapaper (not, to my knowledge, an Evernote ‘partner’) that has the more granular integration. With the recent addition of its ‘highlighting’ function, and the option to automatically send highlighted passages to Evernote, Instapaper makes for a very neat clipping tool. There’s still some tidying up to do on the Evernote end as each highlight comes through as a separate note regardless of whether several originate form the same item within Instapaper, but it’s a step in a very interesting direction and cuts out a bit of the work of having a separate app open into which to paste clipped passages.</p>\n<p>Pocket doesn’t have anything like this… so it’s really down to the user to provide their own solution. Which is why, <strong>Instapaper</strong> takes this round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bookmarking\">Bookmarking</h3>\n<p>With folders or tagging, both services offer a decent device for maintaining an archive of read material. Still, I use a bookmarking service (Pinboard) for interesting sites and content of various stripes, and it’s nice to be able to have select content that has passed through my read-later service also be stored there. Instapaper has a setting whereby any item that gets ‘Liked’ gets sent on to Pinboard. For the most part this works exceptionally well, with the slight exception that the entry in Pinboard is marked as private without any option to change this. The vast majority of my Pinboard content is public, which means a little bit of curation is still needed on my part once ‘Liked’ Instapaper items make their way over there. There’s also the choice to send any given item to Pinboard manually without the need to ‘Like’ it.</p>\n<p>Pocket doesn’t offer a solution to manually send items to Pinboard, or to automatically export ‘Favourite’ items.

				"content_html": "<p>Even if you’re not hugely into comics there’s a good chance you understand why you’ll never see Superman arm-wrestle Thor, or Batman and Iron Man having a conversation about who’s richer and has cooler gadgets. For the longest time there have been two major players in the world of comics publishing—Marvel &amp; DC—and in each of the above examples the two characters fall on either side of that divide. <em>The Avengers</em> brings together multiple Marvel characters, and the upcoming <em>Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> will see DC’s two titans on the same screen, but never the twain shall meet.</p>\n<p>What might be less clear however, is why certain Marvel characters never seem to run into each other on the silver screen. The Avengers movie, and the solo adventures of all its constituent members (plus the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->S.H.I.E.L.D.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> TV show), are happening in one continuity. It’s fun to watch that universe grow, and look for cameos and references across the films, but to a fan of the comics it’s frustratingly obvious to see the film-makers run up against the limits of what they are permitted to show or even reference. Put simply, it’s a drag to know you’ll never see any two of Hulk, Wolverine and Spider-Man in the same frame.</p>\n<p>The mystical force that keeps these universes separate is something more powerful than the Infinity Gauntlet, or the Tesseract, and far more insidious even than the Aether… it’s the immutable power of copyright law! Whilst Marvel owns all the rights to the use of its characters in print and on TV, the film rights are a different and more complicated story. Believe it or not there was a time in the distant and murky past (the 1990s) when superhero movies were not a permanent fixture of the box office. The Batman movies of the day were unsuccessful both as action films and in the camp comedy they reached for, and <em>Jurassic Park</em> (1993) and <em>Independence Day</em> (1996) set the templates for the summer blockbuster. It was in this climate that Marvel began selling movie rights to its characters. Spider-Man went to Sony, X-Men went to Fox, and both grew successful franchises out of what they had bought. So successful in fact that Marvel took the decision to begin producing their own films based on the properties they retained, beginning with <em>Iron Man</em> (2008).</p>\n<p>Under the guidance of Avi Arad and Kevin Feige, the series of films that introduced Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, and then assembled them for <em>Marvel’s The Avengers</em> (2012) has become the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series\">second highest-grossing film franchise in history</a>.

				"content_text": "Even if you’re not hugely into comics there’s a good chance you understand why you’ll never see Superman arm-wrestle Thor, or Batman and Iron Man having a conversation about who’s richer and has cooler gadgets. For the longest time there have been two major players in the world of comics publishing—Marvel & DC—and in each of the above examples the two characters fall on either side of that divide. *The Avengers* brings together multiple Marvel characters, and the upcoming *Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice* will see DC’s two titans on the same screen, but never the twain shall meet. \n\nWhat might be less clear however, is why certain Marvel characters never seem to run into each other on the silver screen. The Avengers movie, and the solo adventures of all its constituent members (plus the <sc>S.H.I.E.L.D.</sc> TV show), are happening in one continuity. It’s fun to watch that universe grow, and look for cameos and references across the films, but to a fan of the comics it’s frustratingly obvious to see the film-makers run up against the limits of what they are permitted to show or even reference. Put simply, it’s a drag to know you’ll never see any two of Hulk, Wolverine and Spider-Man in the same frame. \n\nThe mystical force that keeps these universes separate is something more powerful than the Infinity Gauntlet, or the Tesseract, and far more insidious even than the Aether… it’s the immutable power of copyright law! Whilst Marvel owns all the rights to the use of its characters in print and on TV, the film rights are a different and more complicated story. Believe it or not there was a time in the distant and murky past (the 1990s) when superhero movies were not a permanent fixture of the box office. The Batman movies of the day were unsuccessful both as action films and in the camp comedy they reached for, and *Jurassic Park* (1993) and *Independence Day* (1996) set the templates for the summer blockbuster. It was in this climate that Marvel began selling movie rights to its characters. Spider-Man went to Sony, X-Men went to Fox, and both grew successful franchises out of what they had bought. So successful in fact that Marvel took the decision to begin producing their own films based on the properties they retained, beginning with *Iron Man* (2008). \n\nUnder the guidance of Avi Arad and Kevin Feige, the series of films that introduced Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, and then assembled them for *Marvel’s The Avengers* (2012) has become the [second highest-grossing film franchise in history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series). Now well into its ‘[Phase Two](http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/05/02/iron-man-3-marvel-phase-two/)’ and with releases allegedly [planned as far ahead as 2028](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/04/marvel-movie-masterplan-2028-president-kevin-feigle-comic-book) Marvel’s Cinematic Universe has become as reliable and regular a source of entertainment as the comics themselves.\n\nHowever, having struck deals for licensing out some of their most popular characters, Marvel—acquired by Disney in 2009—find themselves in a strange position: for all of the epic, dimension-hopping scale of their film series there remain some simple things they cannot do.

The result is a neat mosaic of some strikingly different personalities, all drawn to turn lenses on the city they call home. Enjoyable as these pieces are, it may have profited the film to have had some dialogue between the various practitioners: to find out what they each think about what makes the others tick. There’s enough for the viewer to piece together where their various interests overlap or diverge, but in holding to the format of presenting one photographer at a time a conversation never develops between them; it feels a little like we’re seeing the surface of a dozen lives at the expense of really coming to understand any one.</p>\n<p>If that seems uncharitable it is likely I was spoiled a little by 2010’s <em>Bill Cunningham, New York</em>: a remarkable documentary working similar territory, the magic of which comes when the film moves past Bill Cunningham as photographer and becomes interested in the man.

				"content_text": "I’m just done watching *Everybody Street*, a 2013 doc by Cheryl Dunn about the practice of street photography in general, and in particular the development of the artform over several decades in New York.\n\nDunn’s method is to present a series of photographers in turn, explore their methods, their motivations, and their work. The result is a neat mosaic of some strikingly different personalities, all drawn to turn lenses on the city they call home. Enjoyable as these pieces are, it may have profited the film to have had some dialogue between the various practitioners: to find out what they each think about what makes the others tick. There’s enough for the viewer to piece together where their various interests overlap or diverge, but in holding to the format of presenting one photographer at a time a conversation never develops between them; it feels a little like we’re seeing the surface of a dozen lives at the expense of really coming to understand any one.\n\nIf that seems uncharitable it is likely I was spoiled a little by 2010’s *Bill Cunningham, New York*: a remarkable documentary working similar territory, the magic of which comes when the film moves past Bill Cunningham as photographer and becomes interested in the man. If Dunn’s project here is solely to give an overview of New York street photography it is very well accomplished. That I came away with a list of names to look up, wanting to know more about some of the snappers than the film allows time for, can be read as either a positive or a negative.\n",

During my time wandering inside it a number of other works of art in various media came to mind: David Lynch is an obvious touchstone (perhaps particularly 2006’s <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>) for the tonal sense of magic hour dread; there is something akin to the feeling of being lost in the collapsing text of Danielewski’s byzantine novel <em>House of Leaves</em> (2000); some video games have begun to stretch into this off-kilter experiential realm, such as <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> (both 2013). Ultimately, however, this intricately constructed piece of immersive performance art is powerful in ways that those other media cannot approximate.</p>\n<p>The strength of theatre is the fact of it being live, happening before you within parameters of time and space which it creates for itself.

It does not take long for these simple things to radically alter one’s experience. To have become one of hundreds wearing an identical white visage, and to be tasked with nothing more than moving silently, is equal parts liberating and unsettling. This is the skewed starting point from which your journey branches - and no two will be alike.</p>\n<p>The experience of voyeurism is a powerfully odd thing. You might find yourself one of a handful of white masks in a hotel room, watching someone do their make-up. You may be alone in the diner, reading the menu or the pin-board full of notes by the telephone whilst the waitress polishes glasses, seemingly oblivious to your presence. It doesn’t take long to get used to being a ghost.</p>\n<p>One of the more Lynchian moments I witnessed was a dancer auditioning on a checkerboard stage. To her mind her audience is one seated individual who sits in a leather chair sipping from a tumbler. In fact, however, she is surrounded by more than a hundred of us, white masks lined up in silence and stillness not just in front of the stage but to the side, and even from the back.</p>\n<p>During my visit I was witness to a few of these set pieces. As you wander the labyrinthine sets you often catch sight of an unmasked face, or hear a voice around some corner and know that you have stumbled across some unfolding moment - a piece of the larger story. Many audience members tend to latch on to a character and follow them from scene to scene, perhaps switching to another character if the fancy takes them, all the the while shining a little more light on the arcs of these presented lives. Some of my favourite moments came in the wake of those scenes, after the audience had moved on - lingering in the empty section of set and examine its contents: read handwritten notes from one character to another, look through the press clippings a starlet has chosen to deface, peruse a collection of props neatly arranged and labelled in glass cabinets. Even wandering in this relatively aimless manner I came across a line dance, a drowning, an overdose… and many more. One of the few things I knew of the show before attending was to be wary of its scale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember there is always one more floor than you think there is. I thought it was quite an experience, and one with moments of real jaw-dropping wonder.</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/jul/19/punchrunk-hype-drowned-man-lyn-gardner\">Lyn Gardner</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a visitor you are quickly relieved of the idea that you will be able to take in all that <em>The Drowned Man</em> has to offer. I seemed to spend the first 45 minutes on a single floor, and even then without venturing into some of its corners. A cinema, a drug store, a bar, hotel rooms…. The moment of arriving to another floor and setting foot on sand for the first time was a small revelation to me: there were worlds contained here, and without intention or comprehension I had penetrated some barrier. It felt like this from one level to the next: from the soaring tress of the wood-chip floored forest to the depths of the basement with its heavy doors that close with an unsettling finality, leaving you in tiny rooms of authentic dankness, lone props on pedestals your only company.</p>\n<p>By virtue of its sheer size there are corners of these worlds that feel untouched - places you find yourself in alone. I had this experience in a room behind a curtain where a reel-to-reel tape intoned the voice of studio director Leland Stanford giving directions for what turned out to be a scene I would witness play out later on. Or at least, I believe it was later. The flow of time inside the world of the work seems disrupted. There are two stories playing out (at least, not to mention the innumerable, equally fascinating attendant narratives with which they touch), and your experience of them is dictated by your choice of how to move about the world Punchdrunk has created. “Tonight your bearing shapes your fate” as Stanford informs / warns you as you enter. You catch moments, run into characters, hear things in the distance wreathed in all of that fog, and you’re able to put some of it together. But what happened to whom and when, and why… these questions will likely remain unanswered when you emerge blinking into the London streets a few hours later feeling changed.</p>\n<p>Whilst it wears film as a badge of influence, the piece takes joy in the freedom of eschewing that medium’s conventions of sequential narrative structure. Even the most well-realised world of the novel cannot supply the sensory experience of wandering around unguided, immersed in a truly altered reality, at liberty to inspect any of its minutiae that you choose. The closest experience perhaps is to be found in the realm of video games, where narrative can move at the player’s pace and exploratory freedom is accepted as the determining factor of the world-building enterprise. Even then, however, efforts will always fall short of the incomparable fidelity of this masterfully realised performance space, and the immaculate work of the players within it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s about a heightened state of awareness.</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"http://youtu.be/6ktpes0qMZ0\">Felix Barrett</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I hadn’t been convinced of the work’s singular brilliance by the <em>sui generis</em> experience of wandering within <em>The Drowned Man</em> as a whole, I most certainly was by one moment in particular. At one point I found myself at the back of a large group of white masks looking on as a dance number was filmed on one of the studio’s sets. I could hardly see anything and resorted to waiting in a hallway to see how the crowd would disperse. As I did so the character of The Seamstress walked past me and disappeared into a nearby doorway.  Provoked by curiosity, and secure in my status as a phantom, I followed and found her attending to racks of costumes in the studio’s wardrobe department. I took to examining the room and was poking at shelves filled with shoes when she approached, looked me straight in the eye, and held out her hand. I had been a ghost for 90 minutes by this time, and this simple gesture so completely altered my perception of the role I was playing within the world of the performance that it took a few seconds and a raise of her eyebrows before I comprehended what was being asked of me. Taking The Seamstress’s hand I was led to a dressing room, the door to which she quickly locked behind us. Once we were alone she spoke to me, instructing me to sit, then to come closer, and then telling me that she was going to get me ready for my “next big scene”. She performed another simple action that again had the effect of changing my whole experience: she removed my mask and set it aside as she began to tell me what was needed - “a little to the eyes, something to the lips”. She took up a pinch of some substance from the make-up tray and began to rub it into my lips, all the time telling me that I reminded her of someone: of “the first painted queen”. Adding dabs of something black to the corners of my eyes she told me how people had said the queen had “promise in her lips, or poison”, and taking hold of my face she told me “but you know which it is don’t you?”. As whatever she had rubbed into my lips began to warm and tingle, The Seamstress turned my head so that I saw myself in the mirror for the first time, and as I did so the image changed revealing a face made of twigs.</p>\n<p>These few minutes, behind a locked door, revealed to me the power of Punchdrunk’s art. The timing of it, how the music was made to crescendo at the correct moment, and how the special effect was triggered are parts of a mystery I have little interest in solving. The experience, to be that close to a performance, to be the only one being performed to, and what’s more to remain utterly convinced of it—to find not a hint of a crack in the artifice—was absolutely unlike any other interaction I have ever had with a work of art, and nothing short of astounding.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I haven’t been willing or able to put <em>The Drowned Man</em> out of my head since seeing it, and my post-show experience is characterised by contradictions. Many of the sets were so beautifully constructed and so richly detailed that I longed to be able to capture some of the images; at the same time, however, I’m keenly aware that the experience would have been greatly diminished by the permission to do so. Hundreds of ghosts with camera-phones would quickly dispel the show’s magical atmosphere. Similarly I am compelled by the concept of recreating that world, its characters and rhythms, in the form of a digital replica in which I would have unlimited time to walk around and make new discoveries. Yet, conversely, I’m in love with the mystery of the piece; the very fact of my experience’s incompleteness has a powerful romantic pull.</p>\n<p>A few more hours in that awe inspiring place couldn’t hurt, however, and if the <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/plans-to-extend-punchdrunks-drowned-man-to-end-of-2014\">planned extension of the run</a> goes ahead, I’ll certainly want to revisit Temple Studios.</p>\n",

Even the most well-realised world of the novel cannot supply the sensory experience of wandering around unguided, immersed in a truly altered reality, at liberty to inspect any of its minutiae that you choose. The closest experience perhaps is to be found in the realm of video games, where narrative can move at the player’s pace and exploratory freedom is accepted as the determining factor of the world-building enterprise. Even then, however, efforts will always fall short of the incomparable fidelity of this masterfully realised performance space, and the immaculate work of the players within it. \n\n> It’s about a heightened state of awareness. \n>  \n> — [Felix Barrett](http://youtu.be/6ktpes0qMZ0)\n\nIf I hadn’t been convinced of the work’s singular brilliance by the *sui generis* experience of wandering within *The Drowned Man* as a whole, I most certainly was by one moment in particular. At one point I found myself at the back of a large group of white masks looking on as a dance number was filmed on one of the studio’s sets. I could hardly see anything and resorted to waiting in a hallway to see how the crowd would disperse. As I did so the character of The Seamstress walked past me and disappeared into a nearby doorway.  Provoked by curiosity, and secure in my status as a phantom, I followed and found her attending to racks of costumes in the studio’s wardrobe department. I took to examining the room and was poking at shelves filled with shoes when she approached, looked me straight in the eye, and held out her hand. I had been a ghost for 90 minutes by this time, and this simple gesture so completely altered my perception of the role I was playing within the world of the performance that it took a few seconds and a raise of her eyebrows before I comprehended what was being asked of me. Taking The Seamstress’s hand I was led to a dressing room, the door to which she quickly locked behind us. Once we were alone she spoke to me, instructing me to sit, then to come closer, and then telling me that she was going to get me ready for my “next big scene”. She performed another simple action that again had the effect of changing my whole experience: she removed my mask and set it aside as she began to tell me what was needed - “a little to the eyes, something to the lips”. She took up a pinch of some substance from the make-up tray and began to rub it into my lips, all the time telling me that I reminded her of someone: of “the first painted queen”. Adding dabs of something black to the corners of my eyes she told me how people had said the queen had “promise in her lips, or poison”, and taking hold of my face she told me “but you know which it is don’t you?”. As whatever she had rubbed into my lips began to warm and tingle, The Seamstress turned my head so that I saw myself in the mirror for the first time, and as I did so the image changed revealing a face made of twigs. \n\nThese few minutes, behind a locked door, revealed to me the power of Punchdrunk’s art. The timing of it, how the music was made to crescendo at the correct moment, and how the special effect was triggered are parts of a mystery I have little interest in solving. The experience, to be that close to a performance, to be the only one being performed to, and what’s more to remain utterly convinced of it—to find not a hint of a crack in the artifice—was absolutely unlike any other interaction I have ever had with a work of art, and nothing short of astounding.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\nI haven’t been willing or able to put *The Drowned Man* out of my head since seeing it, and my post-show experience is characterised by contradictions. Many of the sets were so beautifully constructed and so richly detailed that I longed to be able to capture some of the images; at the same time, however, I’m keenly aware that the experience would have been greatly diminished by the permission to do so. Hundreds of ghosts with camera-phones would quickly dispel the show’s magical atmosphere. Similarly I am compelled by the concept of recreating that world, its characters and rhythms, in the form of a digital replica in which I would have unlimited time to walk around and make new discoveries. Yet, conversely, I’m in love with the mystery of the piece; the very fact of my experience’s incompleteness has a powerful romantic pull.\n\nA few more hours in that awe inspiring place couldn’t hurt, however, and if the [planned extension of the run](https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/plans-to-extend-punchdrunks-drowned-man-to-end-of-2014) goes ahead, I’ll certainly want to revisit Temple Studios.\n",

				"title": "The List 2013",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-roly-porter--life-cycle-of-a-massive-star\">20. Roly Porter — <em>Life Cycle of a Massive Star</em></h3>\n<p>I listened to and loved a lot of electronic music this year, from danceable stuff like Gesaffelstein’s <em>Aleph</em> and Four Tet’s <em>Beautiful Rewind</em> down to more experimental work like this. Porter’s ~35 minute album is a musical exploration of how a celestial body forms, exists, and decays; it’s probably best considered a single piece of music and it’s for this reason that a pretty incredible album is so low on the list: I just haven’t managed to sit down and listen to it start-to-finish more than a couple of times. When I have though, particularly through good headphones, it’s stunning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-pantha-du-prince--the-bell-laboratory--elements-of-light\">19. Pantha du Prince &amp; The Bell Laboratory — <em>Elements of Light</em></h3>\n<p>Another relatively short electronic album with a physics-based title. <em>Elements of Light</em> is more easily digestible than Porter’s record, and is based around a fascinating interplay between minimal electronica and a whole suite of bells played by the Norwegian ensemble The Bell Laboratory. This came out all the way back in January and must be one of my most listened to albums of 2013, but the way these two constituent elements play around and interact with each other never got tired for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-surfer-blood--pythons\">18. Surfer Blood — <em>Pythons</em></h3>\n<p>Hark! Guitars! And what a joyful racket Surfer Blood make on their second LP. To my ear this recalls mid-90s Weezer crossed with just a touch of something from the millennial New York scene of The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs etc. There’s nothing surprising here if you listened to their first album (and EP) as many times as I did, but there is so much to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. A dozen three-minute pop gems that vary in emotional tonality around the same bases as all my favourite emo / bubblegum bands of the past (shout out to That Dog!). Surfer Blood’s secret weapon, it should be noted, is John Paul Pitts’s voice: unusually tuneful and rich, but also capable of a Frank Black-esque scream if required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-shigeto--no-better-time-than-now\">17. Shigeto — <em>No Better Time Than Now</em></h3>\n<p>I came to Shigeto via a project by photographer Tim Navis in which several artists across various disciplines (video, photography, music&hellip;) took a trip to and around Iceland capturing their thoughts and experiences. That was enough to put this guy on my radar, and when Ghostly International put out this album - an immaculate set of spacious and contemplative electronica with some jazz influences - in August I was all over it. It’s been spinning regularly ever since.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-jon-hopkins--immunity\">16. Jon Hopkins — <em>Immunity</em></h3>\n<p>A blend of dance and more avant-garde melodic composition, <em>Immunity</em> is a very difficult album to categorise. In places it’s quite trancy and heavy, and then it’ll break for a meditative interlude and allow piano notes to linger amid a weighted silence. After dozens of listens I can’t entirely work out how such dramatic shifts are made to feel like a whole piece, but this remains one of the albums I’d recommend if someone was looking for an instrumental record from 2013.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-local-natives--hummingbird\">15. Local Natives — <em>Hummingbird</em></h3>\n<p>To my mind the sound of Local Natives is centred on Taylor Rice’s vocals: there’s a quiet melancholy there that sets the pace, and then thoughtful, spacious composition, and not- too-warm production paint the rest of the picture. There are some wonderfully emotive moments such as the quietly heartbreaking refrain of “you gave, and gave, and gave, and gave” in ‘Colombia’ that really struck a true chord for me, and tracks like ‘Ceilings’ that felt like perfect walking around music in spring and then again in autumn. A new band to me, I’ll be keeping an eye out for what follows next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-queens-of-the-stone-age--like-clockwork\">14. Queens of the Stone Age — <em>&hellip;Like Clockwork</em></h3>\n<p>It was immediately apparent to me, only a couple of tracks into my first listen, that this was the QotSA album I’d been waiting for since 2002. I’m not sure how, but Homme et al have managed to recapture pretty near all the magic that seemed to have ebbed away over the last decade, and perhaps even more perplexingly, they make it sound effortless. At their best Queens combine a sense of genuine menace and darkness with an irresistibly catchy edge. Often that dichotomy is presented in an even split between guitars and the rhythm section respectively, with Homme’s incomparable vocals snaking their way somewhere through the middle ground. They don’t really put a foot wrong across these 10 tracks and it feels great to have them back at full strength.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-mikal-cronin--mcii\">13. Mikal Cronin — <em>MCII</em></h3>\n<p>I didn’t know Mikal Cronin at the start of the year and tuned into this album on the strength of a great review I happened across upon its release in May. Not wishing to be reductive but this record fit perfectly into the gap left by the absence of a Ben Kweller album this year. It is built of the same stuff (pop-rock roots, folk-leanings, garage rock with a seriously melodic underpinning) and executed with the same verve, energy, and colour. There’s nothing too complex here, Cronin wears his heart on his sleeve musically, and has made an album that you feel like you’re intimately familiar with by about the third listen through.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-paramore--paramore\">12. Paramore — <em>Paramore</em></h3>\n<p>It’s no surprise that I have a soft spot for Paramore - they’re hitting a lot of the emo buttons I have wired up from years of listening to Jimmy Eat World and Jenny Lewis, whilst at the same time crafting huge singalong pop-rock that the Biffy Clyro / Foo Fighters listening part of me is still in love with. At 17 tracks this album is perhaps a little overlong considering the breadth of what is on offer, but I’ve played it a lot and the majority of it is pretty great. ‘Still Into You’ is unashamedly on the shortlist for songs of the year because at heart I’m a 15 year old girl.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-holden--the-inheritors\">11. Holden — <em>The Inheritors</em></h3>\n<p>This set of endlessly inventive electronica ranges from complex &amp; heavy rhythms to lighter and more playful fare that recalls chiptune artists like Disasterpeace. James Holden can get pretty far out there, and his use of glitch and dissonance on some tracks makes for an uneven, if consistently interesting, listening experience. Not everything here is easy to love, but I’ve found myself being drawn in more and more over repeated listens. Once I felt I could trust Holden to make smart choices in his composition I started to really get into a lot of what is on offer here. If you can give yourself over to it, it’s an enormously rewarding record.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-dawn-of-midi--dysnomia\">10. Dawn of Midi — <em>Dysnomia</em></h3>\n<p>I feel bad for Roly Porter down there in 20th, my reasoning having been that I hadn’t found the time to listen to his LP in its entirety on enough occasions. I found that time for <em>Dysnomia</em>, partly because I came to the record earlier in the year, but also because it absolutely floored me on first listen. I was introduced to this band and this album by an episode of the Radiolab podcast and the ideas clicked with me: musical improvisation as a competitive artform; Aphex Twin and trance as rhythmic progenitors; the incremental development of a new style that brings the cold precision of computer-generated electronica through the warming filter of human players and acoustic instruments. The closest touchstone in my listening experience is probably The Necks, but this album feels tighter and more sparse in a way I find completely captivating. Dawn of Midi do an awful lot with comparatively little here, and I just can’t get enough of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-atoms-for-peace--amok\">9. Atoms for Peace — <em>AMOK</em></h3>\n<p>I don’t need to waste words here explaining how central Thom Yorke has been to my musical life since the mid-90s. What does need to be said, for fear of it being taken for granted, is how ceaselessly inquisitive he is as a musician. This latest dispatch seems to be an offshoot of the <em>Eraser</em> / <em>King of Limbs</em> branch (no pun intended) but has more than enough to it to also feel new and vital. Nothing feels like a retread, perhaps because Yorke is smart enough to surround himself with world-class musicians and do exactly what they collectively intend without compromise. I do feel that it’s easy to accept brilliance as a given from Yorke, and that threatens to obscure the achievement - I’ve loved listening to this album all year and I remain super-excited to learn what comes next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-tegan--sara--heartthrob\">8. Tegan &amp; Sara — <em>Heartthrob</em></h3>\n<p>I was disappointed in this record at first. 2004’s <em>So Jealous</em> remains my favourite T&amp;S album, and it’s taken some effort of will to contend with the reality that with each subsequent release they’re moving in a different direction. <em>Sainthood</em> (2009) took me some time to adjust to, and the jump to <em>Heartthrob</em> (perhaps evidenced in the four-year wait) felt even greater to me. The Quins sound like almost entirely different musicians from three albums ago, and that’s something to celebrate and marvel at. It’s not quite a Madonna-style wholesale reinvention but something more organic, the thread of which can now be traced back through <em>Sainthood</em> and <em>The Con</em> (2007). Of course, until the next album <em>Heartthrob</em> feels like the destination rather than another point on a continuum, but through repeated listening I gradually fell for the evolution represented on this record. I can’t resist chanting along with ‘Shock to Your System’, and the opening couplets of ‘I Was a Fool’ are capable of bringing a tear to my eye.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-emptyset--recur\">7. Emptyset — <em>Recur</em></h3>\n<p>Not wishing to place too much importance on categories, electronic music of various stripes was huge for me in 2013, and <em>Recur</em> quickly materialised as the zenith of that when it was released in October. There’s a great balance on this album of slowly building - via loops, modular tones, white-noise patterns etc. - and surprising the listener with some new element. The titular recursion is both rhythmic and thematic, and provides the album’s spine. On to that are grafted some of the most sonically interesting and exciting pieces of techno / noise / sound collage I found this year. As I’ve begun to explore some of the topography of electronica it has, naturally, been a process of learning where my tastes lie. Of all the records from that world that I heard this year <em>Recur</em> cascaded more dopamine into my system than any other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-haim--days-are-gone\">6. HAIM — <em>Days Are Gone</em></h3>\n<p>The debut album from these three Californian sisters (+ non-sibling drummer) is ridiculously catchy and possessed of a self-assurance in exactly what it is, which makes it pretty much irresistible. Part Fleetwood Mac, part 80s pop, part neon-lit dance, and soulful at the same time there’s is a lot to love here - especially since the mix doesn’t feel forced and doesn’t take any effort to listen to or learn, hum or sing along to. Songs such as album highlight ‘If I Could Change Your Mind’, Springsteen-esque ‘Don’t Save Me’, and the title track reveal a mature sense for songwriting and an emotional range that marks HAIM out from many of the poppier records I heard this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-kanye-west--yeezus\">5. Kanye West — <em>Yeezus</em></h3>\n<p>It still bugs me that I didn’t pick up Kanye’s previous album (<em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> (2010)) in the year of release; it would easily have been up there on the list. I had liked but not loved the first couple of albums, and been left cold by 2008’s <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak</em>, but when I finally got around to listening to <em>MBDTF</em> it felt like the fulfilment of a promise. There’s little dispute about the fact that West is at the height of his powers right now, and <em>Yeezus</em> is unequivocally the product of an artist feeling completely unrestrained to create. The production alone here is flat-out stunning from first to last, sounding like nothing else I’ve heard. There are missteps (I’m not convinced Nina Simone’s ‘Strange Fruit’ is properly repurposed on ‘Blood on the Leaves’), and the album sags a bit in the middle, but nothing hit harder in 2013 than the first four tracks of this record. In terms of personality Kanye is hard to like, and some of the content is unsavoury, but it’s impossible to deny the artistry on display.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-chvrches--the-bones-of-what-you-believe\">4. Chvrches — <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em></h3>\n<p>To my mind this record is the pinnacle of what pop music produced this year. It fills the same role for me as Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em> did in 2010 and Metric’s <em>Synthetica</em> last year: a meticulously crafted, brightly coloured blast of exuberant synth and singalong choruses. It’s not quite as flawless as the latter of those, but it is nevertheless an outstanding 50 minutes of polished, indelible songs, pretty much all of which are guaranteed to stick firmly in my head for hours and hours after listening. Not life changing perhaps, but thoroughly life-affirming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-biffy-clyro--opposites\">3. Biffy Clyro — <em>Opposites</em></h3>\n<p>I was skeptical that Biffy Clyro would be able to follow 2007’s <em>Puzzle</em> with anything that hit me as hard, and somehow they bottled lightning and produced a genuinely incredible next step in <em>Only Revolutions</em> (2009). How do you follow those two? Apparently you make a record as big as both of them combined, reaching further in both directions - esoterica and radio anthem - than before, and leave pretty much everyone else looking like they’re not trying.</p>\n<p>It took a long time for me to digest <em>Opposites</em>. I was so excited to hear it that as soon as it was released I had it on repeat and found myself dismayed that I wasn&rsquo;t keying into many of the tracks. I find that most Biffy songs lure you in with a seeming familiarity (of structure, of chord progression, of percussion) but are just off-kilter enough to ask the listener to do some of the work and meet them part-way. Listening to the entire album in whole gulps wasn’t doing it, and I had to break it up into two pieces and almost treat it as two separate albums. Then the rewards started flowing thick and fast: one giant-sized, super-powered anthem after another made its home in my head.</p>\n<p>This album has been a near-constant presence throughout the year, and has survived since January to claim a place in the top 5 without any real doubt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-manic-street-preachers--rewind-the-film\">2. Manic Street Preachers — <em>Rewind the Film</em></h3>\n<p>This year I saw Soundgarden play Brixton Academy. The material from their early-to- mid-90s heyday sounded great and the newer stuff sounded like they still want to be that same band (and aren’t quite capable of it). Here, on the other hand, is the 11th studio album from a band that have been together for more than two decades, and it’s a record that feels entirely at home in its skin. This year’s Pearl Jam album displays a similar understanding of how the musicians and the band’s place within the musical landscape has evolved, but the returns are lesser. What the Manics have achieved with <em>Rewind the Film</em> is very impressive indeed: a thoughtful, mature album that foregrounds the intelligence that their music has always possessed and doesn’t balk from examining the deeply unsexy subjects of middle age, depression, and Conservative Britain. As a document of a band’s continued mastery of their form it’s exceptional.</p>\n<p>Some of that same confidence is also present in the decisions to stick almost entirely to acoustic instrumentation, and to let guest vocalists lead some of the album’s best songs. The interplay between Bradfield and Lucy Rose on opener ‘This Sullen Welsh Heart’ is inspired, and Richard Hawley’s performance on the title track is simply incredible.</p>\n<p>This album was conceived as the first half of a two-album set, alongside the forthcoming <em>Futurology</em> (described as the next step on the path of <em>The Holy Bible</em> (1994) and <em>Journal for Plague Lovers</em> (2009)). I couldn’t be more excited to find out what the other half of the Manics’ sound has evolved into.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-arcade-fire--reflektor\">1. Arcade Fire — <em>Reflektor</em></h3>\n<p>There are many elements to my relationship with this record that echo my comments on Biffy Clyro’s: a double album the arrival of which had me wondering how it could possibly follow what came before, it also initially proved too large for me to parse as a single artefact. As with <em>Opposites</em>, breaking it in two bore fruit and it didn’t take long for me to fall for each piece of music, one-by-one. The genuine revelation, however, came when I was then able to recombine the constituent pieces into a whole, and follow the album’s many threads as they appear, disappear, reappear, and reflect over songs that feel at once entirely at home in the Arcade Fire catalogue and yet in many respects very new.</p>\n<p>Each AF album feels so stylistically of-a-piece to me: <em>Funeral</em> is modest and even-tempered; <em>Neon Bible</em> showier and more sharply critical; <em>The Suburbs</em> a balanced maturation and expansion of <em>Funeral&rsquo;s</em> themes of home &amp; family etc. It seem to me that <em>Reflektor</em> is closer to <em>Neon Bible</em>: like that album it’s in some manner a conceptual statement, here repeatedly returning to the subject of modern relationships. The explorations it makes on its themes are nuanced, insightful, and never stray into heavy-handed cliché - there are few bands reporting the modern experience to us with this degree of authenticity and artistry. Arcade Fire are operating on a new level with <em>Reflektor</em>, and are quite possibly the only ones inhabiting it.</p>\n<p>This is Arcade Fire’s fourth appearance at the top of my yearly list, and it was earned on merit. Already my favourite contemporary musical artists, I remain awed by what they are capable of.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Roly Porter — *Life Cycle of a Massive Star* \n\nI listened to and loved a lot of electronic music this year, from danceable stuff like Gesaffelstein’s *Aleph* and Four Tet’s *Beautiful Rewind* down to more experimental work like this. Porter’s ~35 minute album is a musical exploration of how a celestial body forms, exists, and decays; it’s probably best considered a single piece of music and it’s for this reason that a pretty incredible album is so low on the list: I just haven’t managed to sit down and listen to it start-to-finish more than a couple of times. When I have though, particularly through good headphones, it’s stunning.\n \n###  19. Pantha du Prince & The Bell Laboratory — *Elements of Light* \n\nAnother relatively short electronic album with a physics-based title. *Elements of Light* is more easily digestible than Porter’s record, and is based around a fascinating interplay between minimal electronica and a whole suite of bells played by the Norwegian ensemble The Bell Laboratory. This came out all the way back in January and must be one of my most listened to albums of 2013, but the way these two constituent elements play around and interact with each other never got tired for me.\n\n###  18. Surfer Blood — *Pythons* \n\nHark! Guitars! And what a joyful racket Surfer Blood make on their second LP. To my ear this recalls mid-90s Weezer crossed with just a touch of something from the millennial New York scene of The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs etc. There’s nothing surprising here if you listened to their first album (and EP) as many times as I did, but there is so much to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. A dozen three-minute pop gems that vary in emotional tonality around the same bases as all my favourite emo / bubblegum bands of the past (shout out to That Dog!). Surfer Blood’s secret weapon, it should be noted, is John Paul Pitts’s voice: unusually tuneful and rich, but also capable of a Frank Black-esque scream if required.\n \n###  17. Shigeto — *No Better Time Than Now* \n\nI came to Shigeto via a project by photographer Tim Navis in which several artists across various disciplines (video, photography, music...) took a trip to and around Iceland capturing their thoughts and experiences. That was enough to put this guy on my radar, and when Ghostly International put out this album - an immaculate set of spacious and contemplative electronica with some jazz influences - in August I was all over it. It’s been spinning regularly ever since.\n\n###  16. Jon Hopkins — *Immunity* \n\nA blend of dance and more avant-garde melodic composition, *Immunity* is a very difficult album to categorise. In places it’s quite trancy and heavy, and then it’ll break for a meditative interlude and allow piano notes to linger amid a weighted silence. After dozens of listens I can’t entirely work out how such dramatic shifts are made to feel like a whole piece, but this remains one of the albums I’d recommend if someone was looking for an instrumental record from 2013.\n\n###  15. Local Natives — *Hummingbird* \n\nTo my mind the sound of Local Natives is centred on Taylor Rice’s vocals: there’s a quiet melancholy there that sets the pace, and then thoughtful, spacious composition, and not- too-warm production paint the rest of the picture. There are some wonderfully emotive moments such as the quietly heartbreaking refrain of “you gave, and gave, and gave, and gave” in ‘Colombia’ that really struck a true chord for me, and tracks like ‘Ceilings’ that felt like perfect walking around music in spring and then again in autumn. A new band to me, I’ll be keeping an eye out for what follows next.\n \n###  14. Queens of the Stone Age — *...Like Clockwork* \n\nIt was immediately apparent to me, only a couple of tracks into my first listen, that this was the QotSA album I’d been waiting for since 2002. I’m not sure how, but Homme et al have managed to recapture pretty near all the magic that seemed to have ebbed away over the last decade, and perhaps even more perplexingly, they make it sound effortless. At their best Queens combine a sense of genuine menace and darkness with an irresistibly catchy edge. Often that dichotomy is presented in an even split between guitars and the rhythm section respectively, with Homme’s incomparable vocals snaking their way somewhere through the middle ground. They don’t really put a foot wrong across these 10 tracks and it feels great to have them back at full strength.\n \n###  13. Mikal Cronin — *MCII* \n \nI didn’t know Mikal Cronin at the start of the year and tuned into this album on the strength of a great review I happened across upon its release in May. Not wishing to be reductive but this record fit perfectly into the gap left by the absence of a Ben Kweller album this year. It is built of the same stuff (pop-rock roots, folk-leanings, garage rock with a seriously melodic underpinning) and executed with the same verve, energy, and colour. There’s nothing too complex here, Cronin wears his heart on his sleeve musically, and has made an album that you feel like you’re intimately familiar with by about the third listen through.\n\n###  12. Paramore — *Paramore* \n\nIt’s no surprise that I have a soft spot for Paramore - they’re hitting a lot of the emo buttons I have wired up from years of listening to Jimmy Eat World and Jenny Lewis, whilst at the same time crafting huge singalong pop-rock that the Biffy Clyro / Foo Fighters listening part of me is still in love with. At 17 tracks this album is perhaps a little overlong considering the breadth of what is on offer, but I’ve played it a lot and the majority of it is pretty great. ‘Still Into You’ is unashamedly on the shortlist for songs of the year because at heart I’m a 15 year old girl.\n\n###  11. Holden — *The Inheritors* \n\nThis set of endlessly inventive electronica ranges from complex & heavy rhythms to lighter and more playful fare that recalls chiptune artists like Disasterpeace. James Holden can get pretty far out there, and his use of glitch and dissonance on some tracks makes for an uneven, if consistently interesting, listening experience. Not everything here is easy to love, but I’ve found myself being drawn in more and more over repeated listens. Once I felt I could trust Holden to make smart choices in his composition I started to really get into a lot of what is on offer here. If you can give yourself over to it, it’s an enormously rewarding record.\n\n###  10. Dawn of Midi — *Dysnomia* \n \nI feel bad for Roly Porter down there in 20th, my reasoning having been that I hadn’t found the time to listen to his LP in its entirety on enough occasions. I found that time for *Dysnomia*, partly because I came to the record earlier in the year, but also because it absolutely floored me on first listen. I was introduced to this band and this album by an episode of the Radiolab podcast and the ideas clicked with me: musical improvisation as a competitive artform; Aphex Twin and trance as rhythmic progenitors; the incremental development of a new style that brings the cold precision of computer-generated electronica through the warming filter of human players and acoustic instruments. The closest touchstone in my listening experience is probably The Necks, but this album feels tighter and more sparse in a way I find completely captivating. Dawn of Midi do an awful lot with comparatively little here, and I just can’t get enough of it.\n \n###  9. Atoms for Peace — *AMOK* \n\nI don’t need to waste words here explaining how central Thom Yorke has been to my musical life since the mid-90s. What does need to be said, for fear of it being taken for granted, is how ceaselessly inquisitive he is as a musician. This latest dispatch seems to be an offshoot of the *Eraser* / *King of Limbs* branch (no pun intended) but has more than enough to it to also feel new and vital. Nothing feels like a retread, perhaps because Yorke is smart enough to surround himself with world-class musicians and do exactly what they collectively intend without compromise. I do feel that it’s easy to accept brilliance as a given from Yorke, and that threatens to obscure the achievement - I’ve loved listening to this album all year and I remain super-excited to learn what comes next.\n \n###  8. Tegan & Sara — *Heartthrob* \n\nI was disappointed in this record at first. 2004’s *So Jealous* remains my favourite T&S album, and it’s taken some effort of will to contend with the reality that with each subsequent release they’re moving in a different direction. *Sainthood* (2009) took me some time to adjust to, and the jump to *Heartthrob* (perhaps evidenced in the four-year wait) felt even greater to me. The Quins sound like almost entirely different musicians from three albums ago, and that’s something to celebrate and marvel at. It’s not quite a Madonna-style wholesale reinvention but something more organic, the thread of which can now be traced back through *Sainthood* and *The Con* (2007). Of course, until the next album *Heartthrob* feels like the destination rather than another point on a continuum, but through repeated listening I gradually fell for the evolution represented on this record. I can’t resist chanting along with ‘Shock to Your System’, and the opening couplets of ‘I Was a Fool’ are capable of bringing a tear to my eye.\n\n###  7. Emptyset — *Recur* \n \nNot wishing to place too much importance on categories, electronic music of various stripes was huge for me in 2013, and *Recur* quickly materialised as the zenith of that when it was released in October. There’s a great balance on this album of slowly building - via loops, modular tones, white-noise patterns etc. - and surprising the listener with some new element. The titular recursion is both rhythmic and thematic, and provides the album’s spine. On to that are grafted some of the most sonically interesting and exciting pieces of techno / noise / sound collage I found this year. As I’ve begun to explore some of the topography of electronica it has, naturally, been a process of learning where my tastes lie. Of all the records from that world that I heard this year *Recur* cascaded more dopamine into my system than any other.\n \n###  6. HAIM — *Days Are Gone* \n\nThe debut album from these three Californian sisters (+ non-sibling drummer) is ridiculously catchy and possessed of a self-assurance in exactly what it is, which makes it pretty much irresistible. Part Fleetwood Mac, part 80s pop, part neon-lit dance, and soulful at the same time there’s is a lot to love here - especially since the mix doesn’t feel forced and doesn’t take any effort to listen to or learn, hum or sing along to. Songs such as album highlight ‘If I Could Change Your Mind’, Springsteen-esque ‘Don’t Save Me’, and the title track reveal a mature sense for songwriting and an emotional range that marks HAIM out from many of the poppier records I heard this year.\n \n###  5. Kanye West — *Yeezus* \n\nIt still bugs me that I didn’t pick up Kanye’s previous album (*My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* (2010)) in the year of release; it would easily have been up there on the list. I had liked but not loved the first couple of albums, and been left cold by 2008’s *808s & Heartbreak*, but when I finally got around to listening to *MBDTF* it felt like the fulfilment of a promise. There’s little dispute about the fact that West is at the height of his powers right now, and *Yeezus* is unequivocally the product of an artist feeling completely unrestrained to create. The production alone here is flat-out stunning from first to last, sounding like nothing else I’ve heard. There are missteps (I’m not convinced Nina Simone’s ‘Strange Fruit’ is properly repurposed on ‘Blood on the Leaves’), and the album sags a bit in the middle, but nothing hit harder in 2013 than the first four tracks of this record. In terms of personality Kanye is hard to like, and some of the content is unsavoury, but it’s impossible to deny the artistry on display.\n \n###  4. Chvrches — *The Bones of What You Believe* \n\nTo my mind this record is the pinnacle of what pop music produced this year. It fills the same role for me as Robyn’s *Body Talk* did in 2010 and Metric’s *Synthetica* last year: a meticulously crafted, brightly coloured blast of exuberant synth and singalong choruses. It’s not quite as flawless as the latter of those, but it is nevertheless an outstanding 50 minutes of polished, indelible songs, pretty much all of which are guaranteed to stick firmly in my head for hours and hours after listening.

Biffy Clyro — *Opposites* \n\nI was skeptical that Biffy Clyro would be able to follow 2007’s *Puzzle* with anything that hit me as hard, and somehow they bottled lightning and produced a genuinely incredible next step in *Only Revolutions* (2009). How do you follow those two? Apparently you make a record as big as both of them combined, reaching further in both directions - esoterica and radio anthem - than before, and leave pretty much everyone else looking like they’re not trying.\n\nIt took a long time for me to digest *Opposites*. I was so excited to hear it that as soon as it was released I had it on repeat and found myself dismayed that I wasn't keying into many of the tracks. I find that most Biffy songs lure you in with a seeming familiarity (of structure, of chord progression, of percussion) but are just off-kilter enough to ask the listener to do some of the work and meet them part-way. Listening to the entire album in whole gulps wasn’t doing it, and I had to break it up into two pieces and almost treat it as two separate albums. Then the rewards started flowing thick and fast: one giant-sized, super-powered anthem after another made its home in my head.\n\nThis album has been a near-constant presence throughout the year, and has survived since January to claim a place in the top 5 without any real doubt.\n \n###  2.

I couldn’t be more excited to find out what the other half of the Manics’ sound has evolved into.\n \n###  1. Arcade Fire — *Reflektor* \n\nThere are many elements to my relationship with this record that echo my comments on Biffy Clyro’s: a double album the arrival of which had me wondering how it could possibly follow what came before, it also initially proved too large for me to parse as a single artefact. As with *Opposites*, breaking it in two bore fruit and it didn’t take long for me to fall for each piece of music, one-by-one. The genuine revelation, however, came when I was then able to recombine the constituent pieces into a whole, and follow the album’s many threads as they appear, disappear, reappear, and reflect over songs that feel at once entirely at home in the Arcade Fire catalogue and yet in many respects very new.\n\nEach AF album feels so stylistically of-a-piece to me: *Funeral* is modest and even-tempered; *Neon Bible* showier and more sharply critical; *The Suburbs* a balanced maturation and expansion of *Funeral's* themes of home & family etc. It seem to me that *Reflektor* is closer to *Neon Bible*: like that album it’s in some manner a conceptual statement, here repeatedly returning to the subject of modern relationships.

				"content_html": "<p>For as long as I can recall I’ve had a propensity for starting more books than I finish, and for having more books in progress than I could sensibly manage at once. With other long-form media I tend to be fairly faithful to one offering at a time: I rarely have more than one narrative video game in progress, and whilst Elizabeth and I are adherents of the box-set as a manner of watching television we tend to stick to one show at a time. With books, however, I tend to wander.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it comes from having spent five years as a literature student. In that time I was bound to a relatively strict reading regimen, within which texts were selected for me and had to be finished by a certain date. Fruitful seminar discussion, the delivering of presentations, and the writing of essay papers all depended on the timely completion of reading assignments, and whilst reading around the subject was encouraged, there was nevertheless a very definite structure of what to read and when to read it.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there was another element to literary study that wasn’t all rigorous working to a reading list. Particularly within my postgraduate study the research and composition of longer critical pieces called for the development of a certain set of skills: the ability to parse information from multiple, diverse sources and draw parallels and comparisons between them whilst building a coherent argument of one’s own. I loved this part - the collecting of tangentially related texts, coming to a greater understanding of how the art and the arguments hung together. Paintings mentioned in poems that were referred to in journal articles about novels. I can see some of that reflected in my natural inclination to start one book and then reach for another. Before leaving for New York recently I decided to (re-)read some novels set in the city. I managed Teju Cole’s <em>Open City</em>, about half of Adelle Waldman’s <em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.</em>, 30 pages of Paul Auster’s <em>New York Trilogy</em>, and part of DeLillo’s <em>Falling Man</em>… the rest of the time was spent reading sections of Leo Hollis’s <em>Cities are Good For You</em>, and dipping into Ann Beattie’s <em>New Yorker Stories</em>. One book sparked off an interest in another, and reading each opened a new window onto the ones that came before and after.</p>\n<p>In-and-of-itself this kind of scattershot approach to text selection is not an inherently bad thing; the only real shame of it is that I manage to see so few books through to the end. I have lost track of the number of novels, non-fiction books, and collections of short stories I have started in the last year, but I would guess that the number I have completed is in single digits. Reading for pleasure - or perhaps I should say ‘casual reading’, since reading for class was often also pleasurable - can (and perhaps should) be approached with a different mindset to reading for study. With no goal other than the completion of the text perhaps there is an argument to be made for giving oneself over to the book at hand and expending less energy on trying to understand its place within the larger literary universe. I’ve decided to put this idea to the test by resolving to read just one book at a time for a while. I think it might be interesting to see how my reading habits change, and whether I get something different from the texts when they’re read in isolation.</p>\n<p>To test my newfound resolve the first novel I’ve decided upon is Haruki Murakami’s three-volume, 928-page opus <em>1Q84</em>. It may seem counterintuitive to make the first hurdle a particularly high one, but looked at a different way <em>1Q84</em> is a proposition so solid and implacable that it provides the perfect object to which to anchor myself. To make it through a 200 page novel without deviating into infidelity might be a fluke; if I can get straight through to the end of <em>1Q84</em> it’ll be something of an accomplishment.</p>\n<p>As of the time of writing I am making good progress (volume 2, page 617 to be exact), and I have every hope that I’m going to make it to the end uninterrupted. I <em>have</em>, I should admit, already begun to daydream about what to start next. Before this new regime came into play I purchased a copy of JJ Abrams &amp; Dave Dorst’s <em>S.</em> (2013) whilst waiting for a flight at JFK, and read the first 40 or so pages. That book is calling me back, though I have my reservations: at 472 pages it’s another fairly substantial commitment, plus the various convoluted machinations of the narrative and structure mean it requires close reading. Also, since the book is in some ways a celebration of the printed word it really needs to be read in paper form to be properly appreciated, and that would cut out nighttime iPad reading which is when I tend to make substantial progress. All of which is the kind of problem I don’t mind having!</p>\n<p>Right now, once I’m done with the Murakami, I like the idea of powering through something thin in a day or two and really trying to hit my stride. I’d like to finish more books in 2014, which in my case is a very different thing to ‘reading more’ - it just means more consistently finishing what I start.</p>\n",

I managed Teju Cole’s *Open City*, about half of Adelle Waldman’s *The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.*, 30 pages of Paul Auster’s *New York Trilogy*, and part of DeLillo’s *Falling Man*… the rest of the time was spent reading sections of Leo Hollis’s *Cities are Good For You*, and dipping into Ann Beattie’s *New Yorker Stories*. One book sparked off an interest in another, and reading each opened a new window onto the ones that came before and after. \n\nIn-and-of-itself this kind of scattershot approach to text selection is not an inherently bad thing; the only real shame of it is that I manage to see so few books through to the end. I have lost track of the number of novels, non-fiction books, and collections of short stories I have started in the last year, but I would guess that the number I have completed is in single digits. Reading for pleasure - or perhaps I should say ‘casual reading’, since reading for class was often also pleasurable - can (and perhaps should) be approached with a different mindset to reading for study. With no goal other than the completion of the text perhaps there is an argument to be made for giving oneself over to the book at hand and expending less energy on trying to understand its place within the larger literary universe. I’ve decided to put this idea to the test by resolving to read just one book at a time for a while. I think it might be interesting to see how my reading habits change, and whether I get something different from the texts when they’re read in isolation. \n\nTo test my newfound resolve the first novel I’ve decided upon is Haruki Murakami’s three-volume, 928-page opus *1Q84*. It may seem counterintuitive to make the first hurdle a particularly high one, but looked at a different way *1Q84* is a proposition so solid and implacable that it provides the perfect object to which to anchor myself. To make it through a 200 page novel without deviating into infidelity might be a fluke; if I can get straight through to the end of *1Q84* it’ll be something of an accomplishment. \n\nAs of the time of writing I am making good progress (volume 2, page 617 to be exact), and I have every hope that I’m going to make it to the end uninterrupted. I *have*, I should admit, already begun to daydream about what to start next. Before this new regime came into play I purchased a copy of JJ Abrams & Dave Dorst’s *S.* (2013) whilst waiting for a flight at JFK, and read the first 40 or so pages. That book is calling me back, though I have my reservations: at 472 pages it’s another fairly substantial commitment, plus the various convoluted machinations of the narrative and structure mean it requires close reading. Also, since the book is in some ways a celebration of the printed word it really needs to be read in paper form to be properly appreciated, and that would cut out nighttime iPad reading which is when I tend to make substantial progress. All of which is the kind of problem I don’t mind having!\n\nRight now, once I’m done with the Murakami, I like the idea of powering through something thin in a day or two and really trying to hit my stride. I’d like to finish more books in 2014, which in my case is a very different thing to ‘reading more’ - it just means more consistently finishing what I start. \n",

Softly spoken and delicately mannered he is a constant, still presence for most of his screen time. He speaks of himself with modesty and deprecation, and remains silent or displays good humour when others speak about him. A picture of Jiro&rsquo;s values comes together fairly quickly: dedication, pride, the struggle towards perfection. He remembers the seating order of guests so that he can serve slightly smaller portions to the women, ensuring that everyone finishes their courses at the same time.

				"content_text": "What is it about documentary as a medium that excites and interests us? Is it the chance to learn something about corners of the world, and the lives lived in them, which we otherwise wouldn't get to? Is it the chance to be inspired by another's accomplishment? Perhaps we hope to learn something about ourselves by learning about others.  \n <br>\n{{< vimeo id=\"35977910\" >}}\n \nDavid Gelb's feature-length profile of master sushi chef (or 'shokunin') Jiro Ono has all of these strengths: at once a fascinating portrait of an artisan and a vivid glimpse of life amid Tokyo fish markets and restaurant culture.\n\nJiro, still running a restaurant at the age of 85, is the film's mercurial centre. Softly spoken and delicately mannered he is a constant, still presence for most of his screen time. He speaks of himself with modesty and deprecation, and remains silent or displays good humour when others speak about him. A picture of Jiro's values comes together fairly quickly: dedication, pride, the struggle towards perfection. He remembers the seating order of guests so that he can serve slightly smaller portions to the women, ensuring that everyone finishes their courses at the same time. During the first course he notices guests' handedness and adjusts the placement of food on their plate for the next course as necessary.\n\nWhat makes the film so compelling is watching how these traits have shaped Jiro's life and the lives of those around him.

				"content_html": "<p>Whilst wandering around the internet recently, I came across this comic by <a href=\"http://www.incidentalcomics.com/\">Grant Snider</a>. I liked it instantly, clipped it, and then found myself going back to it frequently enough that it became obvious I had to write something about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/4781f02f60.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in minimalism, in its various forms, for quite a while: I find my interests leaning that way when it comes to design and architectural aesthetics; I wrote <a href=\"/uploads/2023/bf9357dbc8.pdf\">my Masters thesis</a> on the history of literary minimalism. Personally — and this was something that Snider&rsquo;s comic really brought home — my interest in minimalism is caught up with my interest in Buddhism. As I found myself thinking about the elements Snider had set out, I kept seeing parallels with Buddhist thought, and with my own practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-rid-of-the-unnecessary\">Get Rid of the Unnecessary</h2>\n<p>This is the core of it really, and it can be as prosaic or as profound as you like. Realising the difference between what is necessary and what is unnecessary is surpassingly difficult, and can easily equate to a lifetime&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s fascinating, as you get older, to discover how your attitudes to different elements of your life change — how things that once seemed so vital lose their pull, and that which you once wouldn&rsquo;t have given a second thought, takes on new importance. What is &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; is a shifting thing, and it <em>should be</em>. The valuable skill is tuning into what you honestly find to be important in the moment, and understanding your reasons. In that respect, minimalism emphasises focus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"create-structure\">Create Structure</h2>\n<p>Minimalism is also concerned with balance. As well as removing the extraneous, it&rsquo;s important to be mindful of how that which remains is arranged. Understanding the relationships between a structure&rsquo;s components is a central ideal of minimalism, whether it&rsquo;s the clean through-line of a short story, or the thoughtful arrangement of a room&rsquo;s furniture.</p>\n<p>Structure can also be constraining if employed too heavy-handedly, and I think there&rsquo;s a real difference between being aware of structure, and trying to impose it too strictly; if an <em>organic</em> structure works best, there&rsquo;s room for that too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stop-searching-for-hidden-meaning\">Stop Searching for Hidden Meaning</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to misread this one as a call for the acceptance of surfaces, and the surrender of one&rsquo;s exploratory impulse. I prefer to think of it in terms of spending less energy wondering about — or worrying about — the invisible, the possible, the elusive. For me it goes hand-in-hand with the next point…</p>\n<h2 id=\"embrace-what-is-solid\">Embrace What is Solid</h2>\n<p>Which is to say: be mindful of the present moment. One of the Buddhist principles I find most helpful, and yet most difficult to practice in daily life, is exactly this engagement with the moment itself. We&rsquo;re so used to looking forward and backward, and to thinking of things (and ourselves) in terms of our history and future. The minimalist call to stop looking for hidden meaning, and to embrace what&rsquo;s solid, is very similar to the Buddhist ideal of expending less energy on magical thinking, and more on the only real thing there is: the present moment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lose-yourself-in-patterns\">Lose Yourself in Patterns</h2>\n<p>There is a reason my first blog (more or less a decade ago!) was titled andthenpatterns. Yes, most directly it was named after the Four Tet track, but it&rsquo;s also down to how compelling I&rsquo;ve always found even the idea of patterns. Pretty much the only thing I took away from AS-Level maths was a glimpse at how numbers could produce some beautiful things. The application of that discipline was beyond me, but I took on a love of geometry that stays with me. This also speaks to the above points about structure and necessity; there can be nothing extraneous in a tessellation.</p>\n<p>Patterns also cropped up when I studied psychology, in relation to models of human cognition and memory. I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the extent to which patterns over which we have no control, dictate our experiences. In that regard, I like even more the specific manner in which this point is phrased: &lsquo;lose <em>yourself</em> in patterns&rsquo;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-fear-empty-space\">Don&rsquo;t Fear Empty Space</h2>\n<p>In terms of minimalist aesthetics, this can be read as a reminder that absence can be active. Whether it&rsquo;s the architecture of a physical space, the design of a webpage or printed document, or the form of a statue, this is a reminder that space can be just as important as content. Minimalism pushes back against the impulses to complicate and to fill every gap. I read this in conjunction with the first item: remove what isn&rsquo;t needed, and make the space which is created an integral part of the whole.</p>\n<p>This point also brings us right back to Buddhism again, where the concept of emptiness is key. To the extent that Buddhist practice is goal-oriented (and that&rsquo;s a whole other can of worms), one of the things it is working towards is the realisation that everything is empty. That sounds super-depressing until you begin to realise its implications. In part, that begins with the above points about the relationship between the solid, the moment, and literally everything else. Buddhists are big on causality — or dependent origination if you want to be fancy, — and the endgame is the realisation that emptiness and continuum are inescapable truths, and solidity is an illusion. If you&rsquo;re thinking that conflicts with the invocation to &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo; that&rsquo;s probably smart; I think that&rsquo;s a facet of the problem that Buddhism is engaged with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stay-clean\">Stay Clean</h2>\n<p>This is just good advice in general, but in terms of minimalist aesthetics it is probably best thought of (as with the patterns and the empty space above) with respect to the arrangement of elements. Removing the unnecessary is dependant on an understanding of what <em>is</em> necessary, and part of that is understanding the elements' relationships, one to another. In the visual arts you often hear people say things about &lsquo;clean lines&rsquo;; what that has always boiled down to for me, is an artist with a clear idea of how their work functions. Clarity is perhaps, overall, a more useful concept than cleanliness, but minimalism&rsquo;s rejection of needless complexity often makes the two synonymous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-bold-and-colourful\">Be Bold and Colourful</h2>\n<p>I like this one because it speaks out against the misconception of minimalism as overly subtle or reductionist. That might be true in some cases, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s inherent to minimalism as a style or as a concept. There&rsquo;s nothing subtle about work like Kasimir Malevich&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://artsy.net/artwork/kasimir-malevich-black-cross\">&lsquo;Black Cross&rsquo;</a>, or Sol Lewitt&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-number-1093-bars-of-color\">Wall Drawings</a> — these are undiluted artistic statements. Minimalism, in all its forms, can be enormously impactful by virtue of having cut away complicating factors. A minimalist work isn&rsquo;t engaged in too-clever obfuscation; it&rsquo;s asking to be engaged with by someone who is willing to &lsquo;stop looking for hidden meaning&rsquo; and &lsquo;embrace the solid&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s something inspiring in that plainness, as there is in the level of conviction that minimalism requires: it&rsquo;s a form without room for equivocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-be-too-expressive\">Don&rsquo;t Be Too Expressive</h2>\n<p>This is something that comes up a lot in reference to literary minimalism: the accusation (and the manner in which it&rsquo;s raised is almost always accusatory) that the language employed by writers like Raymond Carver, Amy Hempel <em>et al</em> is flat, disengaged, and emotionally barren.</p>\n<p>What is it about minimalism that shies away from the direct conveyance of emotion? The mistake that is often made is to suggest that this property of minimalism is resultant of fear of emotionality. This line of thinking holds that minimalism is dehumanising, and that it rejects emotions as too messy and unpredictable. Such an argument, however, assumes the prominence of emotionality in every sphere of our lives, and proceeds under the understanding that this is an unassailable state of affairs. Isn&rsquo;t there something to be said then for the minimalist model&rsquo;s placing emotion aside? By removing the unnecessary and giving emptiness its due, minimalism often (though not always) seeks to give us some room, and one important aspect of this room is to encourage reflection. For example, examination of one&rsquo;s <em>response</em> to a work of art can be an important manner of engagement. Avoidance of emotionality can be a high barrier for entry when approaching minimalism in the visual arts — and it is certainly a criticism favoured by those who deride literary minimalism — but I think there is something to be said for art that doesn&rsquo;t prescribe an emotional reaction.</p>\n<p>At the same time, much as I love minimalism, it would be myopic to suggest that it is universally appropriate. Minimalist artworks can be beautiful and meaningful, but there are places they cannot go. Similarly, minimalist music can be intricate and mesmerising, but you can&rsquo;t listen to Philip Glass all the time — you also need The White Stripes and Miles Davis, because, as messy as they are, they do things minimalism isn&rsquo;t interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"less-is-more-but-less-is-more-difficult-than-it-looks\">Less is More… But Less is More Difficult than it Looks</h2>\n<p>Read: this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>. Second only to the idea that it is reductionist, the next most common misconception of minimalism is that it is easy. Going right back up to the top, minimalism requires an understanding of what is necessary and what is not. It also necessitates a true understanding of the remaining parts' interoperability. You can&rsquo;t fake that, and attempts to do so are easily found out. True minimalism in any form is a pretty rigorous discipline.</p>\n<p>And, returning to a theme that has run throughout here, Buddhist practice can be the same. As the proverb goes: if you think doing nothing is easy, try it some time. Seriously, silent meditation is a great leveller, simply because it presents you with nothing but space for reflection — learning just to sit with yourself can be a really tough challenge, but that&rsquo;s the space from which everything else proceeds. Kind of like De Niro in his prime, you just have to learn to do nothing <em>really</em> well.</p>\n",

To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-the-xx--coexist\">20. The xx — <em>Coexist</em></h3>\n<p>Like a lot of people I discovered The xx in 2009 when it was already too late to\nnot be influenced in some respects by the hype surrounding their debut. In\nfollowing up the Mercury winning <em>xx</em> they have chosen to refine their sound\nrather than make any radical alterations to it, but the result is a more focussed\nalbum than their first. I feel about it similarly to how I feel about Portishead&rsquo;s\nfirst two albums: the second is a more complete and technically perfect\ndistillation of the band&rsquo;s sound, though (in both cases) I marginally prefer the\ndebut.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-the-mars-volta--noctourniquet\">19. The Mars Volta — <em>Noctourniquet</em></h3>\n<p>The Mars Volta have been with us for almost a decade now and I feel no closer to\nworking them out. As maddeningly obtuse as anything they&rsquo;ve ever put out,\n<em>Noctourniquet</em> continues in the vein of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Octahedron</em> but with added\ndark-synth elements that do something to compliment Cedric&rsquo;s vocals, which still\nwalk the line between seeming stream-of-consciousness &amp; tightly controlled.\nThis is an album full of wilful music that only just falls short of their peak to date,\nwhich remains <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em> (2008).</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-the-shins--port-of-morrow\">18. The Shins — <em>Port of Morrow</em></h3>\n<p>It was with no small amount of impatience that I waited five years for a follow-up\nto <em>Wincing the Night Away</em> - one of my favourite albums of 2007. If this new\neffort from James Mercer et al is lower down this list than expected it&rsquo;s\nperhaps owing to the fact that it takes so few risks. In projects like Broken Bells\nand the track on <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em>, Mercer has shown that he&rsquo;s willing and\nable to try different things, and yet <em>Port of Morrow</em> plays it so straight that it&rsquo;s\nhard not to feel just a touch cheated. The flip side of that coin is that what is here\nis quintessential Shins: &lsquo;Simple Song’ could be the band’s calling card. It&rsquo;s a\nrecord I enjoy a lot, but which found itself – fairly or not – dwarfed by five years of expectation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-fiona-apple--the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do\">17. Fiona Apple — <em>The Idler Wheel is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do</em></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s strange to think that Laura Marling&rsquo;s entire three-album career to date fits\ncomfortably within the gap between Fiona Apple records. Apple is in no rush,\nand the release of <em>Idler Wheel&hellip;</em> was rightly met with huge expectations. As it\nturns out it’s a complex beast of a record, ceaselessly expressive and\nimpassioned but, like its title, sometimes unwieldy and rarely neat. I don&rsquo;t say\nthat pejoratively, I feel like it’s a choice taken consciously in the putting together\nof the record, and one that often pays dividends. Apple&rsquo;s voice remains\nincredible, with some of the extents she pushes it to (on ‘Daredevil’ for example)\nbeing comparable to PJ Harvey&rsquo;s exploration of her limits on last year&rsquo;s <em>Let\nEngland Shake</em>. Far from easily digestible, and as such a hugely rewarding\nrecord. ‘Every Single Night’ remains the most stunning piece of music I heard all\nyear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-deadmau5---album-title-goes-here-\">16. Deadmau5 — <em>&gt; album title goes here &lt;</em></h3>\n<p>A late-in-the-year discovery for me prompted by looking into the track ‘Professional Griefers&rsquo; featuring Gerard Way on vocals. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here but I&rsquo;ve found this whole album to be a great late-night listen, full of glossy synth and colossal bass-driven rhythms. Way competes with Cypress Hill, and Imogen Heap (sadly not on the same track!) as MVP guest contributor, but just as many of the instrumental tracks are highlights. Perhaps not one I&rsquo;ll still be playing in five years’ time but I&rsquo;ve given it a fair few spins this winter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-liars--wixiw\">15. Liars — <em>WIXIW</em></h3>\n<p><em>WIXIW</em> is the latest despatch from Liars as they continue to occupy some kind of\nweird limbo where music is extrapolated from the more outré elements of\nRadiohead&rsquo;s <em>Amnesiac</em>. I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is I find so\nappealing about Liars, and yet, like the three albums that precede it (perhaps\n2007&rsquo;s self-titled release most of all) I find this stuff endlessly worthy of re-\nlistening, re-examining, further puzzling over. If anything there&rsquo;s a slight\ndetectable lightening of the musical palate here, on tracks like ‘No.1 Against the\nRush’, which helps distinguish this record from 2010&rsquo;s <em>Sisterworld</em> - you\ncouldn&rsquo;t call it a change of direction however, Liars’ direction remains resolutely\nundecided.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-blondes--blondes\">14. Blondes — <em>Blondes</em></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled to remember how I cam across this one; most likely it was added\nto the stack of new release playlists I tend to build up on a Monday and then not\nget around to listening to for months on end. Regardless, once I did get around to\ndelving into this dense thicket of electronic synth &amp; rhythms I found myself\nhooked. There&rsquo;s something appealing about this album&rsquo;s unknowability: its one-\nword song titles and stark typographic artwork. It&rsquo;s there in the music too: no\nquarter given, no concessions made - an album to take or leave on its merits.\nSomething about its swooping, echoing calls and 16bit-esque samples caught my\near.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-royal-headache--royal-headache\">13. Royal Headache — <em>Royal Headache</em></h3>\n<p>With an average song length somewhere south of two-and-a-half minutes this is\nthrillingly energetic, under-produced garage rock of the purest kind,\naccompanied by a flawless ear for infectious melodies &amp; hooks. There&rsquo;s also an\nunmistakable buoyancy to it, a non-ironic optimism that you can&rsquo;t help taking on\nas you listen. As such it&rsquo;s one of the most fun-loving and simply enjoyable albums\nof 2012.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-wallace-roney--home\">12. Wallace Roney — <em>Home</em></h3>\n<p>At the start of the year there were a couple of jazz records that I was looking\nforward to: Christian Scott&rsquo;s double-disk opus, and the new album from Robert\nGlasper. Roney wasn&rsquo;t on my radar at that time, but a couple of great reviews for\n<em>Home</em> got me interested, and the album quickly became a headphone favourite\nfor me. Roney&rsquo;s trumpet is superbly expressive: by turns manic and pacific, and\nthe overall spread of the album runs all over the tempo and emotional\nspectrums. ‘Evolution of the Blues’ is a stand out favourite, as it builds a theme\nover eight minutes whilst still allowing room for impressive trumpet and piano\nsolos. I had though, over the last couple of years, that piano-led jazz was my\nflavour of choice but Roney brought brass back in style for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-cloud-nothings--attack-on-memory\">11. Cloud Nothings — <em>Attack on Memory</em></h3>\n<p>This is a lean, wiry, noisy record from a band I had no familiarity with at the start\nof the year. It was Steve Albini&rsquo;s production that first keyed me into this album,\nand it remains an essential ingredient in what appeals to me about what is\nessentially a post-rock / grunge fusion sound. The space Albini gives the\nrecording, so that it sounds like it&rsquo;s unfolding live in some otherwise empty\nroom, is what makes these songs breathe - especially the album centrepiece:\n‘Wasted Days’. That track alone is a brave sonic experiment from a band whose\nback catalogue is decidedly poppier than <em>Attack on Memory</em> would lead you to\nbelieve. But this isn&rsquo;t just a nostalgia exercise for those of us who haven&rsquo;t heard\nanything that sounds like <em>In Utero</em> in a good long while. It&rsquo;s a smart set of dark\nrock songs that says everything it has to in 33 minutes and leaves you wanting to\nhit play again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-four-tet--pink\">10. Four Tet — <em>Pink</em></h3>\n<p><em>Pink</em> has taken Kieran Hebden quite some time to put together, and reads less\ncohesively than previous efforts <em>There is Love in You</em>, <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>\netc. but is no less impressive. Four Tet was one of the artists that opened the\ndoor for me to electronica ten or so years ago, and his prolific output is\nstill some of my favourite work in the (loose) genre. Hebden can do warm as well\nas anyone, whilst still feeling experimental and never stale: ‘Ocoras' is a prime\nexample. Album highlight for me though is the closer: ‘Pinnacles’, which had a 7&quot;\nrelease least year and has a play count somewhere in the high thirties last time I\nlooked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-regina-spektor--what-we-saw-from-the-cheap-seats\">9. Regina Spektor — <em>What We Saw from the Cheap Seats</em></h3>\n<p>The twin attractions of a Spektor record are her captivating, somersaulting voice,\nand her faultless sense of melodies that stick in your head despite being just the\nright degree of off-kilter. It took a while for me to get into this record, but once I\ndid (once those tunes worked their way in there) it was one that I returned to\njust to listen to a track or two with increasing frequency. Before I knew it most of\nthe album had worked its magic on me. I enjoyed 2009&rsquo;s <em>Far</em> but it fell short of\nthe album that brought her to my attention: <em>Begin to Hope</em> (2006). This one is\nright up there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-portico-quartet--portico-quartet\">8. Portico Quartet — <em>Portico Quartet</em></h3>\n<p>This is one of those tenacious ones: a January release that has stuck it out all year\nto claim a place in the top ten. In some ways a pretty unexpected sounding\nalbum, the instrumentation favours the electronic far more than on previous\nreleases, but its constantly impressive what four talented musicians can conjure\nfrom the less familiar. Tracks like &lsquo;Spinner&rsquo; still feel heavily jazz-influenced, but\nthey are counterbalanced by the more electronica-esque songs like ‘Rubidium’; it\nfeels like the album was sequenced with this balance in mind and it works\nsuperbly. I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll still be listening to this one for years, but I&rsquo;m also\nintrigued to know where Portico Quartet go next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-godspeed-you-black-emperor--allelujah-dont-bend-ascend\">7. Godspeed You! Black Emperor — <em>Allelujah! Don&rsquo;t Bend! Ascend!</em></h3>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t get into GY!BE until it was too late, and I would say it has been a long\nwait for new material only I didn&rsquo;t really consider it a possibility that there\nwould ever be any (see also My Bloody Valentine). The four tracks of\n<em>Allelujah!&hellip;</em> comprise one of the year&rsquo;s most perfectly coherent albums, to the\ndegree that it almost makes little sense to consider the tracks separately\nappreciable. Opener ‘Mladic’ is one of the finest pieces of music of 2012, but only\nbecause its glacial, intoxicating build over 20 minutes dissipates into the slow\ncrawl of &lsquo;Their Helicopters Sing’. This is music of considered construction and as\nsuch it seems a cheat to listen to anything less than the full 50+ minutes. That&rsquo;s\nsomething I&rsquo;ve only managed a handful of times this year but I&rsquo;ll be coming back\nagain - there&rsquo;s something special in here for sure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-ben-kweller--go-fly-a-kite\">6. Ben Kweller — <em>Go Fly a Kite</em></h3>\n<p>After reaching a high with his eponymous album in 2006, Kweller left me a little\ncold with 2009&rsquo;s <em>Changing Horses</em>. I applaud the effort at adding something to\nthe palate but I&rsquo;ve never been able to key into country music to any great extent\nand found the tweaks to Kweller&rsquo;s pop-rock sound a little off-putting. It&rsquo;s clear\nright out of the gate here that things are back on power-chord, bubblegum\ncourse and once it gets going <em>Go Fly a Kite</em> never really lets up. The jaunty\npiano sing-along of &lsquo;Gossip’ is vintage, and Kweller finds a new gear with ‘Justify\nMe’ that is thrilling to hear. Looking back over the five post-Radish solo albums\nit&rsquo;s very impressive how many great songs this guy has written.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-islands--a-sleep--a-forgetting\">5. Islands — <em>A Sleep &amp; A Forgetting</em></h3>\n<p>Islands’ previous album but one, <em>Arm&rsquo;s Way</em>, made an appearance on The List\nin 2008, and yet drawing comparisons between that record and this one seems of\nlittle value. (There is also the matter of 2009&rsquo;s <em>Vapours</em> which is a different\nanimal again.) Islands’ sole defining characteristic is Nick Thorburn - the series\nof line-up changes that has altered the face of the band over the last three albums\nis difficult to overstate.</p>\n<p>All of which is only important in as much as it informs the state of <em>A Sleep &amp; A\nForgetting</em>. A very personal record for Thorburn, written pretty much solo on\npiano and released on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, it is perhaps one of the finest modern\nexamples of that pop staple: the break-up album. In places melancholy, and in\nothers possessed of an infectious optimism, Thorburn is brilliantly adept at\ncapturing his mood in song, wrapping melodies perfectly to the feel of his odd,\nsometimes touching lyrics.</p>\n<p>At its core <em>AS&amp;AF</em> contains some of the year’s most memorable, whistleable,\nsing-along-able pop songs, the strength of which would be enough to find it a\nplace on this list. That it is this high up is owed to the emotional strength and\nvariety of the material. One of my most played albums this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bloc-party--four\">4. Bloc Party — <em>Four</em></h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago when it was announced that Bloc Party were going into\nhiatus it didn&rsquo;t feel like a permanent thing. As with the last decade of Silverchair&rsquo;s existence there was always that slight fear that they would drift apart and not find their way back to each other for an extended period, but four\nyears doesn&rsquo;t seem like an unreasonable length of time to wait, especially as it\nsaw the release of a very interesting solo album from Kele, which served as an\ninsight into the presence of different musical impulses within the band.\n<em>Four</em> doesn&rsquo;t feel like the product of a divided band at all. It&rsquo;s muscular and\nassured in every respect: a definitive statement. There is musical diversity here,\nfrom the tender ballad of &lsquo;Real Talk’ to ‘We Are Not Good People’ at the other end\nof the record&rsquo;s (and the band&rsquo;s) spectrum, but it comes across as cohesive and\nwell built. This is a set of musicians very familiar with each other&rsquo;s strengths and\nweaknesses and fully in command of what their band has been and can be.</p>\n<p>Repeated listens reveal a multitude of wonderful moments: the seductive bridge\nof &lsquo;3X3’, the none-more-angular guitar spine of ‘Octopus’, the Smashing-\nPumpkins-via-Weezer solo in &lsquo;Kettling&rsquo; - and it&rsquo;s out of these that the record as a\nwhole is built, moving from one to the next with a sure hand and without a\nmisstep.</p>\n<p>The only things to dislike about the record are its poorly conceived cover art and\nthe soon-irritating spoken interludes between numerous tracks. Luckily both of\nthese decisions are easily edited out via iTunes, leaving a pretty flawless 21st\ncentury pop-rock album.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-grimes--visions\">3. Grimes — <em>Visions</em></h3>\n<p>New discovery of the year goes to Grimes. I stumbled across the video for (album\nhighlight) ‘Oblivion’ on Pitchfork back in January and was instantly hooked. The\nalbum was one of the first I purchased this year, and between my iPod and the\nCD I burned for Elizabeth&rsquo;s car it must be one of my most listened to records of 2012. That I&rsquo;m nowhere near tired of it is a testament to the strength of the\nsongwriting. From the artwork to the videos and her on-stage abandon you\nmight not think that &lsquo;subtlety&rsquo; would be Grimes&rsquo;s strength but in large part it&rsquo;s\nthe ingredient that makes this album work. There&rsquo;s no overindulgence on this\nrecord, which moves sure-footedly around a dance/trance borderland knowing\nexactly when a dark bass grove or a distorted vocal is called for, but never\noverplaying these elements, content to let the kernel of the album&rsquo;s hypnotic\nrhythms do most of the talking.</p>\n<p>Also, she is <em>nearly</em> as entertaining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grimezsz\">on Twitter</a> as she is on record, so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-metric--synthetica\">2. Metric — <em>Synthetica</em></h3>\n<p>This is the kind of flawless start-to-finish pop record that only comes along very\nrarely. Somehow, over 11 tracks, Metric don&rsquo;t make a single misstep. It&rsquo;s been\none of those rare albums with which I&rsquo;m constantly undecided as to which is my\nfavourite track. The 40 minute run time fairly flies by in a whirl of soaring hooks,\nlap-drummable percussion, and singalong choruses, and I almost always want to\nhit play on this again.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing my favourite track is probably the perfect night-driving\nsoundtrack ‘Speed the Collapse’ or the year&rsquo;s best danceable anthem ‘Breathing Underwater’&hellip; or maybe twisted ballad &lsquo;Lost Kitten’. Stop asking me to choose!\nFor me this record harks back to Garbage at their mid-90s finest. That band&rsquo;s\nfirst two records were very important to me at the time, and still get the odd play\nnow, but <em>Synthetica</em> may well be better.</p>\n<p>..OK, my favourite is ‘Clone’. (Or maybe &lsquo;The Void&rsquo;.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-deftones--koi-no-yokan\">1. Deftones — <em>Koi No Yokan</em></h3>\n<p>Probably having read about it in the darkest corners of <em>Kerrang!</em> magazine, I\nstill remember putting down far too much money at my local Our Price to import a copy\nof 1995&rsquo;s <em>Adrenaline</em>. When it eventually turned up however, the wait and the\nmoney had proved to be well worth it. Unfairly tied to bands from the nu metal\nscene emerging at the same time, Deftones never really fit that mould: they were\ntoo melodic, too obtuse and, as the albums moved on, too romantic. <em>Around the\nFur</em> was nothing short of a new gospel to me when it arrived in 1997, and\n2000&rsquo;s <em>White Pony</em> is a religious text I still consult regularly today - without\nquestion one of my desert island discs and some days my favourite record of all\ntime.</p>\n<p>Solid and enjoyable as they most certainly are <em>Deftones</em> (2003), and <em>Saturday\nNight Wrist</em> (2006) failed to set my world alight as their three predecessors had\ndone. To listen back to those albums now (and they are still eminently listenable)\nsounds to me like a band treading water to some extent; re-working what they\ndid well with somewhat lesser returns.</p>\n<p>When Deftones shelved the almost complete <em>Eros</em> in 2009, following bassist\nChi Cheng&rsquo;s tragic accident (which leaves him in a coma to this day), it felt to me\nlike an admission that the band were struggling with their own identity. Particularly in the absence of a founding member it must have been incredibly\ndifficult to grasp what the band stood for anymore. However, with <em>Diamond\nEyes</em>, a soaring and heartfelt tribute to their friend, Deftones secured a place in\nmy top 10 for 2010. That record was proof that this was still a band capable of\ngreat things and <em>Koi No Yokan</em> is the fulfilment of that promise.\nIn many ways the culmination of all of Deftones’ strengths, this is a rock\nrecord full of tenderness and passion. As brutal as it is elegiac, and as romantic as\nit is bruising. No other band I know of under the sun can fuse these elements so\nflawlessly, and in <em>Koi No Yokan</em> Deftones have created something that can\nstand proudly shoulder to shoulder with their millennial masterpiece.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

The xx — *Coexist*\n\nLike a lot of people I discovered The xx in 2009 when it was already too late to\nnot be influenced in some respects by the hype surrounding their debut. In\nfollowing up the Mercury winning *xx* they have chosen to refine their sound\nrather than make any radical alterations to it, but the result is a more focussed\nalbum than their first. I feel about it similarly to how I feel about Portishead's\nfirst two albums: the second is a more complete and technically perfect\ndistillation of the band's sound, though (in both cases) I marginally prefer the\ndebut.\n\n###  19. The Mars Volta — *Noctourniquet*\n\nThe Mars Volta have been with us for almost a decade now and I feel no closer to\nworking them out. As maddeningly obtuse as anything they've ever put out,\n*Noctourniquet* continues in the vein of 2009's *Octahedron* but with added\ndark-synth elements that do something to compliment Cedric's vocals, which still\nwalk the line between seeming stream-of-consciousness & tightly controlled.\nThis is an album full of wilful music that only just falls short of their peak to date,\nwhich remains *The Bedlam in Goliath* (2008).\n\n###  18. The Shins — *Port of Morrow*\n\nIt was with no small amount of impatience that I waited five years for a follow-up\nto *Wincing the Night Away* - one of my favourite albums of 2007. If this new\neffort from James Mercer et al is lower down this list than expected it's\nperhaps owing to the fact that it takes so few risks. In projects like Broken Bells\nand the track on *Dark Night of the Soul*, Mercer has shown that he's willing and\nable to try different things, and yet *Port of Morrow* plays it so straight that it's\nhard not to feel just a touch cheated. The flip side of that coin is that what is here\nis quintessential Shins: 'Simple Song’ could be the band’s calling card. It's a\nrecord I enjoy a lot, but which found itself – fairly or not – dwarfed by five years of expectation.\n\n###  17. Fiona Apple — *The Idler Wheel is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do*\n\nIt's strange to think that Laura Marling's entire three-album career to date fits\ncomfortably within the gap between Fiona Apple records.

There's nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here but I've found this whole album to be a great late-night listen, full of glossy synth and colossal bass-driven rhythms. Way competes with Cypress Hill, and Imogen Heap (sadly not on the same track!) as MVP guest contributor, but just as many of the instrumental tracks are highlights. Perhaps not one I'll still be playing in five years’ time but I've given it a fair few spins this winter.\n\n###  15. Liars — *WIXIW*\n\n*WIXIW* is the latest despatch from Liars as they continue to occupy some kind of\nweird limbo where music is extrapolated from the more outré elements of\nRadiohead's *Amnesiac*.

The jaunty\npiano sing-along of 'Gossip’ is vintage, and Kweller finds a new gear with ‘Justify\nMe’ that is thrilling to hear. Looking back over the five post-Radish solo albums\nit's very impressive how many great songs this guy has written.\n\n###  5. Islands — *A Sleep & A Forgetting*\n\nIslands’ previous album but one, *Arm's Way*, made an appearance on The List\nin 2008, and yet drawing comparisons between that record and this one seems of\nlittle value. (There is also the matter of 2009's *Vapours* which is a different\nanimal again.) Islands’ sole defining characteristic is Nick Thorburn - the series\nof line-up changes that has altered the face of the band over the last three albums\nis difficult to overstate.\n\nAll of which is only important in as much as it informs the state of *A Sleep & A\nForgetting*. A very personal record for Thorburn, written pretty much solo on\npiano and released on Valentine's Day, it is perhaps one of the finest modern\nexamples of that pop staple: the break-up album. In places melancholy, and in\nothers possessed of an infectious optimism, Thorburn is brilliantly adept at\ncapturing his mood in song, wrapping melodies perfectly to the feel of his odd,\nsometimes touching lyrics.\n\nAt its core *AS&AF* contains some of the year’s most memorable, whistleable,\nsing-along-able pop songs, the strength of which would be enough to find it a\nplace on this list. That it is this high up is owed to the emotional strength and\nvariety of the material. One of my most played albums this year.\n\n###  4. Bloc Party — *Four*\n\nA couple of years ago when it was announced that Bloc Party were going into\nhiatus it didn't feel like a permanent thing. As with the last decade of Silverchair's existence there was always that slight fear that they would drift apart and not find their way back to each other for an extended period, but four\nyears doesn't seem like an unreasonable length of time to wait, especially as it\nsaw the release of a very interesting solo album from Kele, which served as an\ninsight into the presence of different musical impulses within the band.\n*Four* doesn't feel like the product of a divided band at all. It's muscular and\nassured in every respect: a definitive statement. There is musical diversity here,\nfrom the tender ballad of 'Real Talk’ to ‘We Are Not Good People’ at the other end\nof the record's (and the band's) spectrum, but it comes across as cohesive and\nwell built. This is a set of musicians very familiar with each other's strengths and\nweaknesses and fully in command of what their band has been and can be.\n\nRepeated listens reveal a multitude of wonderful moments: the seductive bridge\nof '3X3’, the none-more-angular guitar spine of ‘Octopus’, the Smashing-\nPumpkins-via-Weezer solo in 'Kettling' - and it's out of these that the record as a\nwhole is built, moving from one to the next with a sure hand and without a\nmisstep.\n\nThe only things to dislike about the record are its poorly conceived cover art and\nthe soon-irritating spoken interludes between numerous tracks. Luckily both of\nthese decisions are easily edited out via iTunes, leaving a pretty flawless 21st\ncentury pop-rock album.\n\n###  3. Grimes — *Visions*\n\nNew discovery of the year goes to Grimes. I stumbled across the video for (album\nhighlight) ‘Oblivion’ on Pitchfork back in January and was instantly hooked. The\nalbum was one of the first I purchased this year, and between my iPod and the\nCD I burned for Elizabeth's car it must be one of my most listened to records of 2012. That I'm nowhere near tired of it is a testament to the strength of the\nsongwriting. From the artwork to the videos and her on-stage abandon you\nmight not think that 'subtlety' would be Grimes's strength but in large part it's\nthe ingredient that makes this album work. There's no overindulgence on this\nrecord, which moves sure-footedly around a dance/trance borderland knowing\nexactly when a dark bass grove or a distorted vocal is called for, but never\noverplaying these elements, content to let the kernel of the album's hypnotic\nrhythms do most of the talking.\n\nAlso, she is *nearly* as entertaining [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz) as she is on record, so that's a plus.\n\n### 2. Metric — *Synthetica*\n\nThis is the kind of flawless start-to-finish pop record that only comes along very\nrarely. Somehow, over 11 tracks, Metric don't make a single misstep. It's been\none of those rare albums with which I'm constantly undecided as to which is my\nfavourite track. The 40 minute run time fairly flies by in a whirl of soaring hooks,\nlap-drummable percussion, and singalong choruses, and I almost always want to\nhit play on this again.\n\nAt the time of writing my favourite track is probably the perfect night-driving\nsoundtrack ‘Speed the Collapse’ or the year's best danceable anthem ‘Breathing Underwater’... or maybe twisted ballad 'Lost Kitten’. Stop asking me to choose!\nFor me this record harks back to Garbage at their mid-90s finest. That band's\nfirst two records were very important to me at the time, and still get the odd play\nnow, but *Synthetica* may well be better.\n\n..OK, my favourite is ‘Clone’. (Or maybe 'The Void'.)\n\n\n###  1. Deftones — *Koi No Yokan*\n\nProbably having read about it in the darkest corners of *Kerrang!* magazine, I\nstill remember putting down far too much money at my local Our Price to import a copy\nof 1995's *Adrenaline*. When it eventually turned up however, the wait and the\nmoney had proved to be well worth it. Unfairly tied to bands from the nu metal\nscene emerging at the same time, Deftones never really fit that mould: they were\ntoo melodic, too obtuse and, as the albums moved on, too romantic. *Around the\nFur* was nothing short of a new gospel to me when it arrived in 1997, and\n2000's *White Pony* is a religious text I still consult regularly today - without\nquestion one of my desert island discs and some days my favourite record of all\ntime.\n\nSolid and enjoyable as they most certainly are *Deftones* (2003), and *Saturday\nNight Wrist* (2006) failed to set my world alight as their three predecessors had\ndone. To listen back to those albums now (and they are still eminently listenable)\nsounds to me like a band treading water to some extent; re-working what they\ndid well with somewhat lesser returns.\n\nWhen Deftones shelved the almost complete *Eros* in 2009, following bassist\nChi Cheng's tragic accident (which leaves him in a coma to this day), it felt to me\nlike an admission that the band were struggling with their own identity. Particularly in the absence of a founding member it must have been incredibly\ndifficult to grasp what the band stood for anymore. However, with *Diamond\nEyes*, a soaring and heartfelt tribute to their friend, Deftones secured a place in\nmy top 10 for 2010. That record was proof that this was still a band capable of\ngreat things and *Koi No Yokan* is the fulfilment of that promise.\nIn many ways the culmination of all of Deftones’ strengths, this is a rock\nrecord full of tenderness and passion. As brutal as it is elegiac, and as romantic as\nit is bruising. No other band I know of under the sun can fuse these elements so\nflawlessly, and in *Koi No Yokan* Deftones have created something that can\nstand proudly shoulder to shoulder with their millennial masterpiece.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

In both cases I find the tools at users' disposal a little constraining: with the exception of an avatar and a header image there is no possibility of template personalisation (where would the adverts go!?), and the manner in which text, photos, video and everything else is displayed is dictated by the platform rather than the user.</p>\n<p>Tumblr represents a strange middle ground.

I like Tumblr, and aim to make more use of it going forward as a space to share content from around the web.

				"content_html": "<p>Film is a manipulative art form. Much of its effectiveness is derived from its ability to make us <em>feel</em>. We are carried along with the sweep of a well-executed dolly shot, or tricked by a jump-cut; we are caught up by the story&rsquo;s pace as determined in the editing room; our emotional response is keyed to and prompted by the score. The rudiments of film construction are all centred upon affecting the audience. Though that may read like a cynical view of the medium, it is in fact to cinema&rsquo;s great credit that it has evolved such a <em>direct</em> connection to viewers.</p>\n<p>For me there are perhaps no films more manipulative than those in the James Bond franchise. Like many filmgoers of my age (and older) I grew up with James Bond. <em>License to Kill</em> (1989) was the first entry in the series I saw in a cinema, when I was 8 years of age. It may well have been before that that I had started to accumulate other Bond films, recorded off Christmas television for endless replaying on our top-loading Betamax machine.</p>\n<p>One of the great draws of these films is the famous components that one expects to find in each instalment. There is something comforting in the inevitable introduction: &ldquo;Bond, James Bond&rdquo;, in the familiar strains of that theme song, and in knowing our hero&rsquo;s drink order. When so many elements of the piece are predefined, from the surrealistic music video title sequence to the promise during the credits that &lsquo;James Bond will return&rsquo;, it might seem that the screenwriter and director have a relatively easy job on their hands. String together a few action scenes set in exotic locales, add a dose of sex, a fist fight, and a car chase or two and send the thing out wrapped in a bow-tie.

Whilst many of the familiar tropes were in place the film, and its sequel <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008), lacked the wit that had characterised many of the series' previous entries. It felt as though the films' creators were trying to wrestle all of the franchise&rsquo;s peccadilloes into a new form, which left the results feeling straight-jacketed and unfulfilling. The post-Bourne, post-War on Terror straight-facedness of this new Bond did well at the box office and won over more than a few critics, but did so at the expense of some of the more human traits of the character and the series as a whole.</p>\n<p>This is clearly a problem with which screenwriters John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade, and director Sam Mendes engaged in shaping <em>Skyfall</em>. From the script level up the film is proudly indebted to its ancestry, and manages to go about the work of updating it in a more sure-footed manner than its two immediate predecessors. Instead of wholesale adoption of other series' stylistic choices the film takes the time to actively engage with Bond&rsquo;s past and to assess what place the character has in the modern world, and by extension modern cinema. So, whilst the film reintroduces the role of Q (sorely missing in the two Craig outings thus far), it makes explicit with a couple of lines of dialogue that there will be no &lsquo;exploding pens&rsquo; of the type wielded by Pierce Brosnan in <em>GoldenEye</em> (1995). The iconic Aston Martin DB5 is reprised as Bond&rsquo;s car of choice, and the advent of a new Miss Moneypenny is welcome, as is her reinvention as a capable former field agent.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that <em>Skyfall</em> is hands-down the most strikingly beautiful Bond movie to date. Mendes&rsquo;s style is impressively assured: his confidence in the material signalled by the use of a signature musical sting accompanying the film&rsquo;s very first image, and his confidence in Bond as an icon extending to a willingness to let key scenes play out entirely in silhouette. The film also marks yet another impressive entry in the exemplary career of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Many of the locations (especially Shanghai and Macau) and the shots that establish them are nothing short of breathtaking. But the real strength of <em>Skyfall</em> is the surety with which it navigates the balance of nostalgia and modernisation. Now entering its sixth decade as a film franchise it is remarkable that Sam Mendes has crafted a movie that balances the past and future of Bond so perfectly. The script, in the wording of Bond&rsquo;s (premature) obituary, openly recognises the character&rsquo;s role as &ldquo;emblematic of British fortitude&rdquo;, and the sense of Bond as symbol is strong throughout. He&rsquo;s compared by Q to an old warship, and equated by the film&rsquo;s villain with an antiquated way of doing things. At each turn the film is examining how and whether Bond fits.</p>\n<p>The film&rsquo;s villain is also a device through which Bond&rsquo;s own place is examined. A former agent and a previous protégé of M&rsquo;s, Silva is a mirror image of Bond. Like Conrad’s (&amp; Coppolla&rsquo;s) Kurtz  he is a brilliant operative gone rogue - at once a reminder and an indictment of the rules within which Bond exists. Previous villains in the series are roughly divisible into two categories: those who attack Bond through influence of their minds (Blofeld, Goldfinger et al) and those who pose a physical threat (Jaws, Red Grant etc.). Silva is different in that he is principally a threat to Bond&rsquo;s heart &amp; soul. A similar trick is being played here as is performed in Chris Nolan&rsquo;s <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), in which The Joker&rsquo;s aim is squarely on undermining Batman&rsquo;s values before anything else. Here, as in Nolan&rsquo;s film, it serves to reveal truths about Bond&rsquo;s character. Whilst he fails every test of physical fitness and mental acuity required to return to active service, M gives her approval of 007&rsquo;s return to the field based on what she knows of his spirit - the second and third acts of the film are trials to Bond through which M&rsquo;s judgement is proven correct. Bond is literally sent back to his roots, to the abandoned family home from which his trauma stems, and proves himself - within a stone&rsquo;s throw of his parents' gravestones - to be everything he attests to be. Mendes echoes the film&rsquo;s opening, in which Bond falls to his supposed death amid a surging river, by sending James back underwater to fight for his life - his self-proclaimed hobby of &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; put to the test.</p>\n<p>And with <em>Skyfall</em> Mendes has brought new purpose to a franchise which had felt somewhat directionless in recent years. Unquestionably a new Bond, but one that feels firmly grounded in an understanding of and and acceptance of the character&rsquo;s place in cinema history.  Bond&rsquo;s inclusion in the 2012 London Olympics' opening ceremony is a sign of his iconic status not just in British culture but universally. The lines from Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; that feature prominently at the culmination of the film&rsquo;s second act, seem to speak directly to the question of Britain&rsquo;s place in the modern world, and also to the matter of James Bond&rsquo;s place in modern cinema.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are not now that strength which in the old days<br>\nMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are,<br>\nOne equal-temper of heroic hearts,<br>\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is also that line, repeated by several characters throughout the film and easily read as a direct acknowledgement that not every change has been for the better: &ldquo;Sometimes the old ways are the best&rdquo;.

				"content_text": "Film is a manipulative art form. Much of its effectiveness is derived from its ability to make us *feel*. We are carried along with the sweep of a well-executed dolly shot, or tricked by a jump-cut; we are caught up by the story's pace as determined in the editing room; our emotional response is keyed to and prompted by the score. The rudiments of film construction are all centred upon affecting the audience. Though that may read like a cynical view of the medium, it is in fact to cinema's great credit that it has evolved such a *direct* connection to viewers. \n \nFor me there are perhaps no films more manipulative than those in the James Bond franchise. Like many filmgoers of my age (and older) I grew up with James Bond. *License to Kill* (1989) was the first entry in the series I saw in a cinema, when I was 8 years of age. It may well have been before that that I had started to accumulate other Bond films, recorded off Christmas television for endless replaying on our top-loading Betamax machine. \n\nOne of the great draws of these films is the famous components that one expects to find in each instalment. There is something comforting in the inevitable introduction: \"Bond, James Bond\", in the familiar strains of that theme song, and in knowing our hero's drink order. When so many elements of the piece are predefined, from the surrealistic music video title sequence to the promise during the credits that 'James Bond will return', it might seem that the screenwriter and director have a relatively easy job on their hands. String together a few action scenes set in exotic locales, add a dose of sex, a fist fight, and a car chase or two and send the thing out wrapped in a bow-tie.

As lifelong goofballs with a political conscience they also stood as license not to limit yourself be it musically, intellectually or in any other sphere of life. To my mind their 2004 album *To The Five Boroughs* remains the finest artistic response to the events of September 11, 2001.\n\nWhen Yauch was diagnosed with cancer in 2009 it came as a surprise. He was young and seemed healthy even in the video in which he gave fans the news. And even though an album got delayed and there had been no shows in quite a while I don’t think it really ever sunk in that he was sick - after all, he was still directing completely insane [half-hour music videos](http://youtu.be/evA-R9OS-Vo). One message that really hit home with me on Friday said simply ‘I don’t think I can live in a world where a Beastie Boy can die’\n\nA smart, kind, funny, basketball fan. A father. An activist, [Swiss-impersonator](https://www.beastiemania.com/whois/hornblower_nathanial/), vegan, Buddhist, and incredibly talented artist. It feels like a lot to lose all at once.\n\n<sc>RIP MCA</sc>\n",

				"title": "The List 2011",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-cold-war-kids--mine-is-yours\">20. Cold War Kids — <em>Mine Is Yours</em></h3>\n<p>This was a crazy sleeper for me, and even now it just creeps in at the bottom. Much as I love the first two records from this band (and the EP from last year for that matter), this album never clicked for me. If it were an album by a new band I would have given up on it after a couple of listens, but I know what CWK are capable of, and after a half-dozen plays I started to find it. There&rsquo;s still good stuff here, it just feels a little more dilute than previously, and certain tracks (e.g. &lsquo;Royal Blue&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Sensitive Kid&rsquo;) are plain irksome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-rival-schools--pedals\">19. Rival Schools — <em>Pedals</em></h3>\n<p>A long time coming, and in some respects it&rsquo;s like they never went away. Schreifels' voice is immediately recognisable, and still has the same emotive power and limited range as previously; the sonic make-up of the album as a whole is very similar to <em>United By Fate</em>. That there is a span of 10 years separating the records and yet they sound like they could be from the same recording session is about all there is to know. I&rsquo;m still fond of this music, but it&rsquo;s a nostalgic fondness; it would have been nice to have seen some experimentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-rem--collapse-into-now\">18. R.E.M. — <em>Collapse Into Now</em></h3>\n<p>And so it comes to pass that one of the most long-standing and consistently interesting rock bands calls time on its career. When the album was released we didn&rsquo;t know it would be R.E.M.&rsquo;s final studio record, which is to its benefit as it deserves to be assessed on its own merits. What we have here is not revolutionary, not nearly a match for their finest work, not quite a match for 2008&rsquo;s <em>Accelerate</em>, and yet it&rsquo;s beautifully made and possessed of many great moments and a couple of great songs. The legacy was set in stone by 1992, but this isn&rsquo;t a bad noise to go out to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-say-hi-to-your-mom--um-uh-oh\">17. Say Hi To Your Mom — <em>Um, Uh Oh</em></h3>\n<p>A seemingly effortless encapsulation of all that is best in so-called &lsquo;indie&rsquo; music, without falling into the genre&rsquo;s worst traits. Opener &lsquo;Dots On Maps&rsquo; is one of the year&rsquo;s catchiest singer-songwriter efforts, and it&rsquo;s followed, in &lsquo;Devils&rsquo;, by a song groovier than one man making music in his apartment has a right to be. This LP is shot through with charm and neat observation, great lyricism and catchy tunes that feel sculpted in the ease with which they sit warmly atop the brain. Zero pretention, just great songs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-j-live--spta-said-person-of-that-ability\">16. J-Live — <em>S.P.T.A. (Said Person Of That Ability)</em></h3>\n<p>My discovery of J-Live&rsquo;s <em>All of the Above</em> stands as one of the formative moments in my love of hip-hop; alongside Buck 65&rsquo;s <em>Square</em>, and Edan&rsquo;s <em>Primitive Plus</em> it expanded my ideas about what rap was capable of. I&rsquo;ve been waiting almost 10 years for him to match it, and despite good moments with the last two albums (2005 &amp; &lsquo;08) it was clear from first listen that this was the record I&rsquo;d been hoping for. Laid-back, smooth delivery combined with dense, intelligent lyricism and warm beats make this easy to listen to and rewarding to re-listen to. Great stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-tv-on-the-radio--nine-types-of-light\">15. TV On The Radio — <em>Nine Types Of Light</em></h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a consistent level of quality that you know you&rsquo;re going to get from a TVOTR record, and <em>Nine Types Of Light</em> doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The material here, if not quite as instantly memorable as that on <em>Dear Science</em>, is wall-to-wall engaging rhythms and hum-along vocal lines. You&rsquo;d have to try hard not to be charmed by this music, and though it doesn&rsquo;t completely live up to the standard of its predecessor it&rsquo;s still of enormously high-quality. (R.I.P. Gerard Smith)</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-floex--zorya\">14. Floex — <em>Zorya</em></h3>\n<p>On which one-man Czech electronica producer Tomáš Dvoák creates some of the most enchanting, beautiful music of 2011. Almost tidal in its gentle pacing, but enhanced with elements such as a jazz clarinet (&lsquo;Casanova&rsquo;) or an ethereal female vocal (&lsquo;Nel Blu&rsquo;) this caught hold of me straight away. The string heavy &lsquo;Veronika&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;, and the impressively lyrical &lsquo;Precious Creature&rsquo; are highlights for me on an album I loved from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-wild-flag--wild-flag\">13. Wild Flag — <em>Wild Flag</em></h3>\n<p>This record came as an unexpected pleasure: one of the year&rsquo;s best surprises. Having heard the single &lsquo;Glass Tambourine&rsquo; from SXSW coverage I had been waiting impatiently for the album to come out, not really knowing what to expect from it. I hadn&rsquo;t dared to hope that it would be of quite this high a quality, devoid of any pretention about its genesis, and just this much pure fun. This is joyful pop-rock made by musicians who sound like they&rsquo;re having a lot of fun doing so. There&rsquo;s a bushel of excellent 3-minute pop songs, balanced with a couple of more ambitious tracks like &lsquo;Racehorse&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s a balance that works perfectly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-lykke-li--wounded-rhymes\">12. Lykke Li — <em>Wounded Rhymes</em></h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago I downloaded the second Bat For Lashes LP not really knowing what to expect from a follow-up to such a singular debut. I found myself in a similar position on release day for the second Lykke Li album: was it going to sound like <em>Youth Novels</em>, or (a, seemingly, equally likely scenario) was she going to spin out in a completely different direction altogether? In the end it turns out that the former is closer to the truth, though <em>Wounded Rhymes</em> exhibits a sure-footedness beyond the idiosyncrasies of the first album, and perhaps a touch of darkness that wasn&rsquo;t present before. That&rsquo;s not to say that this is Lykke Li&rsquo;s <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, but there&rsquo;s a notable shift to darker tones in some places, even if the music remains pleasingly wrapped around bombastic percussion and pretty, melancholic vocal lines. Turns out that&rsquo;s all she had to do this time - but what&rsquo;s next?</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-foo-fighters--wasting-light\">11. Foo Fighters — <em>Wasting Light</em></h3>\n<p>Holy smokes? This has been a long time coming. Speaking as someone who adored the first three Foos records, and has endured everything since 1999 with decreasing levels of interest and rising levels of contempt, <em>Wasting Light</em> comes as something of a surprise, and a very welcome one. To me this is a turn around of almost (not quite) <em>Death Magnetic</em> proportions: a genuinely exciting rock album full of grade-A riffs, powerfully delivered vocals (and lyrics that don&rsquo;t (always) suck), and a self-assuredness earned after 15+ years in the business. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier that Grohl et al made this album; I honestly doubted that they still had it in them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-emmy-the-great--virtue\">10. Emmy The Great — <em>Virtue</em></h3>\n<p>Spoiler time: there is no Laura Marling album on this list. For whatever reason <em>A Creature I Do Not Know</em> failed to capture my imagination much: it seemed to be lacking the infectiousness of Marling&rsquo;s first two albums, ending up feeling a little watered-down and less than vital. By contrast Emmy The Great&rsquo;s second album is thrillingly alive, rich in colour and packed with wonderful tunes. There&rsquo;s a joy to this music, and it&rsquo;s delivered with unmistakable passion, but it&rsquo;s also tonally diverse: &lsquo;Creation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Iris&rsquo; seemingly belong at different ends of a spectrum, but they are both built assuredly with the tools of an impressive songwriter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-battles--gloss-drop\">9. Battles — <em>Gloss Drop</em></h3>\n<p>Nothing all year sounded like this. Maybe nothing since Battles&rsquo; debut sounded like this. I was somewhat worried, last year, by the departure from the band of Tyondai Braxton: it seemed an obvious equation at the time that a Battles LP without him would be something lesser than the debut, but for whatever reason it hasn&rsquo;t worked out that way. <em>Gloss Drop</em> contains more energy and freneticism than any three other art-rock records combined (John Stanier&rsquo;s drumming in particular is, frankly, ridiculous), and the very fact that it&rsquo;s harnessed into roughly song-shaped bursts between one and eight minutes is impressive. This record comes across like the love child of Mars Volta &amp; The Go! Team, but with more glitter and streamers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-das-racist--relax\">8. Das Racist — <em>Relax</em></h3>\n<p>So, my favourite hip-hop LP of the year is from an NY trio with a penchant for obscure humour and a talent for word-play so intricate that it takes weeks of re-listens to begin to pick it apart. And then all that is true about <em>this</em> record too. Relax has been on repeat for me for a long while as I switch my favourite lines on almost every listen and always find something new that makes me smile with how clever or arch it is. The production is all warm synths and crunchy beats, and all three members have the sort of laid-back flow that makes me fall in love with listening to this record first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening: a great wind-up/down album and one of my most listened to in the latter half of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-pj-harvey--let-england-shake\">7. PJ Harvey — <em>Let England Shake</em></h3>\n<p>I can hear it now: the glockenspiel melody that opens this album is one of 2011&rsquo;s most indelible sounds. Unfortunately, for me, the horn which ruins the next track of the album is a close runner-up. But that&rsquo;s one misstep on an otherwise masterful record of truly haunting, thought-provoking and beautiful music. Musically complex and unafraid of difficulty, the album remains accessible by virtue of being so pretty almost throughout. It&rsquo;s by no means an optimistic album, but there&rsquo;s a lot of life in there and I always felt I came away from listening to it feeling like I&rsquo;d gained something.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-bright-eyes--the-peoples-key\">6. Bright Eyes — <em>The People&rsquo;s Key</em></h3>\n<p>Though a little more rock-oriented than much of their previous output this record is unmistakably from the people who brought you <em>Lifted…</em> and <em>I&rsquo;m Wide Awake, It&rsquo;s Morning</em>. The vocal delivery is instantly recognisable, the lyrical smarts are present and correct, the rousing choruses are in place and we&rsquo;re all set for another super-enjoyable Bright Eyes record. I enjoyed walking around listening to this one, humming parts of it, singing others. It feels expansive (and not just because of the liberally used echoey production), assured and unafraid to be positive. &lsquo;Shell Games&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jejune Stars&rsquo; may be two of my favourite songs from the Omaha lot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-the-beastie-boys--hot-sauce-committee-pt-2\">5. The Beastie Boys — <em>Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2</em></h3>\n<p>It was on, it was off, it changed its title, re-arranged its tracklist (and then rearranged it back)… but it was worth waiting for. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that <em>To The 5 Boroughs</em> is seven years old (and <em>Hello Nasty</em> 13!), and putting the kind of forgettable instrumental album from &lsquo;07 aside this is the first we&rsquo;ve heard from the Boys in all that time. The fact that any doubts are set aside within literally the first 11 seconds of the album came as a huge relief, and from there on in it&rsquo;s just a masterclass in goofy wordplay, infectious beats, and raps about food. Sometimes a quick flick through <em>Spin</em> or <em>Pitchfork</em> has me feeling that musicians right now are far too concerned with how they dress, and their &lsquo;image&rsquo; in general - fine, but it seems to impact the music, and make for a lot of self-serious, super-credible albums that lack a sense of fun. The Beasties have been the answer to that for a while, and whether it&rsquo;s the hardcore-esque &lsquo;Lee Majors Come Again&rsquo;, the slow groove of &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s A Little Something For Ya&rsquo;, or the built-for-a-ghetto-blaster &lsquo;Make Some Noise&rsquo;… no one else does it quite like them. There&rsquo;s another album full of this stuff in the locker, and you&rsquo;ll be seeing it on this list next year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-radiohead--the-king-of-limbs--tkol-rmx-12345678\">4. Radiohead — <em>The King of Limbs</em> (&amp; <em>TKOL RMX 1234567(8)</em>)</h3>\n<p>Long awaited and yet unexpected, this was another surprise release strategy from Radiohead which brought us an album that felt instantly familiar and yet no less impressive for it. Around the album&rsquo;s release I read a bunch of comparisons to <em>The Eraser</em>, and that feels apt, though <em>TKOL</em> feels warmer, a little less downcast. The album has some serious swing to it (e.g. &lsquo;Little by Little&rsquo;), and moments of real beauty (e.g. &lsquo;Lotus Flower&rsquo;) - this feels like a band harnessing the power of <em>Kid A</em> / <em>Amnesiac</em> for good, a project they arguably started with <em>In Rainbows</em> but which is in full bloom now (pun intended).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m cheating here a little bit by including the set of 8 remix EPs that were released throughout the summer and autumn. I was constantly impressed with what other artists brought out of the tracks from <em>TKOL</em>, whether it was turning &lsquo;Give Up The Ghost&rsquo; into a trance floor-filler or making &lsquo;Bloom&rsquo; sound like it was going to kick your teeth in, it made me see the Radiohead album in a bunch of new lights and really enhanced my enjoyment of it. I probably listened to the remixes more than the original in the latter half of the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-feist--metals\">3. Feist — <em>Metals</em></h3>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this. I enjoyed <em>The Reminder</em>, though I came to it too late to get caught up in its spell of omnipresence in 2007. Perhaps as a result Feist has taken a back seat in my mind to Chan Marshall and Regina Spektor; it was immediately clear from my first listen to this album that that wasn&rsquo;t fair. <em>Metals</em> is a gentle, measured record filled with sunlight and beauty - it&rsquo;s truly a joyful listening experience. Both the instrumentation and production are warm and inviting; Feist&rsquo;s voice is capable of impressive range and has a great inner strength to it which carries these songs skipping along irresistibly. &lsquo;A Commotion&rsquo; is quite brilliantly agitated, and &lsquo;The Circle Married the Line&rsquo; is surpassing beautiful, and they are but two highlights on a flawless document of incredible talent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-björk--biophilia\">2. Björk — <em>Biophilia</em></h3>\n<p>Nothing I could say about this album could make it appeal to you if you&rsquo;re not already interested in Björk&rsquo;s continuing project to find new forms of musical expression. I could use terms like gravity harp, Tesla-coil organ, and MIDI-controlled gamelan–celesta hybrid… but you&rsquo;re unlikely to care if you didn&rsquo;t already find Björk fascinating. This album, a concept record dealing with life&rsquo;s place in the universe, is perhaps less accessible than 2007&rsquo;s dancier <em>Volta</em>, and is certainly full of music that would rightly be considered difficult. I can only say that I&rsquo;ve had some of the best listening experiences of my year with this album and I find it endlessly fascinating, stunningly ambitious, and as close to genius as music came in 2011.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-le-butcherettes--sin-sin-sin\">1. Le Butcherettes — <em>Sin Sin Sin</em></h3>\n<p>This came out of nowhere, a mention post-SXSW that Omar Rodriguez Lopez had signed the first band to his new label, produced the record, and played bass on it. That was enough to ensure that I put it on my mental list, and when I finally caught up with it my socks were well and truly blown off. There are similarities to Distillers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and maybe even a touch of SoaD in there too - but in truth <em>Sin, Sin, Sin</em> sounds entirely of itself. The sound of a passionate bunch of people making music with heart is impossible to fake, and in his production of this album Rodriguez Lopez has been sensible enough to capture it whole and not mess with it. Pretty much every time I put this on I had to listen through it; there&rsquo;s not a weak track amongst the feisty bunch.\nSo, 39 minutes of ridiculously catchy hooks, twisted-genius lyrics, and volcanic levels of energy… there&rsquo;s your album of the year.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->⏎ Return to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"/thelists\">index of lists</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n###  20. Cold War Kids — *Mine Is Yours*\n\nThis was a crazy sleeper for me, and even now it just creeps in at the bottom. Much as I love the first two records from this band (and the EP from last year for that matter), this album never clicked for me. If it were an album by a new band I would have given up on it after a couple of listens, but I know what CWK are capable of, and after a half-dozen plays I started to find it. There's still good stuff here, it just feels a little more dilute than previously, and certain tracks (e.g. 'Royal Blue' & 'Sensitive Kid') are plain irksome. \n\n###  19. Rival Schools — *Pedals*\n\nA long time coming, and in some respects it's like they never went away. Schreifels' voice is immediately recognisable, and still has the same emotive power and limited range as previously; the sonic make-up of the album as a whole is very similar to *United By Fate*. That there is a span of 10 years separating the records and yet they sound like they could be from the same recording session is about all there is to know. I'm still fond of this music, but it's a nostalgic fondness; it would have been nice to have seen some experimentation.\n\n###  18. R.E.M. — *Collapse Into Now*\n\nAnd so it comes to pass that one of the most long-standing and consistently interesting rock bands calls time on its career. When the album was released we didn't know it would be R.E.M.'s final studio record, which is to its benefit as it deserves to be assessed on its own merits. What we have here is not revolutionary, not nearly a match for their finest work, not quite a match for 2008's *Accelerate*, and yet it's beautifully made and possessed of many great moments and a couple of great songs. The legacy was set in stone by 1992, but this isn't a bad noise to go out to. \n\n###  17. Say Hi To Your Mom — *Um, Uh Oh*\n\nA seemingly effortless encapsulation of all that is best in so-called 'indie' music, without falling into the genre's worst traits. Opener 'Dots On Maps' is one of the year's catchiest singer-songwriter efforts, and it's followed, in 'Devils', by a song groovier than one man making music in his apartment has a right to be. This LP is shot through with charm and neat observation, great lyricism and catchy tunes that feel sculpted in the ease with which they sit warmly atop the brain. Zero pretention, just great songs. \n\n###  16. J-Live — *S.P.T.A. (Said Person Of That Ability)*\n\nMy discovery of J-Live's *All of the Above* stands as one of the formative moments in my love of hip-hop; alongside Buck 65's *Square*, and Edan's *Primitive Plus* it expanded my ideas about what rap was capable of. I've been waiting almost 10 years for him to match it, and despite good moments with the last two albums (2005 & '08) it was clear from first listen that this was the record I'd been hoping for. Laid-back, smooth delivery combined with dense, intelligent lyricism and warm beats make this easy to listen to and rewarding to re-listen to. Great stuff. \n\n###  15. TV On The Radio — *Nine Types Of Light*\n\nThere's a consistent level of quality that you know you're going to get from a TVOTR record, and *Nine Types Of Light* doesn't disappoint. The material here, if not quite as instantly memorable as that on *Dear Science*, is wall-to-wall engaging rhythms and hum-along vocal lines. You'd have to try hard not to be charmed by this music, and though it doesn't completely live up to the standard of its predecessor it's still of enormously high-quality. (R.I.P. Gerard Smith)\n\n###  14. Floex — *Zorya*\n\nOn which one-man Czech electronica producer Tomáš Dvoák creates some of the most enchanting, beautiful music of 2011. Almost tidal in its gentle pacing, but enhanced with elements such as a jazz clarinet ('Casanova') or an ethereal female vocal ('Nel Blu') this caught hold of me straight away. The string heavy 'Veronika's Dream', and the impressively lyrical 'Precious Creature' are highlights for me on an album I loved from start to finish.\n\n###  13. Wild Flag — *Wild Flag*\n\nThis record came as an unexpected pleasure: one of the year's best surprises. Having heard the single 'Glass Tambourine' from SXSW coverage I had been waiting impatiently for the album to come out, not really knowing what to expect from it. I hadn't dared to hope that it would be of quite this high a quality, devoid of any pretention about its genesis, and just this much pure fun. This is joyful pop-rock made by musicians who sound like they're having a lot of fun doing so. There's a bushel of excellent 3-minute pop songs, balanced with a couple of more ambitious tracks like 'Racehorse', and it's a balance that works perfectly. \n\n###  12. Lykke Li — *Wounded Rhymes*\n\nA couple of years ago I downloaded the second Bat For Lashes LP not really knowing what to expect from a follow-up to such a singular debut. I found myself in a similar position on release day for the second Lykke Li album: was it going to sound like *Youth Novels*, or (a, seemingly, equally likely scenario) was she going to spin out in a completely different direction altogether? In the end it turns out that the former is closer to the truth, though *Wounded Rhymes* exhibits a sure-footedness beyond the idiosyncrasies of the first album, and perhaps a touch of darkness that wasn't present before. That's not to say that this is Lykke Li's *The Empire Strikes Back*, but there's a notable shift to darker tones in some places, even if the music remains pleasingly wrapped around bombastic percussion and pretty, melancholic vocal lines. Turns out that's all she had to do this time - but what's next? \n\n###  11. Foo Fighters — *Wasting Light*\n\nHoly smokes? This has been a long time coming. Speaking as someone who adored the first three Foos records, and has endured everything since 1999 with decreasing levels of interest and rising levels of contempt, *Wasting Light* comes as something of a surprise, and a very welcome one. To me this is a turn around of almost (not quite) *Death Magnetic* proportions: a genuinely exciting rock album full of grade-A riffs, powerfully delivered vocals (and lyrics that don't (always) suck), and a self-assuredness earned after 15+ years in the business. I couldn't be happier that Grohl et al made this album; I honestly doubted that they still had it in them. \n\n###  10. Emmy The Great — *Virtue*\n\nSpoiler time: there is no Laura Marling album on this list. For whatever reason *A Creature I Do Not Know* failed to capture my imagination much: it seemed to be lacking the infectiousness of Marling's first two albums, ending up feeling a little watered-down and less than vital. By contrast Emmy The Great's second album is thrillingly alive, rich in colour and packed with wonderful tunes. There's a joy to this music, and it's delivered with unmistakable passion, but it's also tonally diverse: 'Creation' and 'Iris' seemingly belong at different ends of a spectrum, but they are both built assuredly with the tools of an impressive songwriter. \n\n###  9. Battles — *Gloss Drop*\n\nNothing all year sounded like this. Maybe nothing since Battles' debut sounded like this. I was somewhat worried, last year, by the departure from the band of Tyondai Braxton: it seemed an obvious equation at the time that a Battles LP without him would be something lesser than the debut, but for whatever reason it hasn't worked out that way. *Gloss Drop* contains more energy and freneticism than any three other art-rock records combined (John Stanier's drumming in particular is, frankly, ridiculous), and the very fact that it's harnessed into roughly song-shaped bursts between one and eight minutes is impressive. This record comes across like the love child of Mars Volta & The Go! Team, but with more glitter and streamers. \n\n###  8. Das Racist — *Relax*\n\nSo, my favourite hip-hop LP of the year is from an NY trio with a penchant for obscure humour and a talent for word-play so intricate that it takes weeks of re-listens to begin to pick it apart. And then all that is true about *this* record too. Relax has been on repeat for me for a long while as I switch my favourite lines on almost every listen and always find something new that makes me smile with how clever or arch it is. The production is all warm synths and crunchy beats, and all three members have the sort of laid-back flow that makes me fall in love with listening to this record first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening: a great wind-up/down album and one of my most listened to in the latter half of the year. \n\n###  7. PJ Harvey — *Let England Shake*\n\nI can hear it now: the glockenspiel melody that opens this album is one of 2011's most indelible sounds. Unfortunately, for me, the horn which ruins the next track of the album is a close runner-up. But that's one misstep on an otherwise masterful record of truly haunting, thought-provoking and beautiful music. Musically complex and unafraid of difficulty, the album remains accessible by virtue of being so pretty almost throughout. It's by no means an optimistic album, but there's a lot of life in there and I always felt I came away from listening to it feeling like I'd gained something. \n\n###  6. Bright Eyes — *The People's Key*\n\nThough a little more rock-oriented than much of their previous output this record is unmistakably from the people who brought you *Lifted…* and *I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning*. The vocal delivery is instantly recognisable, the lyrical smarts are present and correct, the rousing choruses are in place and we're all set for another super-enjoyable Bright Eyes record. I enjoyed walking around listening to this one, humming parts of it, singing others. It feels expansive (and not just because of the liberally used echoey production), assured and unafraid to be positive. 'Shell Games' and 'Jejune Stars' may be two of my favourite songs from the Omaha lot. \n\n###  5. The Beastie Boys — *Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2*\n\nIt was on, it was off, it changed its title, re-arranged its tracklist (and then rearranged it back)… but it was worth waiting for. It's hard to believe that *To The 5 Boroughs* is seven years old (and *Hello Nasty* 13!), and putting the kind of forgettable instrumental album from '07 aside this is the first we've heard from the Boys in all that time. The fact that any doubts are set aside within literally the first 11 seconds of the album came as a huge relief, and from there on in it's just a masterclass in goofy wordplay, infectious beats, and raps about food. Sometimes a quick flick through *Spin* or *Pitchfork* has me feeling that musicians right now are far too concerned with how they dress, and their 'image' in general - fine, but it seems to impact the music, and make for a lot of self-serious, super-credible albums that lack a sense of fun. The Beasties have been the answer to that for a while, and whether it's the hardcore-esque 'Lee Majors Come Again', the slow groove of 'Here's A Little Something For Ya', or the built-for-a-ghetto-blaster 'Make Some Noise'… no one else does it quite like them. There's another album full of this stuff in the locker, and you'll be seeing it on this list next year. \n\n###  4. Radiohead — *The King of Limbs* (& *TKOL RMX 1234567(8)*)\n\nLong awaited and yet unexpected, this was another surprise release strategy from Radiohead which brought us an album that felt instantly familiar and yet no less impressive for it.

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2023/dadbf701ac.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ofelia Hunt is the author of the novel <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em>, recently published by Magic Helicopter Press, as well as several poems and short stories scattered around the internet. The following interview was conducted via a series of emails.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><strong>Adam Wood</strong>: For the most part I’m going to pretend I didn’t see the copyright page in the front of the book, though I kind of had to look after that line on your blog that says ‘Ofelia Hunt may not be 100% real.’ Is that the first thing everybody asks? Do you think people get too hung up on the pseudonym thing?</p>\n<p><strong>Ofelia Hunt</strong>: I don’t know. The name Ofelia Hunt sounds (to me) like a fake name (it was based originally on an old Police drama, <em>Hunter</em>—I had recurring thoughts of the show, was wondering how it had disappeared). I do fear somebody will get pissed at me and start shouting, like, ‘authenticity’ and try to slap me with an oar or throw kittens, at a reading, perhaps. I could have a depressive breakdown at the microphone, and begin sobbing about alcoholism and the patriarchy.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: This is your first novel, but you’ve published a bunch of poetry and some short stories with Bear Parade before now. Did you find it different writing a novel, and how did the decision to do that come about?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I hate when people say something ‘occurred organically’, or whatever. So I’ll say this: I’ve always wanted to write novels. I’ve written three and half other novel/novella type things that weren’t very good or which lost their energy part way through. I felt like the stories in Bear Parade were a great way to prepare for a novel. In my head, the stories and the novel all have the same narrator. She may have different names or live in different places, but she’s the same person. Her style of narration evolved, in terms of sentence structure, paragraphing, etc… as I edited <em>T&amp;T</em>. But I feel like <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> could be read in conjunction. Or as a footnote or something. To some degree, the poems I wrote around that time are the same character as well. I’ve read that some writers map out, outline, or even write out character histories. I don’t, but the short stories and poems formed a sort of foundation for <em>T&amp;T</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve read in interviews that you wrote most of the short stories that make up <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> in one sitting. How did you approach writing when it came to the novel: a chapter at a time?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: All the stories in <em>My Eventual Bloodless Coup</em> are maybe 300-900 words long. This is about the maximum I can write in one sitting, while still having time to edit and come up with something I will like (at least in the moment).</p>\n<p>For the first draft I wrote straight through, chapter by chapter. I had this conception there would be two parts of twelve chapters, for twenty-four total, maybe representing an hour for each chapter, but only loosely. I wrote every day, about 500 words a day. I edited everything I had written before writing the next 500 words until this began to take too long, then I edited only the previous day’s work before writing new words. I also edited while writing. And then edited straight through several times. According to my Word document properties dialog box, the final version I have was revised 159 times with a total revision time of 65,230 minutes. I don’t know what that means.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Your characters–and especially your narrator–seem to latch onto thoughts or words or sounds, and those things come up again and again. Does that come from an interest in how language works, or how certain people think? What’s behind that?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m very interested in how language works, how people work, how people work with language. Sometimes I imagine words on a tape (think 1950s computer technology) being fed into a person, by way of ear or mouth, in a sort of programming, and wonder what happens to the people after that. In a way, this is how I interact with people. Constant testing. I have difficulty communicating with other humans, especially when I first meet someone. It’s like I have to test, test, test, and find a new method each time. And in my head I often hear recurring words or phrases. I’m prone to repeating them over and over, as though the phrase itself is a joke. For example: “dollar dollar bills.” I used to walk up to friends I knew and repeat these phrases aloud and then walk away. I woke up this morning thinking, “donkey wayside mortuary.” Perhaps this is garbage language. Maybe I’m interested in garbage language. Where it comes from, where it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I think there’s certainly a heavy reliance on ‘naturalism’ in popular literature, and that comes at the expense of exploring other ideas of how people actually think and speak. Dialogue (internal and otherwise) like yours strikes the ear as authentic precisely because it contains all of these little loops and flaws.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yeah, realism/naturalism seem very concerned with creating a digestible whole, where each image/dialog/thought fits together all puzzle-like and calculated. Like a little machine you wind up and ride to epiphany. I feel ashamed to have typed that, a little, as I generally avoid similes. But maybe language, or garbage language can work machine-like also, or like dozens of machines, crawling from little round mouths.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: There’s a moment in the novel when the narrator says “I push piano-keys in a rhythmic way but with no regard for sound or beauty” (p.52). That kind of unlocked the novel for me, I think. There’s all this repetition and the writing pulls the reader along really powerfully, but without regard for traditional plot or narrative arcs. Would you say you’re more interested in how it ‘feels’ to read your writing as opposed to what it ‘means’?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Yes. The idea that a ‘text’ could be easily interpreted into ‘meaning’ has always bothered me. Traditional narrative arcs are very predictable. By way of television, schooling, ‘genre’ (whatever that means), news media, we (or at least I) are/was indoctrinated into this very basic structure. I feel infuriated when a news report takes a very complex issue and turns into a digestible narrative arc: the US economy has slowed because of X or Y. Now we can ‘like’ it or not. Now we know who to blame. I hate the feeling of knowing what will happen next. I want to be surprised at every moment.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: That’s increasingly true of every sphere of life, I think: that binary reductivism. Do you think it’s your wish to be surprised that leads you to reject traditional plotting?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I think that’s part of it. Traditional plotting also involves a lot of planning. A lot of reshaping the text to fit the constraint of the narrative arc. I’m not interested in it enough to do it well. I’m more interested in writing sentences that sound how I think sentences should sound (at least mine), and assembling those sentences together in a way that pleases me. This leads me towards surprise (a lot of humor for me is surprise) and perhaps emotion.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I’ve been describing the novel to people as kind of Kmart realism but with particular tendencies towards violence. Does that seem fair? How do you think of the book if you think of it in those terms at all?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: When I was small, my parents took me to Kmart to buy shoes. I don’t think in those terms, but I do admire the ‘Kmart Realists’. Anne Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, Joy Williams, Raymond Carver. Maybe Sartre can fall into this type of category in terms of stylistic representation of ‘reality’. Marguerite Duras? Robbe-Grillet? I know that in writing <em>T&amp;T</em>, I was very focused on attempting to represent how a mind works. I was reading a lot of Jean Rhys. I was thinking about the realism of Stephen Dixon’s writing. Stephen Dixon is probably the best I’ve read at representing a mind at work. Particularly in <em>Interstate</em>, which is a horrifically close third person. I wanted to write horrifically close first person. I want to experience ‘reality’ as an other.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Have you read Nicholson Baker also? He’s very interested in the intimate details, but the language is less spontaneous, more studied, almost essayistic.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I haven’t, though I just now read a little from <em>The Mezzanine</em> online. I like the singular focus on details, and the way they seem to swarm together, as though each little detail is more important than any character.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: I read about this thing at Stanford called the Lit Lab, where they built a piece of software that analyses writing. They feed in all of these novels and plays and poems and this thing is slowly learning how to categorise literature on a purely empirical basis, instead of cognitively or emotionally, like a human might.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I like that idea. I think <em>T&amp;T</em> might get categorized as a YA novel maybe, because of the fairly simple sentence structures, and maybe elementary school level word choice.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: You know Pirooz Kalayeh and Tao Lin, right? Are you involved at all with the film they’re making of Tao’s novella <em>Shoplifting from American Apparel</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m not involved with that, but I am excited to see the film. And also to see <em>The Human War</em>, another Pirooz Kalayeh film based on the novel by Noah Cicero.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Seems like <em>Today &amp; Tomorrow</em> would be almost impossible to film because so much of it is internal to the narrator’s experience. It would make a great audiobook though; is there a Hollywood actress you would like to record an audiobook version?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I agree. Any film of <em>T&amp;T</em> would probably be doomed by its lack of plotting. Not much happens that’s filmable and there’d have to be a ton of voiceover. I think the audiobook could be read very effectively by many actors: Frances McDormand (<em>Blood Simple</em>), Joan Chen (<em>Twin Peaks</em>), Scarlett Johansson (<em>Lost in Translation</em>), Felicia Pearson (<em>The Wire</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: What’s next for you? I assume you’re someone for whom writing is an almost daily part of life, regardless of whether you’ve got a ‘project’ in mind, but is there anything particular you’re working towards?</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: I’m working on something that might be a novella, currently titled <em>Voltron</em> which might be about trailer parks. I’m also writing a series of short stories called <em>Horrorcore</em>. So far these have been stories written in about one hour that feature creepy imagery. Maybe they’re related to Horrorcore rap/hip hop.</p>\n<p><strong>AW</strong>: Ofelia, thanks for talking to me about all this.</p>\n<p><strong>OH</strong>: Dude, thank you.</p>\n",

				"title": "Black Swan dir. Darren Aronofsky (2010)",
				"content_html": "<p>When I left the dingy Odeon cinema in Reading after seeing <em>Fight Club</em> in 1999, I felt elated. The movie had surprised and thrilled me, done things I&rsquo;d never seen on the screen before, and knocked me back in my seat with its last 20 minutes. Fincher&rsquo;s film was brave and brash and masculine, and — like Palahniuk&rsquo;s book — it challenged some assumptions about what it meant to be a man in the modern world. The psychoses resulting from the protagonist&rsquo;s breakdown fuel the movie, and really give you a picture of a person&rsquo;s mental state, as well as his time and place. Leaving the beautiful Curzon in Soho yesterday, having just watched <em>Black Swan</em>, I was struck by the similarities to <em>Fight Club</em>, and the extent to which Aronofsky has made a really wonderful, feminine counterpart to that film.</p>\n<p>Like the earlier story, this one is driven by psychosis stemming from the protagonist&rsquo;s neuroses. Nina Sayers is beset by all kinds of questions about her femininity: she has multiple body issues which are both shown in the film and hinted at in her past; her relationship with her mother is mutually overdependent to increasingly uncomfortable levels; her sexual repression inhibits her both emotionally and as a dancer.

				"content_text": "When I left the dingy Odeon cinema in Reading after seeing *Fight Club* in 1999, I felt elated. The movie had surprised and thrilled me, done things I'd never seen on the screen before, and knocked me back in my seat with its last 20 minutes. Fincher's film was brave and brash and masculine, and — like Palahniuk's book — it challenged some assumptions about what it meant to be a man in the modern world. The psychoses resulting from the protagonist's breakdown fuel the movie, and really give you a picture of a person's mental state, as well as his time and place. Leaving the beautiful Curzon in Soho yesterday, having just watched *Black Swan*, I was struck by the similarities to *Fight Club*, and the extent to which Aronofsky has made a really wonderful, feminine counterpart to that film. \n\nLike the earlier story, this one is driven by psychosis stemming from the protagonist's neuroses. Nina Sayers is beset by all kinds of questions about her femininity: she has multiple body issues which are both shown in the film and hinted at in her past; her relationship with her mother is mutually overdependent to increasingly uncomfortable levels; her sexual repression inhibits her both emotionally and as a dancer. Just as *Fight Club*'s narrator struggles to adjust to a world in which what is expected of men has become unclear, Nina finds herself unsure in her roles as ingénue, seductress, daughter, and modern woman.\n\n*Black Swan*'s script is brilliantly crafted to give Nina any number of models to measure herself against. Her mother was a dancer, and now has (too) high expectations of her; the fate of Winona Ryder's character — who precedes Nina as the ballet company's lead soloist — serves as an object lesson; Mila Kunis's new girl to the class seems to be Nina's shadowy opposite... and then there's Nina herself. In almost every scene of *Black Swan* we are presented with multiple Ninas, as Aronofsky's camera seeks out each mirror in every room. Rarely do we see Natalie Portman without *also* seeing her doubled, moving differently, from some other angle. It's a variation on techniques employed in any number of horror movies, but it is still masterfully done here, and pushed to an extent throughout the film's running time that leaves the viewer dizzy, and a little unsure of what they're seeing.\n\nNatalie Portman is all over this film. Appearing not just in every scene, but multiple times in most; her face also appears on other characters' bodies, in dreams, on posters....

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"20-ok-go--of-the-blue-colour-of-the-sky\">20. OK Go — <em>Of the Blue Colour of the Sky</em></h3>\n<p>It’s a great feeling to be surprised by an album, and even more special when it happens more than once within the same record. Even having heard very little of the previous material I thought I had OK Go pegged: another spiky pop band in the Tapes n’ Tapes, Hot Hot Heat mould but with more innovative promo videos. It turns out there’s a lot more to the Chicago four-piece than that.</p>\n<p>As those self-made videos attest, this is a band bursting at the seams with ideas, and on this album they let rip with a multitude of styles, delivering dance-rock (‘This Too Shall Pass’), ballads (‘Skyscrapers’) and synth-pop (‘End Love’) among others. The album highlight is a toss-up between the shockingly on-the-money Prince tribute ‘White Knuckles’ and the surprisingly tender digital lament ‘Before the Earth was Round’. In some respects it’s shocking that those two songs exist on the same album. That OK Go attempt so much here and pull it off without a misstep is deserving of enormously impressive.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"19-the-posies--blood--candy\">19. The Posies — <em>Blood / Candy</em></h3>\n<p>Along with Brad’s <em>Interiors</em> (1997) and Screaming Trees’ <em>Dust</em> (1996), I treasure The Posies’ 1993 album <em>Frosting on the Beater</em> for having shaped something special out of the beautiful, melodic aspects of grunge without having felt it necessary to pretend at angst. I dipped into some of the band’s other records but didn’t find anything as consistently engaging. Likewise with albums since; I listened to 2005’s <em>Every Kind of Light</em> a fair bit, but I honestly don’t remember whether it claimed a place on my year end List.</p>\n<p>Having taken a bit of a break since then it seems that some of the old magic has been recaptured. <em>Blood / Candy</em> is a set of three and four-minute easygoing pop gems with just the right touch of melancholic edge to them. Opener ‘Plastic Paperbacks’ is expertly judged, and enough by itself to assure you that this is a band (having been recording since the late 80s) in full command of their talents. The subtle mood-swings of ‘Cleopatra Street’ are further proof that The Posies are capable of pretty much anything they turn their mind to, and the three and half minutes of ‘For The Ashes’ prove it, crafting something heartbreaking and huge-seeming out of very little.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18-flying-lotus--cosmogramma\">18. Flying Lotus — <em>Cosmogramma</em></h3>\n<p>I remember seeing a lot of positive things written about the previous Flying Lotus album—2008’s Los Angeles—but for whatever reason I never got around to picking it up. When <em>Cosmogramma</em> dropped in early summer I was sure to get in on the ground floor, and I discovered an album of dense, vital electronica brimming with energy and ideas.</p>\n<p>My touchstone for this genre remains Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet, and what Flying Lotus is doing here is a little messier and, I would guess, more aimed at the headphones than Kieran Hebden’s recent output, which has been more club-oriented.</p>\n<p>The Thom Yorke cameo on ‘…And the World Laughs with You’ is an easy highlight, but in some ways (e.g. it features vocals) it’s an outlier. This is a really interesting, layered record that I returned to a lot when zoning out during commutes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17-four-tet--there-is-love-in-you\">17. Four Tet — <em>There is Love in You</em></h3>\n<p>My relationship with Four Tet is rooted in 2003’s <em>Rounds</em> and 2005’s <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>, and it seems a long time since anything new has been released. That’s slightly misleading in that Kieran Hebden is a prolific remixer of everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Radiohead, and has, in the intervening five years, put out two EPs and two very strong albums of material with jazz drummer Steve Reid.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s nice to have a new, full-length release from Four Tet. I’ve played the 2008 EP <em>Ringer</em> quite a bit, but somehow it felt like something of a stop-gap, and this album shows why. Hebden has been hosting nights at Shoreditch’s Plastic People for a while now, and has talked in several interviews about how the experience has affected his music. What separates this album from its predecessors is that it was built to be played to a live audience whereas the previous LPs fall into what I would categorise as headphone listening. That’s not to say that they wouldn’t work the other way round, but the shift is noticeable here on tracks like ‘Sing’ which loops and swings with a very singular purpose. I would guess that I’ll return to <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> more, but this is still wonderful stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16-loscil--endless-falls\">16. Loscil — <em>Endless Falls</em></h3>\n<p>This was a discovery via Bleep.com, which has been good to me over the last couple of years when it comes to electronic music. On the mental list of artists in this genre, which I keep arranged by pace and tone, Loscil sits towards the slower, calmer end of the spectrum and has served as perfect reading music, winding down music, and getting-started music in roughly equal measure.</p>\n<p>The album’s cover photograph of blurry street furniture seen through a rain-splashed window sets the mood quite well. The album starts with what feels like almost a full minute of rain noise (which I’ve always been a sucker for anyway) and the pace doesn’t pick up a whole lot from there. It’s hard to put on paper what works so well about the music here. It develops at a glacial pace and all exists within the same tonal colour pallet of greys and blues, but this is expertly and subtly constructed stuff with genuine weight behind it.</p>\n<p>Of the instrumental music I’ve played a lot this year <em>Endless Falls</em> has leant itself least to being used as background music. Something about its intricate shadows and textures insists upon attention and patience, which it rewards with great depth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15-she--him--volume-two\">15. She &amp; Him — <em>Volume Two</em></h3>\n<p>Having this album sat next to Loscil highlights the absurdity of drawing comparisons between much of this year’s listening material. All I can say is that I listened to Volume Two a lot and, despite its seeming simplicity, it didn’t even begin to get old.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most apt adjective for this album is “charming”. The record is immensely and instantly likeable, thanks in part to Deschanel’s voice—which resembles a slightly softer Jenny Lewis—and also to the quirky, poppy arrangements of many of the songs. Sometimes it sounds like 1950s bubblegum (‘Gonna Get Along Without You Now’ could be a Chordettes cover), sometimes like the Beach Boys (‘Don’t Look Back’), but regardless the quality never lets up and it’s impossible not to be swept up in its enthusiasm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-joanna-newsom--have-one-on-me\">14. Joanna Newsom — <em>Have One on Me</em></h3>\n<p>Unique doesn’t begin to cover Joanna Newsom. Placing her in the folk category seems dismissive of her sound’s expansiveness and her penchant for theatricality. The lyrics are certainly folky in that they often convey stories woven out of pastoral themes, but (just as with Laura Marling) there’s a lot more going on here.</p>\n<p>On 2006’s <em>Ys</em>, Newsom really embraced the drama of her songwriting, bringing in Van Dyke Parks to add flourishes and even more colour to her songs. Arguably this led to the album feeling a little too dense and claustrophobic, an impression not helped by its composition: five tracks with an average length somewhere north of 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>By contrast, though it exhibits a markedly longer running time, <em>Have One On Me</em> seems less weighty, airier, possessed of more space and sunlight. Many songs are stripped back simply to Newsom’s voice and harp, which have always been the core of her art and have never been better than here. To a greater extent than any other record I listened to this year, Newsom’s album offers you a chance to put on headphones and drift away to a different place entirely. She remains quite unique.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-laura-marling--i-speak-because-i-can\">13. Laura Marling — <em>I Speak Because I Can</em></h3>\n<p>Laura Marling’s 2008 debut was that rare thing in the world of the modern music press: an unexpected delight; a surprise. That voice, the very English-ness of her sensibility, her ability to seem and sound simultaneous fragile and formidable. It was immediately clear that Marling was a prodigious talent and the purveyor of a quite unique sound, and that album was by far and away my favourite of the year.</p>\n<p>Since then it seems that a number of acts have attempted to peddle a faux-folksy kitsch in Marling’s wake, and it has more often than not rang a little false to my ears. Marling’s sincerity is palpable and her ability to tell a story in each beautiful song is unparalleled among her peers. <em>I Speak Because I Can</em> is a more assured album, and a mesmerising one. The swinging melody of ‘Alpha Shallows’, the heart-wrenching beauty of ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’, the barefoot do-si-do of album closer ‘Nature of Dust’… everything here is masterfully accomplished and infused with limitless warmth and charm. If it falls short of its predecessor it is perhaps only because it comes as no surprise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-olafur-arnalds--and-they-have-escaped-the-weight-of-darkness\">12. Olafur Arnalds — <em>…And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness</em></h3>\n<p>Arnalds is a 24 year-old Icelandic multi-instrumentalist making stunningly beautiful avant-garde orchestral electronica. This has been on rotation right alongside the Loscil album as perfect examples of simple music displaying almost limitless depths. Listened to on headphones it reveals itself to be utterly compelling and endlessly beautiful, as well as quite a draining listening experience. The way the simple melody of ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’ blossoms, for example is masterful, and the introduction of the cymbals at the three-minute mark is one of the most raw emotional moments I heard this year.</p>\n<p>The album’s tone shares some similarities with Arnalds’ more famous countrymen Sigur Rós, and the fact that he has duplicated their sheer expansiveness of sound, and retained their balance of complexity and simplicity whilst playing and constructing everything himself is, frankly, astounding.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-christian-scott--yesterday-you-said-tomorrow\">11. Christian Scott — <em>Yesterday You Said Tomorrow</em></h3>\n<p>When I started getting into hip-hop in the late ‘90s, I started digging for those “important” and “classic” LPs from a jumping off point of Run DMC, Public Enemy and R.A.T.M.’s <em>Renegades</em>. But I didn’t feel properly engaged in the genre until I stumbled across a contemporary artist who blew my mind: Buck 65’s <em>Square</em> (2002) completely changed my thinking about hip-hop and made the music feel really alive to me.</p>\n<p>So, when I started to get serious about jazz a few years back I tried from the outset to make it an equal part of my self-education in the genre to find contemporary artists. Jason Moran and Robert Glasper have both appeared on previous lists, but this year Christian Scott re-defined my ideas about what’s possible in jazz with this astounding record.</p>\n<p>Listening back through Scott’s catalogue this isn’t a fluke: both 2006’s <em>Rewind That</em> and the following year’s <em>Anthem</em> are enormously assured and overflowing with brilliance. One listen to the latter’s opener ‘Litany Against Fear’ is all the evidence required for jazz’s contemporary vitality.</p>\n<p><em>Yesterday…</em> however, is probably my favourite of the three, with album highlight, the achingly plaintive ‘Isadora’, standing as the most beautiful song I heard in 2010.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-keith-jarrett--charlie-haden--jasmine\">10. Keith Jarrett &amp; Charlie Haden — <em>Jasmine</em></h3>\n<p>Jarrett took 14th place on last year’s list with <em>Yesterdays</em>, a record I described at the time as “not my favourite Jarrett album”, and this year he takes 10th with absolutely my favourite of his recordings that I’ve heard.</p>\n<p>Jarrett’s collaboration with bassist Charlie Haden stretches back to 1967 and now numbers eight albums. Listening to <em>Jasmine</em> it’s easy to see why the two keep returning to this partnership. Jarrett’s playful, light piano swims effortlessly atop the subtle thrum of Haden’s double-bass undertow, knowing exactly when to allow the latter time to rise to the surface momentarily. The connection (as I said last year of Omar &amp; Cedric) must be near psychic to produce something so effortlessly unified. It’s a joy to listen to and endlessly relaxing.</p>\n<p>\u000c</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-deftones--diamond-eyes\">9. Deftones — <em>Diamond Eyes</em></h3>\n<p>It’s fifteen years since I fell under Deftones’ spell with the visceral post-punk thunder-dirge of <em>Adrenaline</em>, and a decade since they hit their peak with the heavenly <em>White Pony</em>, which remains on my list should I have to pack five albums for a desert island.</p>\n<p>2005’s eponymous album, whilst still solid, felt a little lacking, but they really hit their stride again with 2006’s <em>Saturday Night Wrist</em>. And then the worst happened. During recording for what was to be a back-to-basics rock record titled <em>Eros</em>, bassist Chi Cheng was hit by a car. <em>Eros</em> was shelved indefinitely and it looked for a while like Deftones had come to an end.</p>\n<p>Cheng remains in a coma, and with <em>Diamond Eyes</em> his bandmates set out explicitly to make an album that would honour him. And what a fantastic tribute they have paid. By turns angry, beautiful, contemplative and celebratory this is their finest album in ten years and sounds not unlike <em>White Pony</em> in terms of breadth of tone and dusky, humid production style. Deftones remain a singular band, devoid of genre, possessed of limitless talent and still capable of surprising me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-broken-bells--broken-bells\">8. Broken Bells — <em>Broken Bells</em></h3>\n<p>I only really got into The Shins with 2007’s <em>Wincing the Night Away</em>, and it seems cruel to have made me wait so long for a follow-up to an album I enjoyed so much. With no sign of James Mercer getting back in the studio with the rest of his band, this will have to do for now, so it’s a good job it’s terrific.</p>\n<p>Mercer has a very expressive voice, which, alongside his brilliant lyrics, is my favourite aspect of The Shins. It’s just as well served here by Danger Mouse’s beats, which are more melodic than some of his work (e.g. with Jemini, or arguably Gnarls Barkley); it’s perhaps closer to his production of the Sparklehorse albums and Beck’s <em>Modern Guilt</em> a couple of years ago. The lyrics and vocal performance remain the highlight for me, but the dreamy bedding of ‘Your Head is on Fire’ or the hazy synth strings of ‘Citizen’ are what hold this odd, lovable album together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-vampire-weekend--contra\">7. Vampire Weekend — <em>Contra</em></h3>\n<p>Where did Vampire Weekend come from? Who told them it was okay to make this twice-concentrated infectious indie-intellectual-pop with afro influences? After the 35 minutes of V.W.’s debut dominated my stereo almost exclusively for months, I remained unsure that a second album of the same kind of material would be as satisfying. What <em>Contra</em> proves is that this isn’t a gimmick, and that if you have it in you to produce more of this ultra-catchy pop music it should be mandatory that you do so.</p>\n<p>Vampire Weekend are doing many of the same things here as they seemingly invented on their debut, but the trick isn’t worn out, it’s just as energising and refreshing as first time around. Absolutely devoid of cynicism and full to the brim with enthusiasm for life and music, this is another summer album that has proven to be great listening throughout the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-surfer-blood--astro-coast\">6. Surfer Blood — <em>Astro Coast</em></h3>\n<p>It can’t be easy being an indie buzz band. For all of the hype-fed blog hysteria, there is (just as inevitably) the backlash. The hipsters have this down so well now that, to the average observer, the two seem almost simultaneous, leaving one unsure whether it’s cool to like Surfer Blood this week or not.</p>\n<p>But who cares when the music is this good? I’ll admit that, perhaps as a result of buying into some of that hype, the first time I heard <em>Astro Coast</em> I made unfriendly comparisons to Vampire Weekend. Unfriendly in that they were tainted with a pinch of copycat accusation, but the more I listened to the album the weaker that connection seemed, until I now almost can’t understand how I made it in the first place.</p>\n<p><em>Astro Coast</em> is a killer mix of debut album Weezer and <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Beach Boys, with a little So-Cal punk stirred in there for good measure. The result is sunny and infectious, and if there is a Vampire Weekend comparison it’s perhaps in the music seeming completely familiar very quickly. These songs feel as though you always knew them, and any time you play them it’s summer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-charlotte-gainsbourg--irm\">5. Charlotte Gainsbourg — <em>I.R.M.</em></h3>\n<p>I didn’t think much of Gainsbourg’s previous solo album, <em>5:55</em> (2006), but when I heard the single ‘Heaven Can Wait’ which preceded this album I knew I had to at least give the record a try. And it’s a revelation.</p>\n<p>The only explanation I can find for the chasm of difference in quality between the two albums is that Gainsbourg, like a crystal, seemingly absorbs the characteristics of those around her. <em>5:55</em> had Jarvis Cocker and Air all over it, and not enjoying the work of either of those artists I was put off by its euro-poppy production and coy foppishness.</p>\n<p><em>I.R.M.</em> is a different beast. It’s tonally a little darker and packed full of the kind of tunes that the first album was missing. Gainsbourg has a strong, melodic voice, and Beck (as producer here) knows just how to use it. In fact the album exhibits Beck’s influence in myriad interesting, non-obtrusive ways; so much so that it almost feels like a collaboration. It’s quirky and knowing and unafraid to explore itself, and as a result it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard in 2010.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-robyn--body-talk\">4. Robyn — <em>Body Talk</em></h3>\n<p>Full disclosure: Whiz has been into Robyn for some time, and if it wasn’t for her I don’t know how long it would have taken me to overcome my impression of Robyn (based on very little evidence) as just another dance starlet with little else to offer.</p>\n<p><em>Body Talk</em> was originally released as a set of three EPs throughout the year, but Robyn helped me out in terms of list-eligibility by collating them into a single release that stands as the most energetic and fun album to occupy my headphones all year. Full of colossal glowing synth, the kind of bass that pulls you in two directions at once and some deliciously funny and caustic lyricism, this is ridiculously catchy, grade-A, thoroughbred dance-pop.</p>\n<p>In a sea of indie and rock albums that come freighted with issues of credibility and hipness it was a pleasure to have something that did its job unquestionably by making me dance whilst I vacuumed, sing whilst I walked, and smile each and every time it came on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-buck-65--20-odd-years\">3. Buck 65 — <em>20 Odd Years</em></h3>\n<p>Much like Robyn’s <em>Body Talk</em>, this was released as a series of four EPs throughout the year, but alas no collated album has been forthcoming. <em>20 Odd Years</em>, however, necessitates the bending of list eligibility rules as to omit it on the grounds that it was released in parts would be nothing short of a colossal tragedy (especially as a collected edition is forthcoming).</p>\n<p>The project marks the 20th year of Buck’s hip-hop career, and its material is suitably eclectic, taking in Buck’s various guises as romantic, goofball, virtuoso etc. etc. There’s very little Buck can’t do and do well, and the mix of styles here is somewhat dizzying. Replete with multiple guest vocalists and DJs this is a riotous celebration of a unique talent, never less than absolutely riveting and almost dangerously entertaining – just like the man himself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-my-chemical-romance--danger-days-the-true-lives-of-the-fabulous-killjoys\">2. My Chemical Romance — <em>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</em></h3>\n<p>It’s been a long, almost unbearable wait since 2006’s <em>The Black Parade</em>. Four years in which MCR have broken themselves down and built themselves back up again (less one member), taken off the black clothes and swapped them for the most colourful things they could find. And what of the music? <em>Danger Days</em> sounds very little like its predecessor. In places it resembles a neon-infused version of 2004’s <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em>; like that album the overarching concept has the protagonists on the run, and the music is infused with a dynamism arguably lacking from the majority of the more meditative <em>Black Parade</em>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the key to the differences between the albums is in the music out of which they are grown. If <em>The Black Parade</em> was a distorted gothic version of Queen, the soil in which <em>Danger Days</em> is planted is pure Springsteen-esque Americana as seen through a caffeinated hurricane of comic book images, muscle cars, and toy laser guns.</p>\n<p>Frank Iero has called the album “the soundtrack to raging against the death of the creative spark”, echoing Gerard Way’s concerns about what entering his 30s meant for his art. And this does sound like a band who feel as though they have something to prove. Unquestionably they succeed in doing so.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-arcade-fire--the-suburbs\">1. Arcade Fire — <em>The Suburbs</em></h3>\n<p>What’s the strongest run of three studio albums you can think of? <em>The Bends, OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em>? <em>Off the Wall, Thriller</em> and <em>Bad</em>? <em>Master of Puppets, …And Justice for All</em> and <em>Metallica</em>?</p>\n<p>Which band / artist has the best set of three studio albums to <em>start</em> their career? Nirvana? Björk? Deftones? Bloc Party? Foo Fighters?</p>\n<p>Arcade Fire are undoubtedly something special. In an era that has seen the decline of the physical format and where “shuffle” has become the predominant listening experience, they are a quintessential album band. They are forthright and outspoken in their political convictions; indefatigable in their touring schedule; meticulous in their standards of quality. In the 44 tracks that make up their three albums and one EP to date there is not one weak song.</p>\n<p><em>The Suburbs</em> is a remarkable achievement in and of itself: a beautiful, thoughtful record of songs full of longing and loss, love and loneliness and a pursuit of meaning. Its influences—as with the band’s previous albums—come from the middle of the North American radio dial, and no band is able to make that music seem so shiningly vital as Arcade Fire do on track after track.</p>\n<p>The most insightful commentary I’ve seen on the album reads it as part of a trilogy. The feeling of longing to leave home, which is present on <em>Funeral</em> (particularly the ‘Neighborhood’ tracks) is mirrored in the return here of an older and wiser narrative voice to the place of its youth. <em>Neon Bible</em>, which sits in the middle as the record of worldly experience is noticeably darker and more preoccupied with menacing themes. <em>The Suburbs</em> sounds more comfortable and reflective by comparison, but is just as emotionally wrought in its own way.</p>\n<p>It’s a stunning collection of songs, somehow living up to the astronomical expectations with which I awaited it; it also stands as further confirmation that Arcade Fire are the most consistently inspired and inspiring band recording today.

				"content_text": "<span style=\"color: #cfcfcf\">At the end of each year I make a list of the twenty albums I enjoyed the most. To be eligible, a record has to be of album length (at least ~30 mins), and contain entirely (or almost entirely) new material; live albums, cover records, and compilations are ineligible.</span>\n\n### 20. OK Go — *Of the Blue Colour of the Sky*\n\nIt’s a great feeling to be surprised by an album, and even more special when it happens more than once within the same record. Even having heard very little of the previous material I thought I had OK Go pegged: another spiky pop band in the Tapes n’ Tapes, Hot Hot Heat mould but with more innovative promo videos. It turns out there’s a lot more to the Chicago four-piece than that. \n\nAs those self-made videos attest, this is a band bursting at the seams with ideas, and on this album they let rip with a multitude of styles, delivering dance-rock (‘This Too Shall Pass’), ballads (‘Skyscrapers’) and synth-pop (‘End Love’) among others. The album highlight is a toss-up between the shockingly on-the-money Prince tribute ‘White Knuckles’ and the surprisingly tender digital lament ‘Before the Earth was Round’. In some respects it’s shocking that those two songs exist on the same album. That OK Go attempt so much here and pull it off without a misstep is deserving of enormously impressive. \n\n\u000c\n###  19. The Posies — *Blood / Candy*\n\nAlong with Brad’s *Interiors* (1997) and Screaming Trees’ *Dust* (1996), I treasure The Posies’ 1993 album *Frosting on the Beater* for having shaped something special out of the beautiful, melodic aspects of grunge without having felt it necessary to pretend at angst. I dipped into some of the band’s other records but didn’t find anything as consistently engaging. Likewise with albums since; I listened to 2005’s *Every Kind of Light* a fair bit, but I honestly don’t remember whether it claimed a place on my year end List. \n\nHaving taken a bit of a break since then it seems that some of the old magic has been recaptured. *Blood / Candy* is a set of three and four-minute easygoing pop gems with just the right touch of melancholic edge to them. Opener ‘Plastic Paperbacks’ is expertly judged, and enough by itself to assure you that this is a band (having been recording since the late 80s) in full command of their talents. The subtle mood-swings of ‘Cleopatra Street’ are further proof that The Posies are capable of pretty much anything they turn their mind to, and the three and half minutes of ‘For The Ashes’ prove it, crafting something heartbreaking and huge-seeming out of very little. \n\n###  18. Flying Lotus — *Cosmogramma*\n\nI remember seeing a lot of positive things written about the previous Flying Lotus album—2008’s Los Angeles—but for whatever reason I never got around to picking it up. When *Cosmogramma* dropped in early summer I was sure to get in on the ground floor, and I discovered an album of dense, vital electronica brimming with energy and ideas. \n\nMy touchstone for this genre remains Keiran Hebden’s Four Tet, and what Flying Lotus is doing here is a little messier and, I would guess, more aimed at the headphones than Kieran Hebden’s recent output, which has been more club-oriented. \n\t\nThe Thom Yorke cameo on ‘…And the World Laughs with You’ is an easy highlight, but in some ways (e.g. it features vocals) it’s an outlier. This is a really interesting, layered record that I returned to a lot when zoning out during commutes. \n\n###  17. Four Tet — *There is Love in You*\n\nMy relationship with Four Tet is rooted in 2003’s *Rounds* and 2005’s *Everything Ecstatic*, and it seems a long time since anything new has been released. That’s slightly misleading in that Kieran Hebden is a prolific remixer of everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Radiohead, and has, in the intervening five years, put out two EPs and two very strong albums of material with jazz drummer Steve Reid. \n\t\nStill, it’s nice to have a new, full-length release from Four Tet. I’ve played the 2008 EP *Ringer* quite a bit, but somehow it felt like something of a stop-gap, and this album shows why. Hebden has been hosting nights at Shoreditch’s Plastic People for a while now, and has talked in several interviews about how the experience has affected his music. What separates this album from its predecessors is that it was built to be played to a live audience whereas the previous LPs fall into what I would categorise as headphone listening. That’s not to say that they wouldn’t work the other way round, but the shift is noticeable here on tracks like ‘Sing’ which loops and swings with a very singular purpose. I would guess that I’ll return to *Everything Ecstatic* more, but this is still wonderful stuff.  \n\n###  16. Loscil — *Endless Falls*\n\nThis was a discovery via Bleep.com, which has been good to me over the last couple of years when it comes to electronic music. On the mental list of artists in this genre, which I keep arranged by pace and tone, Loscil sits towards the slower, calmer end of the spectrum and has served as perfect reading music, winding down music, and getting-started music in roughly equal measure. \n\nThe album’s cover photograph of blurry street furniture seen through a rain-splashed window sets the mood quite well. The album starts with what feels like almost a full minute of rain noise (which I’ve always been a sucker for anyway) and the pace doesn’t pick up a whole lot from there. It’s hard to put on paper what works so well about the music here. It develops at a glacial pace and all exists within the same tonal colour pallet of greys and blues, but this is expertly and subtly constructed stuff with genuine weight behind it. \n\t\nOf the instrumental music I’ve played a lot this year *Endless Falls* has leant itself least to being used as background music. Something about its intricate shadows and textures insists upon attention and patience, which it rewards with great depth. \n\n###  15. She & Him — *Volume Two*\n\nHaving this album sat next to Loscil highlights the absurdity of drawing comparisons between much of this year’s listening material. All I can say is that I listened to Volume Two a lot and, despite its seeming simplicity, it didn’t even begin to get old. \n\t\nPerhaps the most apt adjective for this album is “charming”. The record is immensely and instantly likeable, thanks in part to Deschanel’s voice—which resembles a slightly softer Jenny Lewis—and also to the quirky, poppy arrangements of many of the songs. Sometimes it sounds like 1950s bubblegum (‘Gonna Get Along Without You Now’ could be a Chordettes cover), sometimes like the Beach Boys (‘Don’t Look Back’), but regardless the quality never lets up and it’s impossible not to be swept up in its enthusiasm. \n\n###  14. Joanna Newsom — *Have One on Me*\n\nUnique doesn’t begin to cover Joanna Newsom. Placing her in the folk category seems dismissive of her sound’s expansiveness and her penchant for theatricality. The lyrics are certainly folky in that they often convey stories woven out of pastoral themes, but (just as with Laura Marling) there’s a lot more going on here.\n\t\nOn 2006’s *Ys*, Newsom really embraced the drama of her songwriting, bringing in Van Dyke Parks to add flourishes and even more colour to her songs. Arguably this led to the album feeling a little too dense and claustrophobic, an impression not helped by its composition: five tracks with an average length somewhere north of 10 minutes. \n\t\nBy contrast, though it exhibits a markedly longer running time, *Have One On Me* seems less weighty, airier, possessed of more space and sunlight. Many songs are stripped back simply to Newsom’s voice and harp, which have always been the core of her art and have never been better than here. To a greater extent than any other record I listened to this year, Newsom’s album offers you a chance to put on headphones and drift away to a different place entirely. She remains quite unique. \n\n###  13. Laura Marling — *I Speak Because I Can*\n\nLaura Marling’s 2008 debut was that rare thing in the world of the modern music press: an unexpected delight; a surprise. That voice, the very English-ness of her sensibility, her ability to seem and sound simultaneous fragile and formidable. It was immediately clear that Marling was a prodigious talent and the purveyor of a quite unique sound, and that album was by far and away my favourite of the year. \n\t\nSince then it seems that a number of acts have attempted to peddle a faux-folksy kitsch in Marling’s wake, and it has more often than not rang a little false to my ears. Marling’s sincerity is palpable and her ability to tell a story in each beautiful song is unparalleled among her peers. *I Speak Because I Can* is a more assured album, and a mesmerising one. The swinging melody of ‘Alpha Shallows’, the heart-wrenching beauty of ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’, the barefoot do-si-do of album closer ‘Nature of Dust’… everything here is masterfully accomplished and infused with limitless warmth and charm. If it falls short of its predecessor it is perhaps only because it comes as no surprise. \n\n###  12. Olafur Arnalds — *…And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness*\n\nArnalds is a 24 year-old Icelandic multi-instrumentalist making stunningly beautiful avant-garde orchestral electronica. This has been on rotation right alongside the Loscil album as perfect examples of simple music displaying almost limitless depths. Listened to on headphones it reveals itself to be utterly compelling and endlessly beautiful, as well as quite a draining listening experience. The way the simple melody of ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’ blossoms, for example is masterful, and the introduction of the cymbals at the three-minute mark is one of the most raw emotional moments I heard this year.  \n\t\nThe album’s tone shares some similarities with Arnalds’ more famous countrymen Sigur Rós, and the fact that he has duplicated their sheer expansiveness of sound, and retained their balance of complexity and simplicity whilst playing and constructing everything himself is, frankly, astounding. \n\n\u000c\n###  11. Christian Scott — *Yesterday You Said Tomorrow*\n\nWhen I started getting into hip-hop in the late ‘90s, I started digging for those “important” and “classic” LPs from a jumping off point of Run DMC, Public Enemy and R.A.T.M.’s *Renegades*. But I didn’t feel properly engaged in the genre until I stumbled across a contemporary artist who blew my mind: Buck 65’s *Square* (2002) completely changed my thinking about hip-hop and made the music feel really alive to me. \n\nSo, when I started to get serious about jazz a few years back I tried from the outset to make it an equal part of my self-education in the genre to find contemporary artists. Jason Moran and Robert Glasper have both appeared on previous lists, but this year Christian Scott re-defined my ideas about what’s possible in jazz with this astounding record. \n\t\nListening back through Scott’s catalogue this isn’t a fluke: both 2006’s *Rewind That* and the following year’s *Anthem* are enormously assured and overflowing with brilliance. One listen to the latter’s opener ‘Litany Against Fear’ is all the evidence required for jazz’s contemporary vitality. \n\n*Yesterday…* however, is probably my favourite of the three, with album highlight, the achingly plaintive ‘Isadora’, standing as the most beautiful song I heard in 2010. \n\n###  10. Keith Jarrett & Charlie Haden — *Jasmine*\n\nJarrett took 14th place on last year’s list with *Yesterdays*, a record I described at the time as “not my favourite Jarrett album”, and this year he takes 10th with absolutely my favourite of his recordings that I’ve heard. \n\nJarrett’s collaboration with bassist Charlie Haden stretches back to 1967 and now numbers eight albums. Listening to *Jasmine* it’s easy to see why the two keep returning to this partnership. Jarrett’s playful, light piano swims effortlessly atop the subtle thrum of Haden’s double-bass undertow, knowing exactly when to allow the latter time to rise to the surface momentarily. The connection (as I said last year of Omar & Cedric) must be near psychic to produce something so effortlessly unified. It’s a joy to listen to and endlessly relaxing. \n\n\u000c\n###  9. Deftones — *Diamond Eyes*\n\nIt’s fifteen years since I fell under Deftones’ spell with the visceral post-punk thunder-dirge of *Adrenaline*, and a decade since they hit their peak with the heavenly *White Pony*, which remains on my list should I have to pack five albums for a desert island. \n\t\n2005’s eponymous album, whilst still solid, felt a little lacking, but they really hit their stride again with 2006’s *Saturday Night Wrist*. And then the worst happened. During recording for what was to be a back-to-basics rock record titled *Eros*, bassist Chi Cheng was hit by a car. *Eros* was shelved indefinitely and it looked for a while like Deftones had come to an end. \n\t\nCheng remains in a coma, and with *Diamond Eyes* his bandmates set out explicitly to make an album that would honour him. And what a fantastic tribute they have paid. By turns angry, beautiful, contemplative and celebratory this is their finest album in ten years and sounds not unlike *White Pony* in terms of breadth of tone and dusky, humid production style. Deftones remain a singular band, devoid of genre, possessed of limitless talent and still capable of surprising me.\n\n###  8. Broken Bells — *Broken Bells* \n\nI only really got into The Shins with 2007’s *Wincing the Night Away*, and it seems cruel to have made me wait so long for a follow-up to an album I enjoyed so much. With no sign of James Mercer getting back in the studio with the rest of his band, this will have to do for now, so it’s a good job it’s terrific. \n\t\nMercer has a very expressive voice, which, alongside his brilliant lyrics, is my favourite aspect of The Shins. It’s just as well served here by Danger Mouse’s beats, which are more melodic than some of his work (e.g. with Jemini, or arguably Gnarls Barkley); it’s perhaps closer to his production of the Sparklehorse albums and Beck’s *Modern Guilt* a couple of years ago. The lyrics and vocal performance remain the highlight for me, but the dreamy bedding of ‘Your Head is on Fire’ or the hazy synth strings of ‘Citizen’ are what hold this odd, lovable album together.\n\n###  7. Vampire Weekend — *Contra*\n\nWhere did Vampire Weekend come from? Who told them it was okay to make this twice-concentrated infectious indie-intellectual-pop with afro influences? After the 35 minutes of V.W.’s debut dominated my stereo almost exclusively for months, I remained unsure that a second album of the same kind of material would be as satisfying. What *Contra* proves is that this isn’t a gimmick, and that if you have it in you to produce more of this ultra-catchy pop music it should be mandatory that you do so. \n\t\nVampire Weekend are doing many of the same things here as they seemingly invented on their debut, but the trick isn’t worn out, it’s just as energising and refreshing as first time around. Absolutely devoid of cynicism and full to the brim with enthusiasm for life and music, this is another summer album that has proven to be great listening throughout the year. \n\n###  6. Surfer Blood — *Astro Coast*\n\nIt can’t be easy being an indie buzz band. For all of the hype-fed blog hysteria, there is (just as inevitably) the backlash. The hipsters have this down so well now that, to the average observer, the two seem almost simultaneous, leaving one unsure whether it’s cool to like Surfer Blood this week or not. \n\nBut who cares when the music is this good? I’ll admit that, perhaps as a result of buying into some of that hype, the first time I heard *Astro Coast* I made unfriendly comparisons to Vampire Weekend. Unfriendly in that they were tainted with a pinch of copycat accusation, but the more I listened to the album the weaker that connection seemed, until I now almost can’t understand how I made it in the first place. \n\t\n*Astro Coast* is a killer mix of debut album Weezer and *Pet Sounds*-era Beach Boys, with a little So-Cal punk stirred in there for good measure. The result is sunny and infectious, and if there is a Vampire Weekend comparison it’s perhaps in the music seeming completely familiar very quickly. These songs feel as though you always knew them, and any time you play them it’s summer. \n\n###  5. Charlotte Gainsbourg — *I.R.M.*\n\nI didn’t think much of Gainsbourg’s previous solo album, *5:55* (2006), but when I heard the single ‘Heaven Can Wait’ which preceded this album I knew I had to at least give the record a try. And it’s a revelation. \n\t\nThe only explanation I can find for the chasm of difference in quality between the two albums is that Gainsbourg, like a crystal, seemingly absorbs the characteristics of those around her. *5:55* had Jarvis Cocker and Air all over it, and not enjoying the work of either of those artists I was put off by its euro-poppy production and coy foppishness. \n\t\n*I.R.M.* is a different beast. It’s tonally a little darker and packed full of the kind of tunes that the first album was missing. Gainsbourg has a strong, melodic voice, and Beck (as producer here) knows just how to use it. In fact the album exhibits Beck’s influence in myriad interesting, non-obtrusive ways; so much so that it almost feels like a collaboration. It’s quirky and knowing and unafraid to explore itself, and as a result it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard in 2010.\n\n###  4. Robyn — *Body Talk*\n\nFull disclosure: Whiz has been into Robyn for some time, and if it wasn’t for her I don’t know how long it would have taken me to overcome my impression of Robyn (based on very little evidence) as just another dance starlet with little else to offer.\n\n*Body Talk* was originally released as a set of three EPs throughout the year, but Robyn helped me out in terms of list-eligibility by collating them into a single release that stands as the most energetic and fun album to occupy my headphones all year. Full of colossal glowing synth, the kind of bass that pulls you in two directions at once and some deliciously funny and caustic lyricism, this is ridiculously catchy, grade-A, thoroughbred dance-pop. \n\nIn a sea of indie and rock albums that come freighted with issues of credibility and hipness it was a pleasure to have something that did its job unquestionably by making me dance whilst I vacuumed, sing whilst I walked, and smile each and every time it came on. \n\n###  3. Buck 65 — *20 Odd Years*\n\nMuch like Robyn’s *Body Talk*, this was released as a series of four EPs throughout the year, but alas no collated album has been forthcoming. *20 Odd Years*, however, necessitates the bending of list eligibility rules as to omit it on the grounds that it was released in parts would be nothing short of a colossal tragedy (especially as a collected edition is forthcoming). \n\nThe project marks the 20th year of Buck’s hip-hop career, and its material is suitably eclectic, taking in Buck’s various guises as romantic, goofball, virtuoso etc. etc. There’s very little Buck can’t do and do well, and the mix of styles here is somewhat dizzying. Replete with multiple guest vocalists and DJs this is a riotous celebration of a unique talent, never less than absolutely riveting and almost dangerously entertaining – just like the man himself. \n\n###  2. My Chemical Romance — *Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys*\n\nIt’s been a long, almost unbearable wait since 2006’s *The Black Parade*. Four years in which MCR have broken themselves down and built themselves back up again (less one member), taken off the black clothes and swapped them for the most colourful things they could find. And what of the music? *Danger Days* sounds very little like its predecessor. In places it resembles a neon-infused version of 2004’s *Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge*; like that album the overarching concept has the protagonists on the run, and the music is infused with a dynamism arguably lacking from the majority of the more meditative *Black Parade*.\n \nPerhaps the key to the differences between the albums is in the music out of which they are grown. If *The Black Parade* was a distorted gothic version of Queen, the soil in which *Danger Days* is planted is pure Springsteen-esque Americana as seen through a caffeinated hurricane of comic book images, muscle cars, and toy laser guns. \n\t\nFrank Iero has called the album “the soundtrack to raging against the death of the creative spark”, echoing Gerard Way’s concerns about what entering his 30s meant for his art. And this does sound like a band who feel as though they have something to prove. Unquestionably they succeed in doing so. \n\n###  1. Arcade Fire — *The Suburbs*\n\nWhat’s the strongest run of three studio albums you can think of? *The Bends, OK Computer* and *Kid A*? *Off the Wall, Thriller* and *Bad*? *Master of Puppets, …And Justice for All* and *Metallica*? \n\nWhich band / artist has the best set of three studio albums to *start* their career? Nirvana? Björk? Deftones? Bloc Party? Foo Fighters?\n\nArcade Fire are undoubtedly something special. In an era that has seen the decline of the physical format and where “shuffle” has become the predominant listening experience, they are a quintessential album band. They are forthright and outspoken in their political convictions; indefatigable in their touring schedule; meticulous in their standards of quality. In the 44 tracks that make up their three albums and one EP to date there is not one weak song. \n\t\n*The Suburbs* is a remarkable achievement in and of itself: a beautiful, thoughtful record of songs full of longing and loss, love and loneliness and a pursuit of meaning. Its influences—as with the band’s previous albums—come from the middle of the North American radio dial, and no band is able to make that music seem so shiningly vital as Arcade Fire do on track after track. \n\nThe most insightful commentary I’ve seen on the album reads it as part of a trilogy. The feeling of longing to leave home, which is present on *Funeral* (particularly the ‘Neighborhood’ tracks) is mirrored in the return here of an older and wiser narrative voice to the place of its youth. *Neon Bible*, which sits in the middle as the record of worldly experience is noticeably darker and more preoccupied with menacing themes. *The Suburbs* sounds more comfortable and reflective by comparison, but is just as emotionally wrought in its own way. \n\t\nIt’s a stunning collection of songs, somehow living up to the astronomical expectations with which I awaited it; it also stands as further confirmation that Arcade Fire are the most consistently inspired and inspiring band recording today. Thom, Jonny *et al*: the ball is in your court.  \n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; color: #cfcfcf;\">• • •</div> \n\n###  Appendices \n\nPutting this thing together was harder this year than maybe any year I can remember. A lot of great music missed out on a coveted top 20 spot and it’s only right that I make room for a couple of honourable mentions:\n\nFirst and foremost, Glassjaw have been drip-feeding new material through one at a time YouTube videos and digital downloads and it’s mindblowing – a full album must follow in 2011 for the sake of my sanity.\n\nLiars’ *Sisterworld* should by all rights have made this list. Along with Battles, who sadly split with Tyondai Braxton this year; they’re one of the most consistently innovative bands on my radar. \n\nPolar Bear’s *Peepers* was another contemporary jazz find that got quite a lot of play – super funky and very playful. \n\n*The Monitor* by Titus Andronicus missed out by virtue of being more admirable than enjoyable, but still certainly warrants a mention. \n\nAs does Wolf Parade who, in *Expo 86*, made perhaps their most accessible LP to date. \n\nThe return of Far was cause for much celebration by me, but in the end, despite having one of the year’s best opening tracks in ‘Deafening’, *At Night We Live* didn’t quite manage to live up to the expectation.\n\nPure Reason Revolution’s *Hammer & Anvil* somehow failed to grab me, perhaps because it came out relatively late in the year, and the same can be said for Warpaint’s debut *The Fool* and The Mynabirds’ *What We Lose in the Fire we Gain in the Flood*, both of which I only recently discovered and have been playing a lot – these may sneak onto The List if the year was a month longer. \n\nEven in the best of musical years there have to be a couple of disappointments and it feels worth noting a few here: \n\nThe continued decline of Weezer is a source of great dismay, thrown into even greater contrast by bands like Surfer Blood making the sort of music Weezer used to be capable of. \n\nThe M.I.A. record was a similar disappointment after much anticipation, and Jimmy Eat World turned in a pretty lackluster effort – outdone at their own game by The Posies.\n\t\nThere were a number of interesting release strategies this year. As well as Robyn and Buck 65 choosing multiple EPs over the album format, there was Ash releasing one song every two weeks (the standard was pretty high too), Girl Talk and Gorillaz giving music away, and Smashing Pumpkins putting out a song every now and again from what Mr. Corgan promises will be a 44 track collection! \n\nOff the top of my head and resisting the urge to overthink, these are my songs of the year in no particular order:\n\n• Robyn ‘Fembot’  \n• My Chemical Romance ‘Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na)’  \n• Far ‘Deafening’  \n• Charlotte Gainsbourg ‘Heaven Can Wait’  \n• Laura Marling ‘Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)’  \n• Arcade Fire ‘City With No Children’  \n• The Mynabirds ‘What We Gained in the Fire’  \n• The Posies ‘For The Ashes’  \n• Christian Scott ‘Isadora’  \n• Deftones ‘Rocket Skates’  \n• Ólafur Arnalds ‘Hægt, kemur ljósið’  \n\nAnd looking forward to the new year the albums which immediately come to mind as my most anticipated are by Glassjaw, Cold War Kids, Radiohead, Silverchair, Metallica, The Decemberists, Foo Fighters (?), Laura Marling and Beastie Boys. \n\nBring on 2011.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #cfcfcf;\">⏎ Return to the <metaa>[index of lists](/thelists)</metaa></span>\n",

				"title": "Tron: Legacy dir. Joseph Kosinski (2010)",
				"content_html": "<p>Sometime during the hype-storm that preceded the release of <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> in 2003, I saw a preview video in which one of the film&rsquo;s producers advised the potential audience to &ldquo;read your Kant&rdquo;. Though it was a faintly ridiculous thing to say, and came from a man I had a hard time believing cared what people read as long as they paid to see the movie, it was another example of how invested The Matrix franchise was in the idea of the philosophically rich blockbuster. (See also the inclusion on the DVDs of a commentary track dedicated entirely to discussing the philosophy behind the films.)</p>\n<p>The extent to which, particularly with the second and third films of the trilogy, the Wachowskis succeeded in building a story that meets their goal is still debated, but the fact that the goal existed is irrefutable. The nature of reality; the relationship between creator and creation; the existence of free will&hellip; these considerations and more are interwoven into the Wachowskis' story at such a basic level that it&rsquo;s easy to believe that they provided the inspiration for telling the story.</p>\n<p><em>Tron</em> (1982) however, came about because director Steven Lisberger was fascinated by <em>Pong</em>.

Joseph Kosinski&rsquo;s sequel is a different story. Wasting no time in getting his protagonist zapped out of the physical world and into the virtual one, the pace rarely lets up once Sam Flynn is neon-suited and thrown straight out onto the game grid having been told merely to &ldquo;survive&rdquo;.

Clu, though his actions are villainous, is in fact motivated purely by his creator&rsquo;s original instruction: to make &ldquo;a perfect system&rdquo;. To do so he instills order at any cost and eradicates imperfection wherever he finds it.

Clu, as the unbounded version of Flynn&rsquo;s younger self, presides over a nightmarish dictatorship of virtual clones.

				"content_text": "Sometime during the hype-storm that preceded the release of *The Matrix Reloaded* in 2003, I saw a preview video in which one of the film's producers advised the potential audience to \"read your Kant\". Though it was a faintly ridiculous thing to say, and came from a man I had a hard time believing cared what people read as long as they paid to see the movie, it was another example of how invested The Matrix franchise was in the idea of the philosophically rich blockbuster. (See also the inclusion on the DVDs of a commentary track dedicated entirely to discussing the philosophy behind the films.)\n\nThe extent to which, particularly with the second and third films of the trilogy, the Wachowskis succeeded in building a story that meets their goal is still debated, but the fact that the goal existed is irrefutable. The nature of reality; the relationship between creator and creation; the existence of free will... these considerations and more are interwoven into the Wachowskis' story at such a basic level that it's easy to believe that they provided the inspiration for telling the story.\n\n*Tron* (1982) however, came about because director Steven Lisberger was fascinated by *Pong*. It's a humble genesis, and the movie it produced, whilst still thoroughly entertaining, hasn't aged well. Viewing it now for the first time, without the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia, it must be difficult to understand why it is so beloved, and why it was hailed as such a revolutionary method of film-making. Reading accounts of the film's production (such as the one in the Nov / Dec 2010 issue of *Little White Lies*, or the excellent article in the January 2011 issue of *Empire*) I was reminded of nothing more than of those reports from the 'set' of *Avatar*: all those effusive remarks about what the advent of a purely virtual shooting environment would mean for the future of cinema; how it was now possible to create something almost entirely in post-production.\n\nThe original *Tron* is a romp. Its pace is surprisingly slow, but not because the characters stop to ponder the philosophical meaning behind their circumstances, just because that's the pace of a family adventure story shot in the '80s without the crutch of C.G. to up its whizzbang quota.

				"title": "Tao Lin — Richard Yates (2010)",
				"content_html": "<p>Tao Lin’s new novel <em>Richard Yates</em> is by turns frustratingly literal, genuinely insightful, monotonous, charming, plain-faced and sweet. At a little over 200 pages it really only allows room for two characters: Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning (with the latter’s mother occasionally appearing at the periphery), and concerns itself equally with the minutiae of their days and the complexities of their relationship.</p>\n<p>Appropriating the names of child actors is just one of many layers of non sequitur Lin employs, arguably starting with the novel’s title. Yates’ work is mentioned on occasion, and it is arguable that Lin is concerned here with some themes similar to those found in the late writer’s stories; just as likely however is that the title and character names, like the cover image, were chosen to exacerbate that feeling of disconnection from which Lin’s characters suffer and with which Lin’s readers are inculcated to empathise. The connections between things here are uncertain, the gravity of cause and effect feels loosened somehow so that the reader feels simultaneously as though floating, ungrounded in the world of Lin’s creation, and swept on by its rhythm and momentum.</p>\n<p>The novel is not without plot, and indeed it is a great deal more concrete than the plots found in some of the author’s previous work. Stylistically <em>Richard Yates</em> bears more resemblance to Lin’s 2009 novella <em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em> than it does to his previous novel, <em>Eeeee Eee Eeee</em> (2007). In an interview with Brandon Tietz, Lin explains his effort towards a more “concrete / literal prose style” for <em>Richard Yates</em>. He gives examples of how a sentence might have appeared differently from one novel to the next:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Mike got out of the car” in [<em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em>] would be “Mike left the car” in [<em>Richard Yates</em>] due to “got out” not being literal and being more words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a page from an earlier draft of the novel in which you can see Lin in the process of making these alterations. In the margin he notes that a sentence could be more economically conveyed as dialogue, or strikes through extraneous reportage and notes &ldquo;Boring&rdquo;. These slight differences fit with the overall trend away from magical surrealism in Lin’s work over the last couple of years, but <em>Richard Yates</em> still retains moments of Coen-esque unreality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My brother emailed me,” said Haley Joel Osment. “He wants to pay me money to live in Connecticut for two weeks to potty train his and his girlfriend’s French bulldog Babo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like much of the novel it would be wrong to read the above with what Lin would call a “neutral facial expression” and yet it’s couched within the context of quite a tense exchange, and is followed, five lines later, by a threat of suicide. Also in the aforementioned interview Lin says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My books that don’t have concretely surreal elements usually feel surreal to me in tone. Real life often seems “dreamlike” to me. I like viewing real life as a dream. I like writing about it as if it were a dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lin’s detractors often criticise his one-note narrative style and his monotonous pacing, but these stylistic elements are also enormously challenging for the reader, who finds themself without the usual crutch of the author indicating to them how to feel. Lin’s style is artfully and meticulously constructed from elements of realism, minimalism, and reportage; seeming to give equal weight to wildly disparate narrative strands it asks the reader to assess relative importance for himself. This is made no easier by the fact that there are a number of fascinating dualities at the heart of Lin’s style: concrete v surrealist; surface detail v interiority; the specific v the vague. Whilst one might consider an economy of words to be one hallmark of Lin’s style, he is also fond of functionless detail, repetition and, in <em>Richard Yates</em>, unfailing use of the characters’ full names. Where he is generous with description it is most often on the level of volume rather than depth: details take precedence over insight, the reader again left to fend for themselves in parsing them. Which isn’t to say that there is objective, capital-M “Meaning” to be found. In a 2007 email to Gawker, Lin writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though all meaning is arbitrary it can still be used as a tool just like arbitrary rules can be created to make life “better.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This feels demonstrably true in Lin’s fiction. Nothing is given the weight one might expect an author to lend the “message” of his work – you might argue <em>Richard Yates</em> is a novel about loneliness, about discordance in relationships, about forms of communication and miscommunication, about any number of things. If you can resist the temptation to seek meaning however, there is enough enjoyment to be had in getting lost in the novel’s rich seam of detail and gathered up by the tempo of Lin’s prose.</p>\n<p>In his ‘Ugly Fish Poem’ (from the 2008 collection <em>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</em>) Lin writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i have wilfully and simultaneously subjected myself to multiple irreconcilable philosophies</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that, by treating all things equally in terms of prose tone, Lin allows for the possibility that all things are of equal importance. It is an interesting exercise to approach his novel with this philosophy in mind, and to find that a catalog of petty shoplifting, instant messenger conversations and relationship strife is perfectly capable of subtlety, nuance and indirectly expressed depths of feeling.</p>\n",

These slight differences fit with the overall trend away from magical surrealism in Lin’s work over the last couple of years, but *Richard Yates* still retains moments of Coen-esque unreality:\n\n> “My brother emailed me,” said Haley Joel Osment. “He wants to pay me money to live in Connecticut for two weeks to potty train his and his girlfriend’s French bulldog Babo.\n\nLike much of the novel it would be wrong to read the above with what Lin would call a “neutral facial expression” and yet it’s couched within the context of quite a tense exchange, and is followed, five lines later, by a threat of suicide. Also in the aforementioned interview Lin says:\n\n> My books that don’t have concretely surreal elements usually feel surreal to me in tone. Real life often seems “dreamlike” to me. I like viewing real life as a dream. I like writing about it as if it were a dream.\n\nLin’s detractors often criticise his one-note narrative style and his monotonous pacing, but these stylistic elements are also enormously challenging for the reader, who finds themself without the usual crutch of the author indicating to them how to feel. Lin’s style is artfully and meticulously constructed from elements of realism, minimalism, and reportage; seeming to give equal weight to wildly disparate narrative strands it asks the reader to assess relative importance for himself. This is made no easier by the fact that there are a number of fascinating dualities at the heart of Lin’s style: concrete v surrealist; surface detail v interiority; the specific v the vague. Whilst one might consider an economy of words to be one hallmark of Lin’s style, he is also fond of functionless detail, repetition and, in *Richard Yates*, unfailing use of the characters’ full names. Where he is generous with description it is most often on the level of volume rather than depth: details take precedence over insight, the reader again left to fend for themselves in parsing them. Which isn’t to say that there is objective, capital-M “Meaning” to be found. In a 2007 email to Gawker, Lin writes:\n\n> Though all meaning is arbitrary it can still be used as a tool just like arbitrary rules can be created to make life “better.”\n\nThis feels demonstrably true in Lin’s fiction. Nothing is given the weight one might expect an author to lend the “message” of his work – you might argue *Richard Yates* is a novel about loneliness, about discordance in relationships, about forms of communication and miscommunication, about any number of things. If you can resist the temptation to seek meaning however, there is enough enjoyment to be had in getting lost in the novel’s rich seam of detail and gathered up by the tempo of Lin’s prose.\n\nIn his ‘Ugly Fish Poem’ (from the 2008 collection *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy*) Lin writes:\n\n> i have wilfully and simultaneously subjected myself to multiple irreconcilable philosophies\n\nIt seems that, by treating all things equally in terms of prose tone, Lin allows for the possibility that all things are of equal importance. It is an interesting exercise to approach his novel with this philosophy in mind, and to find that a catalog of petty shoplifting, instant messenger conversations and relationship strife is perfectly capable of subtlety, nuance and indirectly expressed depths of feeling.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Nicholson Baker is one of my favourite novelists: witty, observant and capable of conjuring magic out of any overlooked facet of life that he turns his attention to. Baker’s piece on videogames in this week’s <em>New Yorker</em> (abstracted <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/09/100809fa_fact_baker\">here</a>) is characteristically insightful and treats the subject with a light touch, but reading it I felt the swell of defensiveness which rises in any hobbyist when their pastime comes under scrutiny by an outsider: Baker was missing the point. Baker’s report from the front line of gaming exposes the running themes of killing and dying in a manner which makes the gamer in me faintly ashamed. Judged like for like it’s hard to argue against the prevalence of death in gaming even over and above its centrality in cinema; even Sylvester Stallone’s back catalogue contains a body count which would appear meagre when put next to 90 accumulated hours of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> multiplayer. In large part I think this is due to an integral aspect of games with which no other media needs concern itself: challenge.</p>\n<p>There is &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; music, there are difficult films, and there are certainly difficult books, but their difficulties are qualitatively different to that of games. When watching a film or reading a book the level of perceived difficulty is no barrier to continuation. The experience may seem less enjoyable or less rewarding, but you can still turn the pages, the DVD doesn’t start skipping if you lose track of the plot. Even in the case of solo play, games are a conversation happening in real time: a push and pull between the gamer and the game’s AI.</p>\n<p>Gaming is, in large part, about challenge, and if you’re unable to meet the requirements for success you cannot continue. Baker notes the length of games, the 30+ hours put into making your way through an interactive narrative, and all of that time is accrued in overcoming obstacles. It just so happens that survival is a wonderfully clear-cut challenge, and character death the simplest way both to communicate to a player that their skills need work and to increase the game’s longevity. Thirty years since Atari’s <em>Asteroids</em> posed the challenge of keeping a little triangle in one piece by avoiding and destroying crude wire-frame rocks; thirty years also since players struggled to guide <em>Pac-Man</em> around mazes in search of power pellets, which would allow him to destroy ghosts before they could destroy him, game designers are yet to find a challenge as inspiring as avoiding death, or a thrill as basic as being the one to mete it out first. As the industry has grown and visual fidelity has increased exponentially the depiction of violence has undoubtedly grown more vivid and gratuitous, but death itself is part of some games for good reason.</p>\n<p>Gaming of course, is a broad church. Uncountable games in a plethora of genres offer an experience entirely free of the obligation to kill or the fear of dying. Puzzle games, including the perennially popular <em>Tetris</em> (possibly gaming’s greatest success story to date) pose a challenge of an entirely different kind. Photo hunts, role playing games, management simulations (including wildly popular Facebook games like <em>Farmville</em>), sports simulations, platformers&hellip; all shift the balance away from the kill or be killed dynamic. And that is perhaps the shame of Baker’s piece; guided by his 16 year old son into playing only the biggest selling triple-A titles of the last year or so Baker has missed a great swathe of what games are capable of. It’s roughly analogous to watching <em>Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Twilight: Eclipse</em>, and considering that a representative sample of modern cinema. The shame is less that Baker falls into this trap — he is quite clear that his investigation is of his son’s gaming habits — but that it robs us of his thoughts on other games in which he might find more to like. An article in which Nicholson Baker plays through Jason Rohrer’s interactive memento mori <em>Passage</em>, or gets involved on either side of the story-telling game <em>Sleep Is Death</em> would be fascinating. Personally I would love to know Baker’s impression of Molleindustria’s <em>Every Day The Same Dream</em> or Amanita Design’s charming <em>Machinarium</em>.</p>\n<p>All of this isn’t to decry Baker’s article. In it, and in the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/out-loud/nicholson-baker-examines-video-games\">podcast</a>, he is receptive to the idea of games as an art-form and is positively effusive about the beauty to be found in some of the constructed worlds with which he interacted. He praises the designers’ desire to “pay homage” to the real world - but that cannot be a game designer’s only goal, she must also busy herself with the effort to provide the player with an entertaining struggle. Part of loving an art form, and perhaps especially one still in its infancy, is wanting it to be viewed in a positive light. Baker does a wonderful job of appreciating detail in the games he played, but seems quick to write off their core as facile, trivial and blood-soaked. He may be right. In many ways gaming is going through an adolescence, with the first generation to have grown up playing games all of their lives now moving into positions of power within the industry. In time perhaps the predisposition towards violence will drop away and more nuanced stories can be told. Arguably this is beginning to happen already, and as it does hopefully more commentators of Baker’s calibre will discover that instead of merely base and bloodthirsty and brutal, games can be engaging and subtle and beautiful.</p>\n",

				"title": "Exposed @ Tate Modern",
				"content_html": "<p>Looking down from Tate Modern’s first floor balcony you can see the scar left by Doris Salcedo’s 2007 exhibit <em>Shibboleth</em>, a lightning strike of new concrete which runs the length of the vast Turbine Hall. Perched up here you could happily spend a great deal of time watching people coming in from the rain and negotiating the hall’s gentle slope. Though currently empty the room still has the power to elicit a response. Children run and skip when they get through the doors, people are sat against walls eating their lunch, and here and there bodies are sprawled on the floor as people stare up at the steel-girder ceiling. This is part of what Tate Modern has brought to London in the ten years since it opened: an inviting public space in which to encounter visual art, and the idea that art-appreciation shouldn’t be solely the province of small, intimidating, elitist galleries. As one of 5 million visitors per year you are afforded both the chance to view some spectacular modern art, and the chance to observe other people doing the same.</p>\n<p>The latest exhibition to take up residence on Tate Modern’s fourth floor, <em>Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance &amp; the Camera</em>, combines these ideas of art and people-watching, and challenges us to reconsider where the boundaries might lie. Over five thematic sections through more than a dozen rooms the visitor is presented with images which raise questions of intent, privacy, security and eroticism.</p>\n<p>Entering the first room of the exhibition you’re met with enlargements of shots from Philip-Lorca diCorcia’s series <em>Heads</em>. The images were taken from a great distance when pedestrians in New York unwittingly tripped automatic lights diCorcia rigged on the sidewalk. The text accompanying the photos tells you that one of the artist’s subjects took legal action against him, with the court eventually ruling in diCorcia’s favour. By choosing to present this material first it feels like the exhibition’s curators are tipping their hand in the voyeurism vs art debate that plays out over the following rooms. In the rest of the ‘Unseen Photographer’ section we’re shown images taken through buttonhole cameras (neatly presented in circular frames) and one-way mirrors, and introduced to the technology of the ‘lateral viewfinder’, positioned at a right angle to the camera’s true lens to allow for surreptitious ‘sideways’ photography.</p>\n<p>By sequencing ‘Celebrity &amp; the Public Gaze’ as the next section the visitor is asked to consider whether the rules are - or should be - different for the famous. The curators have performed a careful balancing act, leaving the question open for the visitor. On one wall there are several of Ron Galella’s photos of Jackie Kennedy, one (&lsquo;What makes Jackie Run&rsquo;) in which she is actively fleeing the photographer. On an adjoining wall Marilyn Monroe’s dress billows as she poses atop an air vent. The fact of the subjects’ celebrity brings a unique push and pull to the relationship between photographer and photographed and challenges us to separate public and private personae. The vibrant candid shot of Jack Nicholson which dominates one wall shows him swinging a golf club at the car of a driver who had just cut him up. There is a strange ‘in-character’ element to the image and it takes effort to see it as something other than a movie screenshot.</p>\n<p>The next two sections are the exhibition’s most challenging, and form a duologue of two big themes: sex &amp; death. It’s not so much the explicit nature of the images within ‘Voyeurism &amp; Desire’ that sets you on edge, as much as the element of illicitness in their having been taken and now in their being displayed. I felt acutely aware of the people around me through these rooms, and watching others’ efforts to appear to be appreciating this art in an acceptable manner added an enjoyable meta-level to the exhibition’s central themes. This section also contained some of the most striking images, and two exceptional pieces of hanging: selections from Merry Alpern’s <em>Dirty Windows</em> series presented in four rows and three columns evoking a grid of windows in a tower block; and the frankly creepy shots from Kohei Yoshiyuki’s 1971 infrared series <em>The Park</em> individually illuminated by spotlights in a darkened corridor.</p>\n<p>‘Witnessing Violence’ develops another human preoccupation in similarly captivating fashion. In amongst the obligatory stills from the Zapruder film Oliver Lutz has found a way to place the observer within the image. A large black canvas hangs alone on one wall, its image only revealed when the viewer looks at a monitor positioned nearby so as to frame them directly in front of the picture. The technique, which involves covering the photograph in infrared sensitive pigment is perhaps a little gimmicky but nevertheless impactful as another way of making the visitor reassess their relationship with the images on display.</p>\n<p>The final section, &lsquo;Surveillance&rsquo;, is perhaps the weakest. The divide between viewer and subject is increased, the images are often of lesser resolution and there is a detectable lack of human engagement in their making. These are largely pictures taken automatically, or single frames from an automated recording; simply in terms of composition, colouration and focus you can tell that there is not a human interest overseeing their manufacture. As a result I felt detachment from these last photographs where the majority of what had preceded had engaged me.</p>\n<p>Throughout the exhibition I sensed a lack of interest in narrative. The images on display were taken quickly or secretly or both, with the aim being to capture a single, true moment. The act of doing this removes that moment from its context and allows the viewer to wrap their own story around it. Every invasion of privacy with which we are confronted is simultaneously an invasion of our privacy and our invasion of someone else’s. Each image of violence invites us to imagine ourselves as victim, perpetrator and onlooker. In some cases, where a set of photos from the same series is presented, a story does begin to take shape - such as that in Enrique Metrinides’ &lsquo;Suicide Rescue from the Top of the Toreo Stadium&rsquo; - but even in these instances the narrative is abstract and incomplete. In this sense the exhibition demands every bit as much work on the part of the viewer as some of the ‘difficult’ abstract and impressionist work in the Tate’s permanent collection.

				"title": "The Breaking Down of the Desktop Analogy",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ncroal\">N’Gai Croal</a> is one of those smart guys that you just know you should listen to regardless of the topic at hand. He knows tech, he knows videogames, he knows basketball&hellip;. Occasionally though Croal will come out with something even more insightful than usual.</p>\n<p>Before I cut back on my podcast consumption I used to listen to Croal in conversation every week on Out Of The Game; essentially the show is a group of friends, formerly or currently employed within or around the games industry, talking about anything that comes to their minds - though often it’s web or tech related. During one of the episodes Croal started talking about the file / folder structure of how we understand computing, how that design is predicated on an analogy of the computer as a desk, and how he thought the usefulness of that idea had expired. It seemed like the kind of idea that was underpinning a lot of the digital culture advancements and new technologies, but that I hadn’t actually seen spelled out anywhere.</p>\n<p>I spend a lot of time organising my digital content. Just as my bookshelves are alphabetised at home, I’m fastidious about making sure that everything’s correctly titled, labelled, tagged, and filed. I’m that guy you know who looks at your iPod and just shakes his head at how you have multiple artist entries for R.E.M., R.E.M and REM. I’m the one who makes little noises of disapproval because you have tracks just listed as ‘Track 1’, and some of your albums are missing artwork. Seriously, I’ll actually sigh if you’ve got solo artists alphabetised by forename just because you choose not to spend hours of your life completing the ‘Sort By’ field in iTunes.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of rules for iTunes:</p>\n<p>• Artist alphabetically by Surname, or band name disregarding ‘The’<br>\n• Albums chronologically by release date (re-issues filed under release of original album)<br>\n• Guest artists listed in square brackets within the song title, prefaced by ‘ft.’ (ie Song Title [ft. Guest Artist])<br>\n• Square brackets for remix suffixes (ie Song Title [Mix Title])</p>\n<p>&hellip;and on and on and on. These are rules I’ve developed over the course of years using the program to organise my digital music. Sometimes I’ll come up with a rule, or Apple will change the software to make something new possible, and I will have to spend <em>literally hours</em> making sure the change is applied uniformly to my entire library. It’s not easy being a pedant, but you do get a very clean-looking, easily navigable iPod out of it.</p>\n<p>The problem is that not all systems are as flexible, and every system is different. Take Google for example; I tend to use a lot of Google applications in my every day life, Gmail and Google Docs chief amongst them. I like a clean inbox, and with Gmail’s huge amount of storage space and archiving function I can easily keep anything I’m not dealing with immediately, out of my way. Anything that’s dealt with I archive, anything that needs to be dealt with by me I keep in the inbox, and anything I’m waiting to hear back on I add a star to and archive. Then there are labels - the big difference between Gmail and its competitors (including Hotmail, from which I switched) was labelling emails instead of placing them in folders. I used to spend a lot of time on labels: wording and ordering them correctly; choosing colours that suit and making sure the colours were distinct enough from one another; making sure to apply at least one to emails I’d need again, but not too many as that felt like it defeated the object.</p>\n<p>Now consider Google Docs, a super-useful way to move all my documents and files to the cloud and have them at my fingertips to edit anywhere. Docs was a revelation when it launched, but I quickly started to wonder why we were back to the language of ‘folders’ instead of ‘labels’, and the ‘Hide’ function was simply confusing at first. Docs is essentially using the same model as Gmail. ‘All Documents’ is an inbox, folders are essentially labels (in that you can store a single copy of a file in multiple folders), and ‘Hide’ performs the same function as ‘Archive’. What allows this model to work for email as well as documents, spreadsheets and various other kinds of files is Google’s powerful search functionality. Click ‘Show Search Options’ in the top bar of either Gmail or Docs and you’re presented with a remarkably similar box with various fields that will allow you to find any of your material.</p>\n<p>This is the breaking down of the desktop analogy. The idea that N’Gai Croal spoke about is that when computers were first mass-produced they were based around a model that was familiar to their prospective purchasers: the desk. Each piece of data was a ‘file’ you could place within ‘folders’ and keep those in other ‘folders’ as you saw fit. This simple system allowed you to feel like you were in control of your data and find it again quickly when required. As the volume of data and the types of files grew (and it grew exponentially – <em>exploded</em> really) the model struggled to keep up. If you had photos, video, written documents and maybe even audio all related to one project, you suddenly had to decide whether to file content away by type or by context.

				"content_text": "[N’Gai Croal](https://www.twitter.com/ncroal) is one of those smart guys that you just know you should listen to regardless of the topic at hand. He knows tech, he knows videogames, he knows basketball.... Occasionally though Croal will come out with something even more insightful than usual.\n \nBefore I cut back on my podcast consumption I used to listen to Croal in conversation every week on Out Of The Game; essentially the show is a group of friends, formerly or currently employed within or around the games industry, talking about anything that comes to their minds - though often it’s web or tech related. During one of the episodes Croal started talking about the file / folder structure of how we understand computing, how that design is predicated on an analogy of the computer as a desk, and how he thought the usefulness of that idea had expired. It seemed like the kind of idea that was underpinning a lot of the digital culture advancements and new technologies, but that I hadn’t actually seen spelled out anywhere.\n\nI spend a lot of time organising my digital content. Just as my bookshelves are alphabetised at home, I’m fastidious about making sure that everything’s correctly titled, labelled, tagged, and filed. I’m that guy you know who looks at your iPod and just shakes his head at how you have multiple artist entries for R.E.M., R.E.M and REM. I’m the one who makes little noises of disapproval because you have tracks just listed as ‘Track 1’, and some of your albums are missing artwork. Seriously, I’ll actually sigh if you’ve got solo artists alphabetised by forename just because you choose not to spend hours of your life completing the ‘Sort By’ field in iTunes.\n\nI have a lot of rules for iTunes:\n\n• Artist alphabetically by Surname, or band name disregarding ‘The’  \n• Albums chronologically by release date (re-issues filed under release of original album)  \n• Guest artists listed in square brackets within the song title, prefaced by ‘ft.’ (ie Song Title [ft. Guest Artist])  \n• Square brackets for remix suffixes (ie Song Title [Mix Title])  \n\n...and on and on and on. These are rules I’ve developed over the course of years using the program to organise my digital music. Sometimes I’ll come up with a rule, or Apple will change the software to make something new possible, and I will have to spend *literally hours* making sure the change is applied uniformly to my entire library. It’s not easy being a pedant, but you do get a very clean-looking, easily navigable iPod out of it.\n\nThe problem is that not all systems are as flexible, and every system is different. Take Google for example; I tend to use a lot of Google applications in my every day life, Gmail and Google Docs chief amongst them. I like a clean inbox, and with Gmail’s huge amount of storage space and archiving function I can easily keep anything I’m not dealing with immediately, out of my way. Anything that’s dealt with I archive, anything that needs to be dealt with by me I keep in the inbox, and anything I’m waiting to hear back on I add a star to and archive. Then there are labels - the big difference between Gmail and its competitors (including Hotmail, from which I switched) was labelling emails instead of placing them in folders. I used to spend a lot of time on labels: wording and ordering them correctly; choosing colours that suit and making sure the colours were distinct enough from one another; making sure to apply at least one to emails I’d need again, but not too many as that felt like it defeated the object.\n\nNow consider Google Docs, a super-useful way to move all my documents and files to the cloud and have them at my fingertips to edit anywhere. Docs was a revelation when it launched, but I quickly started to wonder why we were back to the language of ‘folders’ instead of ‘labels’, and the ‘Hide’ function was simply confusing at first. Docs is essentially using the same model as Gmail. ‘All Documents’ is an inbox, folders are essentially labels (in that you can store a single copy of a file in multiple folders), and ‘Hide’ performs the same function as ‘Archive’. What allows this model to work for email as well as documents, spreadsheets and various other kinds of files is Google’s powerful search functionality. Click ‘Show Search Options’ in the top bar of either Gmail or Docs and you’re presented with a remarkably similar box with various fields that will allow you to find any of your material.\n\nThis is the breaking down of the desktop analogy. The idea that N’Gai Croal spoke about is that when computers were first mass-produced they were based around a model that was familiar to their prospective purchasers: the desk. Each piece of data was a ‘file’ you could place within ‘folders’ and keep those in other ‘folders’ as you saw fit. This simple system allowed you to feel like you were in control of your data and find it again quickly when required. As the volume of data and the types of files grew (and it grew exponentially – *exploded* really) the model struggled to keep up. If you had photos, video, written documents and maybe even audio all related to one project, you suddenly had to decide whether to file content away by type or by context. You could duplicate the file of course, and store a copy in two places, but this caused two problems: firstly, it was easy to change one copy of a file and neglect to alter the rest, thereby fracturing your content; and secondly, doing so destroyed the idea of organising your content like material on a desk.\n\nGoogle attacked the idea of multiple ‘copies’ of a document with Wave (wherein a single version of a document is collaborated on in real time) and with similar live-editing and collaboration functionality in their Docs suite. But to my mind it’s another of Google’s products that has finally rendered the desktop analogy next to useless: search itself. Those previously mentioned search boxes in Docs and Gmail allow me to find any file or email as long as I remember even the slightest detail about it, such as a word that it contains. Obviously the more I recall the better, as I can quickly make my search more specific: I can look for messages from a specific sender, containing a particular phrase and sent within a given time period, all with a few simple operator commands.\n\nAnd the approach doesn’t only apply online. It bears pointing out that Microsoft’s Windows 7 has a greatly improved ‘Search’ function, which proves very good at pulling up all kinds of content very quickly with even the slightest of search strings. And it is perhaps telling that there is a ‘Search’ field built into pretty much every system window you open in the OS.\n\nFor someone as pedantic as myself it takes a lot to let go of the idea that I’m not better off meticulously labelling, filing, and sub-filing my content. But as hitting ‘Archive’ and learning to make better use of search becomes equally effective I find myself drawn more towards that way of working.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It is Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s birthday. When I think about my favourite directors the names that come to mind tend to be people with long and varied filmographies, and Van Sant&rsquo;s name is right near the top of that list. You look through his back catalogue and you can&rsquo;t help being impressed with the sheer volume of creative work he&rsquo;s produced, not to mention the quality of it.</p>\n<p>I think I first became aware of Van Sant&rsquo;s name in relation to his 1998 remake of <em>Psycho</em>. I was a lover of the Hitchcock original and I went to see the film in the cinema. I remember through most of the movie being captivated by just how slavishly Van Sant had copied the decades-old classic and even though the film is far from his best work it marked him out to me as someone whose love of film shines through on screen.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think at that time I was aware that it was Van Sant behind the camera for <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (1997); all of the conversation surrounding that film had been about Damon &amp; Afflek and I probably assumed that it was a studio director-for-hire who had been brought in to shoot it. There&rsquo;s no doubting the film is well made, but it&rsquo;s the script and the performances that are doing the heavy lifting; supporting evidence came a couple of years later when Van Sant essentially tried to make the same film again in the form of <em>Finding Forrester</em> (2000) with lesser results. These studio films pay the bills; they&rsquo;re cinematically pleasant enough and clearly put together by someone with good instincts, but Van Sant only really shines when he&rsquo;s free of their constraints.</p>\n<p>Once the name was known to me I went back and watched some of the earlier work and it was clear that this was a director who didn&rsquo;t belong in the studio system. His camera likes to linger and wander, scenes play out un-rushed, characters mumble and shuffle, often Van Sant movies are not pretty but they are stylistically flawless. When <em>Elephant</em> (2003) came out it seemed to me to be a singular artistic statement which expressed in one stroke a whole swathe of pent-up, suppressed and otherwise inexpressible thoughts and feelings that had been bubbling under the western liberal psyche since those twin millennium-straddling events: the Columbine high school shootings of 1999 and the attacks on New York and Washington DC in September 2001. The subject matter of the film is obviously more closely modelled on the former, but as someone who was moving into adulthood at the time of those events I remember a distinct feeling of things slipping, getting worse, and a confusion that went with it. Somehow Van Sant got that on film; he captured something which other artists in all mediums were finding elusive. <em>Elephant</em> feels to me talismanic in some way, a coherent expression of something inexpressible, comparable to the relationship of Picasso&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guernica&rsquo; to the Spanish Civil War.</p>\n<p>On a more personal level I had no particular desire to see the story of Kurt Cobain&rsquo;s suicide put up on screen, but Van Sant&rsquo;s 2005 film <em>Last Days</em> is touching, poignant, thoughtful and respectful in perfect measure. That lingering camera is the tool of a director who trusts his actors, and Van Sant&rsquo;s confidence provides the film with a measured pace that gives the viewer opportunity to reflect whilst watching. Some directors work their entire lives trying to make sure that thought is the last thing inspired in their audience when the movie is still rolling, it takes great confidence in one&rsquo;s abilities before one is willing to let the viewer have his own space within the film.

Both films are perhaps difficult to watch in parts, but enormously rewarding.</p>\n<p>Gus Van Sant is one of film&rsquo;s true auteurs, and yet he has been smart enough to make films that have added stability and longevity to his career. 2008&rsquo;s Oscar-winning <em>Milk</em> seems in some ways to be a perfect fusion of the two halves of Van Sant&rsquo;s back catalogue: a deeply personal film made with studio-backing and an eye on the awards season. That it succeeded on every level and in all senses of the word is completely deserved for such a fantastic film-maker.</p>\n",

In the set’s final minutes he places three upturned hand cymbals on the snare and adds to the work he’s doing with his left hand on the ride cymbal a completely different and absolutely complimentary right-handed rhythm. This is how the second piece closes, with the piano coming to a soft rest, Swanton having tamed his rampant bass into something calmer and Buck’s hand mothwinging between bright cymbal tones.\n\nAnd once it’s done it’s done. Unrepeatable, this is music that has come into being and has passed out of being in our presence. Not without its rough edges, not to the delight of every ear, but enormously impressive, utterly absorbing and entirely singular.\n",

Throughout the novel there are a number of catalogues of disturbing material. Early on Clay recalls one summer that he collected newspaper reports on acts of horrendous violence “because, I guess there were a lot to be collected.” Towards the novel’s conclusion Clay recalls a similar number of violent acts (man-made and natural) that happened whilst he was in LA; the tumult is constant. And Clay is also collecting something else, even if unconsciously: fragments that hold some meaning for him, beginning with the book’s opening line and continuing throughout.

				"title": "The Road dir. John Hillcoat (2009)",
				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>\nBut I have promises to keep,<br>\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,<br>\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last stanza, and really just those last two lines, of Robert Frost&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening&rsquo; (1923) always struck me as a little bleak; it gives an otherwise pretty poem a hint of something which might be longing or even despair. This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning novel finds a man (Viggo Mortensen) also possessed of the need to keep moving and the desire to keep promises. We witness him telling his wife (Charlize Theron) that he will &ldquo;do whatever it takes&rdquo; to help their family survive the apocalypse which is upon them, and over the 111 minutes of John Hillcoat&rsquo;s film he is put to that test again and again.</p>\n<p>Theron&rsquo;s part is fleeting, as is that of every other cast member save Mortensen and his character&rsquo;s son, The Boy, as played by 13 year old Kodi Smit-McPhee. The film boils down to two hours spent in their company as they do little more than try to survive in a blighted landscape. Hillcoat punctuates the journey nicely with set pieces such as encounters with gangs of cannibals or the discovery of a bunker stocked with food, and also with Mortensen&rsquo;s The Man remembering or dreaming of his life in the Before with his wife. The Man wakes from these dreams with a start and a cry; part of him wishes to relinquish all memory of the past as it causes him such pain. In one scene we watch as he nudges his wedding ring ever closer to a precipice, but in the end he cannot make the final push. This is what The Man seems to fear most: his inability to follow through, to keep those promises. We watch as he instructs his son on the proper way to commit suicide, and listen in as he ponders in voice-over whether he would be able to take The Boy&rsquo;s life if it came to it. Hillcoat handles this material, all of which he inherits from McCarthy, with a deft hand, never overplaying the heartache nor being afraid to show it when it is required. For all of its post-apocalyptic trappings this is at its heart a love story, and one concerned with that love rarest of all on the cinema screen: that between a father and son. McCarthy dedicates his novel to his own son, and Hillcoat and Mortensen correctly identifies that as the story&rsquo;s most powerful and most important thread.</p>\n<p>Mortensen&rsquo;s performance is necessarily understated in that his character lacks energy and is sickening as the film progresses, but he is the kind of actor who can do a lot by doing very little. Hillcoat wisely shoots his star&rsquo;s face in close-up so that we can see all of the expression Mortensen is putting behind The Man&rsquo;s words (Joe Penhall does an admirable job of appropriating and supplementing McCarthy&rsquo;s sparse and repetitive, yet beautiful, dialogue). And Smit-McPhee, in his first major role, does exceedingly well with very difficult material, which arguably requires more emotion from his character than from his fellow lead&rsquo;s. Watching him enjoy his first and probably last Coca-Cola is touching because he reacts with believable joy.</p>\n<p>Hillcoat has also assembled an impressive supporting cast, with Michael Kenneth Willams and Guy Pearce doing well with minimal screen time. If there is a performance which outshines Mortensen&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Robert Duvall as The Old Man; restrained but astonishingly emotive and moving he is every inch the defeated old soul that the film requires, giving a glimpse of what longevity might bring for The Boy. Like the film&rsquo;s protagonists The Old Man is going onwards simply because there is nothing else to do; he provides a possible answer to the Beckettian question which McCarthy is asking: of what value is it to simply carry on for the sake of carrying on?</p>\n<p>Javier Aguirresarobe&rsquo;s cinematography makes for an oddly beautiful film. Though the landscape in which the story is set is ruined his camera gives it a majesty by allowing us to see the scope and variety of the devastation. His palette is as washed out and bleak in the majority of the scenes as it is vivid and beautiful in the few remembrances The Man allows himself; one simple image of Theron in a sun-dress lingers long after the end credits. The tone of the film is also supported wonderfully by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis&rsquo;s score. Simple and haunting it is loaded with loss and longing; its composers obviously understanding the heart of the film just as well as its director and leading man. As well as the sad strings and plaintive piano of the score though, Hillcoat makes masterful use throughout of environmental noise. Almost from start to finish The Man and The Boy are surrounded by the sound of the world collapsing, giving in or straining at the seams. The tearing crash of falling trees, the groan and growl of rending earth and deep percussive booms that sound like icebergs breaking apart, all frame the landscape wonderfully and make the environment as prominent a part of the story as it should be.</p>\n<p>In many respects John Hillcoat was in a lose / lose situation when he signed on to make The Road. Had he gone for a strict adaptation of McCarthy&rsquo;s novel it would have made for a practically un-watchable film. Stray too far from the beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning source and all of its many admirers would be sure to point out his film&rsquo;s failings. Add to that the fact that the last adaptation of the author&rsquo;s work (the Coen brothers' <em>No Country For Old Men</em> (2007)) won four of the most prestigious Academy Awards and you have a project freighted with impossible expectations. Hillcoat walks this tightrope with admirable surety and he has made a film which is a perfect balance of McCarthy&rsquo;s vision and his own. It is best enjoyed as a cinematic article, divorced from the source text, but excellent performances and masterful film-making should make that easy.</p>\n",

Though the landscape in which the story is set is ruined his camera gives it a majesty by allowing us to see the scope and variety of the devastation. His palette is as washed out and bleak in the majority of the scenes as it is vivid and beautiful in the few remembrances The Man allows himself; one simple image of Theron in a sun-dress lingers long after the end credits. The tone of the film is also supported wonderfully by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's score. Simple and haunting it is loaded with loss and longing; its composers obviously understanding the heart of the film just as well as its director and leading man. As well as the sad strings and plaintive piano of the score though, Hillcoat makes masterful use throughout of environmental noise. Almost from start to finish The Man and The Boy are surrounded by the sound of the world collapsing, giving in or straining at the seams. The tearing crash of falling trees, the groan and growl of rending earth and deep percussive booms that sound like icebergs breaking apart, all frame the landscape wonderfully and make the environment as prominent a part of the story as it should be.\n\nIn many respects John Hillcoat was in a lose / lose situation when he signed on to make The Road. Had he gone for a strict adaptation of McCarthy's novel it would have made for a practically un-watchable film. Stray too far from the beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning source and all of its many admirers would be sure to point out his film's failings. Add to that the fact that the last adaptation of the author's work (the Coen brothers' *No Country For Old Men* (2007)) won four of the most prestigious Academy Awards and you have a project freighted with impossible expectations. Hillcoat walks this tightrope with admirable surety and he has made a film which is a perfect balance of McCarthy's vision and his own. It is best enjoyed as a cinematic article, divorced from the source text, but excellent performances and masterful film-making should make that easy.\n",
